Then they were defeated 3-0, more ignominiously in the Test series than in the past few weeks with an infinitely more experienced batting side as well as two proven top-class spinners. But they went on to dominate the subsequent one-day series, winning all four games comfortably.</p> <p>On hand to remind the current squad of that triumph are the captain, Eoin Morgan, and Jos Buttler, whose memories of that series may not be entirely positive. In his solitary game Buttler, selected as a specialist batsman, made his ODI debut and got a second-ball duck, so the UAE may not currently be Buttler<U+2019>s favourite venue.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/nov/06/pakistan-series-win-good-thing-england"">Why Pakistan cricket retains a breath of something gloriously pure and sporting | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those fixtures took place only three and a half years ago but it seems longer than that. A brave one-day world seemed to be on the horizon with a dynamic new opening pair carrying all before them. Alastair Cook and Kevin Pietersen strode out together, no doubt punching gloves at regular intervals, and between them they notched four centuries. A few gallons of water <U+2013> and vitriol <U+2013> have flowed under the bridge since then.</p> <p>England<U+2019>s likely opening pair this time, Alex Hales and Jason Roy, certainly possesses a certain dynamism but as yet no centuries in ODI cricket. In fact they have never come close. Between them they have managed four fifties in 29 ODI innings. Hales has been out in the UAE for a long time, probably too much of it spent with a 12th man<U+2019>s bib on his shoulders, so he should at least be acclimatised.</p> <p>But now is the time for some substantial innings. In the UAE it takes time at the start of every knock to become accustomed to the sluggish tracks. But if that is achieved, heavy run-scoring is possible.</p> <p>Hence opening the batting, against a new ball more likely to speed off the bat, is an advantage but also a major responsibility. Tantalising twenties are no good. Hales in particular may be eyeing a Test slot in South Africa, albeit in vastly different conditions. So the selectors will be keeping an eye not so much on technique as temperament. On paper at least England have only one cricketer in their squad who cannot really bat, Reece Topley, so there should be hope in every run-chase.</p> <p>To the relief of the Pakistan batsmen there will be no torment at the hands of Jimmy Anderson or Stuart Broad, both of whom were outstanding in the Test series. Neither has officially retired altogether from white-ball cricket so they may yet resurface somewhere when it is deemed to be really important, though such a strategy seems at variance with Andrew Strauss<U+2019>s eagerness to improve England<U+2019>s one<U+2011>day cricket.</p> <p>There is, however, the assumption that Anderson and Broad are now best preserved for Test cricket. And that may be their preference.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""bdbab912c6b8bfd3c916a44259f5cfbd73d62f48""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/6/1446843896641/189ccfb3-aa91-44cd-bd38-0bd8e2138fc4-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Moeen Ali"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Moeen Ali will again be under pressure during the one-day series against Pakistan.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Jason O'Brien/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The slow bowlers will again be under scrutiny. Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid were easily outgunned in the Test series, which was no surprise. Moeen has never in his limited bowling career been a successful prime spinner on a turning track, where slow bowlers are expected to take charge. So it was always a long shot that he would be able to prevail in the Test series.</p> <p>That role requires a different mind-set from being a support bowler on seaming tracks, which is when Moeen has been successful in his Test career. Oddly, the fact that the ball is turning can make life more difficult for a spinner. Expectations change and so does the intent of the best batsmen, who become more aggressive in an effort to disrupt their opponents. Moeen has never endured that peculiar pressure even in county cricket.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/06/england-trevor-bayliss-adil-rashid-south-africa-tour-cricket"">England<U+2019>s Trevor Bayliss ponders Adil Rashid<U+2019>s role for South Africa tour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Currently Moeen is more comfortable as a bowler on pitches that are not turning much and he is more likely to have an impact with a white ball when not required to go hunting for wickets. Despite the disappointments of the last month it would be a surprise if he does not continue as England<U+2019>s solitary spinner in their Test side in South Africa. But the chances of his remaining Cook<U+2019>s opening partner are slim.</p> <p>Buttler<U+2019>s immediate future is more uncertain. Here lies the trickiest decision for the selectors since it is hard to envisage all three of James Taylor, Jonny Bairstow and Buttler in the same side. Buttler, at his best, is a proven matchwinner in this form of the game, much more obviously so than in Test cricket; it was not so long ago that he was Morgan<U+2019>s vice-captain.</p> <p>Morgan clearly values Buttler<U+2019>s presence in the side. But can the selectors see any signs that he is anywhere near his best at the moment? And can they justify omitting either Taylor or Bairstow, who has been reunited with his wicketkeeping gloves in the last week?</p> <p>No doubt Pakistan can still remember being beaten so emphatically by England three years ago. This may explain why they are not too obsessed with building for future ICC tournaments. The 37-year-old Younis Khan, who was dropped after the last World Cup, <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/05/younis-khan-recalled-pakistan-england"" title="""">has been recalled</a>. Given that he was in such sparkling form in the Test series this may not delight the English bowlers greatly, especially their spinners.</p>"

I<U+2019>m now with you in the future. And here are a couple more pieces worthy of your perusal. First up, here<U+2019>s a <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/03/tom-graveney-elegant-master-batsman-who-thrilled-the-crowds"">lovely tribute to Tom Graveney</a> from Vic Marks.

And, whatever else might be said about the sometimes sluggish nature of the cricket in this series and the often weightless atmosphere in the stands, this has been a series of small margins, and a compelling and competitive one for that. One rampant session on the final day almost brought England victory in Abu Dhabi, one similar one for Pakistan on day three of Test two certainly did in Dubai, and yesterday <U+2013> over two sessions <U+2013> you sensed the <U+201C>home<U+201D> side gradually taking firm control of this one. </p> <p>A lead of 72 didn<U+2019>t feel enough for England <U+2013> not on this track, against this attack, and with <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/02/england-pakistan-ben-stokes-injury"">these hindrances</a> <U+2013> and that feeling grew as Pakistan<U+2019>s openers compiled an excellent largely untroubled opening partnership in their second innings, until a mad run-out and wickets for Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson <U+2013> Stakhanovite seam-bowling heroes of this series for England <U+2013> gave Alastair Cook<U+2019>s side a little glimmer of hope. Some disciplined bowling and resilient batting will still be required but this match remains in the balance. For now. Ah, who am I kidding? Pakistan are overwhelming favourites to inflict another UAE series defeat on England, who might take some comfort from the fact that they<U+2019>ve not been as hapless this time as in 2012.<br /></p> <p>This is how it seems on Tuesday afternoon (UK time) anyhow, for I am writing this in the past, for you to read in the doubtless jetpacked-powered future of Wednesday morning. A man<U+2019>s gotta sleep, damnit, so this preamble is being preambled early to avoid me having to get up even earlier. For while apparently the world<U+2019>s Movers and Shakers do 14 <a href=""https://twitter.com/Davos/status/661184793342775296"">terrifyingly impressive/implausible things before breakfast</a>, us mediocrity-dwelling huggers of life<U+2019>s bus lane can barely struggle beyond 1) groan, 2) make tea, 3) throw down some cursory breakfast and shovel same in direction of offspring, 4) put head in hands. And, for today, 5) compile an incisive and witty cricket liveblog for three hours or so (well, a cricket liveblog anyhow). Which is more than anyone at Davos seems capable of doing, so who are the losers now, eh?

In so doing he brought an end to the mainstay of any England resistance and deprived himself of becoming only the eighth England opener, and the first since Mike Atherton at Christchurch in 1997, to carry his bat through a completed Test innings.</p> <p>As it was in the beginning with Cook, so it was in the end, the captain standing his ground at the crease while others came and departed, four of them in a decisive first half an hour to the final day. In the first Test in Abu Dhabi he had batted for 14 hours to make 263. It was 10 hours fewer this time for his 63, but without it, England<U+2019>s second innings would have been a humiliation.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/05/alastair-cook-england-pakistan-sharjah-third-test"">England<U+2019>s Alastair Cook <U+2013> It wasn<U+2019>t good enough and we keep doing it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>England, requiring 284 to win, 238 of them on the final day, were all out for 156, with nine of the wickets <U+2013> four to Yasir, three to Shoaib Malik in what will be his final act as a Pakistan Test cricketer, and two to Zulfiqar Babar <U+2013> to the spinners with a single one to the left-armer Rahat Ali, who neck-and-cropped Adil Rashid through the gate after he and Cook had added 49 for the seventh wicket.</p> <p>That performance by the spinners in itself put into perspective one of the glaring differences between the sides. Jimmy Anderson, a truly gigantic bowler in this series, was only being perfectly truthful when he said that players have to learn fast in international cricket or their careers will be short: he may have been generalising, but there is no doubt what he meant. England had been beaten by 127 runs which along with the 178-run loss in Dubai means Pakistan win by two matches to nil. England now drop to sixth in the ICC rankings, behind New Zealand.</p> <p>Last time England came to UAE they did so with a world class all-round attack, some wonderful batsmen, and still were whitewashed, so maybe in those terms this has been an improvement. Certainly England came within a few minutes of daylight of stealing the first Test match and within a few overs of saving the second, which perhaps would have given a false impression of the differences between the two sides in these conditions.</p> <p>Pakistan have dominated England<U+2019>s spinners, while the Pakistan spinners have dominated the England batsmen. The inability to make the most of a turning pitch in Sharjah is seriously worrying and it is not for the want of serious input from the ECB, which spends a great deal of money in sending young bowlers to camps where they will find conditions such as these here, and utilising the input from great bowlers such as Dan Vettori and Shane Warne. Rashid will have learned much from listening to Warne before the game but the real input is for the longer term: there are no quick fixes when it comes to spin bowling.</p> <p>The final figures for the respective attacks are revealing. Pakistan<U+2019>s three spinners, Yasir, Shoaib and Zulfiqar, took 15, 11 and nine wickets respectively. They averaged 21.53, 20.72, and 45.44, but conceded runs at 2.6 an over, 2.92 and even with Zulfiqar, who bowled 65 more overs than Yasir and 112 more than Shoaib, 2.16. When not taking wickets, they were always able to give Misbah-ul-Haq control so that he could further attack with Wahab Riaz <U+2013> whose devastating spell clinched the second Test <U+2013> Imran Khan and Rahat.</p> <p>The England seamers were truly exceptional, with Anderson and Stuart Broad reaching levels of consistency, accuracy and skill surely unmatched by any England pair in Asian conditions. Those who felt that Anderson might have been on the decline after the West Indies tour, and certainly those who believed him to be unthreatening away from England and the Duke ball, can think again. For all-round skills there is no more complete pace bowler in the world.</p> <p>The problem though, certainly in UAE, has been that their role has been both to take wickets while at the same time stifle the opposition to compensate for the profligacy at the other end. Moeen Ali, Rashid and Samit Patel took, respectively, nine wickets at 48.66, eight at 69.5 and three at 54.66, with economy rates of 4.08, 4.06 and 3.9.</p> <p>If England<U+2019>s chances in this Test might have been enhanced by loading with seamers (and in this anyway they were not helped by the injury to Mark Wood and that during the first innings of Stokes) then there is definitely a view that unless such as Rashid play, how is he going to improve. It is a conundrum, trying to balance things between the needs of the moment and those for future development. There is also the point that, easy as it may be to criticise the performance of the spinners, they are the best ones available.</p> <p>Then we come to the batting. Four Pakistanis, Mohammad Hafeez, Misbah, Asad Shafiq and Younis Khan topped 300 runs while Shoaib Malik made 292: all of them scored more heavily than any England batsman except Cook, who made 450 runs at an average of 90. Pakistan scored five hundreds and nine fifties against Cook<U+2019>s single three-figure score, and six half-centuries.</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2015/nov/06/england-cricket-team-pakistan-test-alastair-cook-video""            data-short-url=""http://gu.com/p/4ex46""                    data-show-ads=""true""            data-video-id=""2402169""            data-video-name=""England cricket team lacks world-class spinners, says Alastair Cook <U+2013> video""            data-video-provider=""SNTV""            data-video-poster=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/11/5/1446742056443/KP_590997_crop_640x480.jpg""> <video data-media-id=""gu-video-563b8833e4b04f2498368e37"" class=""gu-video"" controls=""controls"" poster=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/11/5/1446742056443/KP_590997_crop_640x480.jpg""> <source src=""http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/11/05/151105AlastairCookCricket_desk.mp4""/><source src=""http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/11/05/151105AlastairCookCricket_small.3gp""/><source src=""http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/11/05/151105AlastairCookCricket_synd_768k_vp8.webm""/><source src=""http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/11/05/151105AlastairCookCricket.m3u8""/><source src=""http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/11/05/151105AlastairCookCricket_large.3gp""/> </video> <figcaption><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2015/nov/06/england-cricket-team-pakistan-test-alastair-cook-video"">England cricket team lacks world-class spinners, says Alastair Cook</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In essence the Pakistan batsmen were able to see out Anderson and Broad as best they could, knowing that the spinners could be played comfortably by defending the good ball well, working the gaps, and belting the daylights out of the frequent bad balls. England batsmen had less of a luxury on that score, although Cook showed what determination and a solid uncomplicated gameplan can achieve.</p> <p>The order may be changing, though. Even his most ardent supporters must concede that after 118 Tests Ian Bell is coming to the end of a fine career. At the end of the summer, he let slip that he was <U+201C> taking stock<U+201D>, and when a player starts to do that, the edge, even by the smallest margin, becomes blunted. Since his century in Antigua in April, he has averaged 20.38 in 23 innings, with four 50s only. In that time, there have been nine scores of 0 or 1. A personal view was that he should have batted at No5 in this Test anyway. Now there will be a strong debate about his participation in the South Africa series.</p> <p>Even with Cook and Joe Root at the crease, England were never really in with a shout of winning this match on the last day but any optimism there was dispelled very rapidly when, in the space of five overs, Root was lbw to Yasir on the back foot, James Taylor had edged Zulfiqur to slip, Jonny Bairstow had gone lbw as he tried to sweep Yasir, and Patel was another lbw victim for Zulfiqar, first ball. Forty-eight for two had become 59 for six and the game was done.</p>"

But this young England side can be justly pleased with how they have played for 29/30ths of the series (the 30<sup>th</sup> being that morning session on day three of the second Test) <U+2013> especially as they lost both tosses and have been over-reliant of a few players. If they can address both of those issues, a feelgood victory is a possibility.</p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2015-11-01T05:23:38.625Z"">at 5.23am GMT</time></p>  </div>"

It<U+2019>s the stock question of the non-sport fan: who<U+2019>s winning? In most sports the answer is clear, usually in a dinky scorebox to the top left of the screen, but cricket is a bit more <em>com</em>plicated than that. Due to a combination of the scoring system, changing pitch conditions and the your-turn-my-turn structure of the game, we often have no idea who is in control. Even Mark Corrigan doesn<U+2019>t think he knows who<U+2019>s winning.</p> <p>It<U+2019>s one of cricket<U+2019>s greatest charms that you can watch a match for three days and still not be certain who is in the ascendancy. Like a great film or book, it makes you do some of the work yourself. You have to use your judgement; to gather all your experience of watching <strike> England batting collapses </strike>cricket and assessing pitches in order to make a decisive call as to who is on top. And if that doesn<U+2019>t work, you can just listen to what Nasser says on Sky and pass his opinion off as your own in the pub.</p> <p>This Test is a good example of cricket<U+2019>s often inscrutable nature. To an outsider, England would seem to be in control <U+2013> they resume on 222 for four, 12 runs behind Pakistan, thanks primarily to James Taylor<U+2019>s heartwarming 74 not out. Yet the situation is a still precarious: Ben Stokes<U+2019>s injury, a pitch that could develop into a vile turner, the memory of a collapse on the third morning of the last Test, the potential terror of a run-chase to draw the series and the fact that England are, well, <em>England</em> mean that it would unwise to start celebrating a 1-1 series draw just yet. (But, crikey, what a wonderful draw it would be.)</p> <p>A first-innings lead of 100 instinctively feels like a reasonable comfort blanket. Look at it, it<U+2019>s got three figures! Those with memories of <a href=""http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakveng/engine/current/match/225443.html"">Multan 2005</a>, the Adelaide before Adelaide, would prefer a lead of, say, 700. Today, then, is a pretty crucial day in the series. By the end of it, we might even have a clear idea who<U+2019>s winning.</p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2015-11-03T05:48:47.945Z"">at 5.48am GMT</time></p>  </div>"

Ian Bell was still there, grinding and grafting, but, with Ben Stokes out of the equation, the innings, at 97 for three but in effect one wicket more, was in danger of imploding.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2015/nov/02/pakistan-v-england-third-test-day-two-live"">Pakistan v England: third Test, day two <U+2013> as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By the time Pakistan took the second new ball, 10 overs before the close, Taylor had played his way to a maiden Test half-century in only his third match. He had lost Bell an hour earlier, shuffling down the pitch to Yasir Shah<U+2019>s leg-break, and making only passing acquaintance as it spun outside his groping blade. Bell<U+2019>s 40, for which he sweated blood, took 158 balls and three and a half hours, with only 16 runs coming from him in 27 overs of an attritional middle session.</p> <p>But then Taylor found a willing partner in Jonny Bairstow. The latter had enjoyed an excellent first day behind the stumps and, like Taylor, is someone being given an unexpected chance to nail down a more permanent place in the team. The pair remained together until stumps, by which time their unbroken fifth-wicket stand was worth 83, of which Bairstow had punched his way to 37 from 94 balls, and Taylor, accelerating a little towards the end against a flagging attack, had made 74, from 141 balls.</p> <p>At 222 for four, only a dozen behind Pakistan, England have put themselves in control on a pitch that played better than it did on the first day. However, they are more than mindful the hard work has to be done in the first innings, as a chase on a wearing fifth-day pitch would be no picnic.</p> <p>For a while now Taylor has been on the fringes without breaking into the gang <U+2013> the England equivalent of the lad who turns up enthusiastically with his boots round his neck, hoping for a game only to get turned away. He simply could not get a gig. Then came Jos Buttler<U+2019>s travails and suddenly the opportunity opened up for him. It is a good cricketer who can see the chance and take it.</p> <p>This was an excellent innings, well thought out and executed. Players who are smaller than average are extremely difficult to bowl to. Where tall players can commit to the front foot and have some measure of predictability in that, short batsmen hang back.</p> <p>Bowlers need to find a fuller length but then it becomes easy to stray into half-volley territory. The batsmen are usually ferocious on the cut and pull, the cross-bat shots: there is no margin for error. And those who may see them as vulnerable to the short ball have never seen Sunil Gavaskar, Sachin Tendulkar or Gundappa Viswanath.</p> <p>Taylor worked the ball wristily, cut nicely, drove the half-volley and a couple of times opened up and pulled a long hop. Even in the heat he and Bairstow ran each run hard, so that the Pakistan fielding became ragged towards the end of the day. There is work yet to do but it was a most impressive return in a part of the world in which England batsmen have scarcely flourished.</p> <p>Until Cook<U+2019>s dismissal shortly after lunch, this looked as if it might be another masterclass from the captain. For the two hours in the morning, unless Yasir was challenging him on leg stump, he was totally in control, unobtrusive, accumulating and booked in for the duration. It is not a fast-scoring ground and on one side in particular the ball pulled up sharply as if hit into the grain. However, Cook takes what comes. Misbah-ul-Haq set clever fields that attempted to cut off Cook<U+2019>s run supply <U+2013> someone on the cut, another on the slog-sweep, someone on the orthodox sweep and so on, but the England captain began to manoeuvre the ball into areas unusual for him.</p> <p>Yasir, though, sees a vulnerability to the cluster of leg-side close fielders that he sets, one behind square and one just in front. He sees Cook pushing forward, bat in front of pad, and so probed away, looking for the edge on to the pad. Twice Cook did so and escaped, the first time when the ball looped between the fielders, the second when it rebounded too straight.</p> <p>Finally, though, after lunch, when one short of another half-century, Cook<U+2019>s defence failed him and the ball looped from inside edge to short square-leg. It was reward for Yasir<U+2019>s persistence.</p>"

Wahab is quick at times and skiddy and Moeen, as is generally the way these days, simply turned his head away rather than try to keep his eyes on the ball. The blow felled him and there was general concern from the Pakistan players, who remember all too well the Test match played out on this ground just under a year ago in the aftermath of <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/27/phillip-hughes-cricket-world-tributes"" title="""">the death of Phillip Hughes</a>. After treatment, including a preliminary concussion test, the batsman continued.</p> <p>It proved a torrid last hour or so, with the Pakistan spinners head, shoulders and standing on a ladder above their England counterparts, teasing and tantalising, spinning a web from which England will struggle to escape. By the close, they had lost two wickets, with Moeen first to go for 22, with a couple of boundaries in there, lbw attempting to work the off-spin of Shoaib Malik to leg and failing to get the decision overturned on review.</p> <p>Two balls after Moeen<U+2019>s departure, to the delight of the small but exuberant gathering of England supporters, Alastair Cook, sweeping the left-arm spin of Zulfiqar Babar, survived by the skin of his teeth and another umpire<U+2019>s call, against Pakistan<U+2019>s review. But then, with no further addition to the score, Ian Bell played inside a ball from Shoaib, delivered from round the wicket, that went on with the arm to hit off-stump and left the batsman, not for the first time this year, contemplating his future.</p> <p>In the event, Cook (17) and Joe Root (six) did well to survive the eight overs to stumps with England 46 for two, requiring a further 238 for victory.</p> <p>To stand any chance of getting back into the match, England needed an outstanding morning with the ball and in the field, but managed neither. The start was eventful enough. Cook opened with Adil Rashid and his first ball dipped in towards the leg stump of Mohammad Hafeez and struck his front pad.

It was like curling up in your bathtub during an earthquake: far from safe but at least it might afford you a moment of calm to think that everything will be OK. So, it looks like Alex Hales will finally begin his Test career against Dale Steyn and friends. If so, he would be Alastair Cook<U+2019>s eighth opening partner since the current director of cricket Andrew Strauss retired from playing. Unless he commits treason, Hales should be given a good long go. But what of Strauss<U+2019> first replacement, Nick Compton? Despite a modest county season by his standards <U+2013> over a thousand runs but just two centuries and an average below 40 <U+2013> he had a meeting with the England coach Trevor Bayliss in September to reiterate his desire to return to Test cricket. He will be in South Africa this winter <U+201C>to be ready,<U+201D> he said in a tweet, adding: <U+201C>you never know!<U+201D> It is a trip he takes regularly at this time of year, often to work with the former South Africa Test batsman Gary Kirsten, who has been <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/04/gary-kirsten-england-lions-advisory-role"" title="""">recruited by the ECB as a consultant for the England Lions</a>. Should we read much into that?</p> <h2>Moeen or Adil?</h2> <p>While South Africa, by and large, is no place for a dual-spin attack, spinners have played their part in series of three Tests or more. The last time England went there, in the 2009-10 winter, Graeme Swann led the charts with a haul of 21 wickets that saw him reach a career-high second in the ICC Test bowling rankings. More recently, twirlers have adopted more of a holding role, though that may be down to the paucity of options on the circuit. Nathan Lyon performed this role best, bowling 124 overs across three Tests, taking only eight wickets but conceding just 2.51 an over, as Australia triumphed 2-1 in 2014. This presents a conundrum for England who in Moeen and Adil Rashid have two bowlers who serve wicket-taking deliveries buried deep in the thickest of pies. The head says they will stick with Moeen, moving him back into the lower middle-order. The heart always belongs to the leggie.</p> <h2>Touch wood</h2> <p>Because of a chronic ankle problem, which Mark Wood admits will eventually require an operation, England had planned on resting him during these three Tests in the UAE. Ideally, it would have been with Steven Finn slotting in, though that plan went out the window when Finn left the tour with a foot injury. Who knows what difference Wood might have made in Sharjah, but his extra pace and ability to move the ball late, with both conventional and late swing, adds an extra dimension to England<U+2019>s pace attack. Both of those assets will be more handsomely rewarded at Durban, Cape Town, Johannesburg and Centurion. England play Tests at these four venues (in that order) in a 32-day period starting from Boxing Day. While there is a week between the second and third Test, the gap between the first and second (three days) and third and fourth (four) offers little recovery time. Given, also, that the last two venues, Johannesburg and Centurion, offer the most pace, Bayliss and his assistants need to manage Wood<U+2019>s every waking moment to military precision. Somehow, they will need to get three Tests out of him.</p> <h2>Give Jonny a chance</h2> <p>A total of 134 runs at an average of 22.33 is nothing to write home about, but watching Jonny Bairstow tough it out against Pakistan was far from exasperating. He had the odd moment of luck, something all batsmen need, but showed application and, more importantly, a technique that seems better suited to Test cricket, having used it to blitz county cricket last summer. Now, with Jos Buttler out of the side, it is Bairstow<U+2019>s time to get a proper go behind the stumps. If he is given that assurance early, then he<U+2019>ll be able to spend the next month working on his keeping. Because it does need work: the missed stumping of the second-innings centurion Mohammad Hafeez on the fourth morning was a costly blunder, similar to Buttler<U+2019>s missed effort that allowed Jermaine Blackwood to take West Indies to victory in Barbados this year. Hopefully he (and Buttler) can use the limited-overs leg of this tour to gain some confidence.</p> <h2>Bell toils </h2> <p><U+201C>When you get in over here, you really have to make it count,<U+201D> said Alastair Cook at stumps. It was a comment made while dissecting Ian Bell<U+2019>s series: scores of 63, 46 and 40 representing three missed opportunities to do him and his team a favour. His 2015 so far makes grim reading: an average of 25.95 and only five scores of 50 or more in 24 innings. Objectively, simply not good enough for a No3. In terms of alternatives, Joe Root would suit the role (given Bell<U+2019>s woes and those of Cook<U+2019>s partners, he<U+2019>s basically been batting there anyway). But there will be a reluctance to move him from a No4 spot in which he is flourishing. There is also James Taylor, who possesses the game to do what is asked of him at first-drop and impressed in Sharjah, top-scoring in the first innings with a well-constructed 76. The worry is South Africa will enjoy the same successes outside off stump as they did when they first came across him in 2012. And therein lies the depressing nature of Bell<U+2019>s command of his place <U+2013> the argument for him is made up almost entirely of the arguments against others.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/05/alastair-cook-england-pakistan-sharjah-third-test"">England<U+2019>s Alastair Cook <U+2013> It wasn<U+2019>t good enough and we keep doing it</a> </p> </aside>"

The day, however, was about to get very unusual indeed, starting when Pakistan<U+2019>s Sarfraz Nawaz began his seventh over with a wild bouncer that flew high out of the reach of Anshuman Gaekwad and plopped into the gloves of his wicketkeeper, Wasim Bari. The Pakistani umpire lodged no objection, and so Sarfraz bowled another, and another, and then one more, knowing that without the umpire<U+2019>s interference the concession of a run was not even theoretically possible.</p> <p>Bishan Bedi, India<U+2019>s captain and a team-mate at Northants of both Sarfraz and the Pakistani captain Mushtaq Mohammad, watched this from the balcony with a growing sense of fury. Four balls into the over, with his side still well placed for victory but with his sense of fair play mortally offended, he called the batsmen in and conceded the match and the series.</p> <p>It is impossible to discuss this incident without taking a couple of historical detours, the most obviously relevant having happened a couple of years earlier, the last time Bedi made a stand against the use of bouncers. That came at the culmination of a(nother) bad-tempered series, in the West Indies, with Bedi himself provoking the initial feelings of resentment during the first Test when, exercising his rights according to the letter of the law, he had refused the injured Viv Richards leave to retire hurt. Though he eventually relented the damage had been done and before the tour ended the sides were to be involved in a Test of historical hostility.</p> <p>In the fourth, final and decisive meeting in Kingston, West Indies won the toss and chose to field, immediately launching a barrage of fast bowling of such brutish venom that in the first innings Gaekwad was hit in the ear, Brijesh Patel was hit in the mouth and Gundappa Viswanath broke a finger, all three of them requiring hospitalisation.</p> <p>Bedi, who sniffed that the West Indian cocktail of approximately three-parts bouncers, two-parts beamers and the occasional yorker was <U+201C>not part of the game<U+201D> and <U+201C>a deliberate effort to subdue us<U+201D>, eventually declared his first innings at 306 for six just before he himself would have had to bat, and only six Indians were fit to participate in the second knock. West Indies were eventually set a paltry target of 13, and duly won by 10 wickets. Sunil Gavaskar said the way local fans cheered their team<U+2019>s assault <U+201C>proved beyond a shadow of doubt that these people still belonged to the jungle and forests instead of civilised country<U+201D>, while the West Indies captain Clive Lloyd insisted: <U+201C>This is cricket <U+2013> if you get hit you have to take it.<U+201D></p> <p>Clearly Bedi <U+2013> who during his retirement has been a vocal campaigner against perceived chucking, leading to a long-running feud with Muttiah Muralitharan (<U+201C>His wickets are mere run-outs in my eyes. That man is the best shot-putter in the history of cricket<U+201D>) <U+2013> was an individual whose approach to the rules was as pure as his famously impeccable bowling action.</p> <p>India<U+2019>s visit to Pakistan in 1978-79 was of not just sporting but political significance, marking as it did the teams<U+2019> first meeting for nearly 18 years, during which time there had been two wars on the subcontinent. Though the tourists were lavishly welcomed at the airport, neither side can be accused of approaching their cricket in an atmosphere of reconciliatory bonhomie.</p> <p>The start of the final day<U+2019>s play in the first Test was delayed by 11 minutes because Gavaskar was busy arguing with Shakoor Rana, the umpire who was to provoke Mike Gatting into <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AizLOspJ--Y"">one of the most notorious instances of on-field rag-losing nine years later</a>. In the second Test, which ended two days before the controversial third ODI, India<U+2019>s Mohinder <U+201C>Jimmy<U+201D> Amarnath was laid out by an Imran Khan bouncer, went to hospital for x-rays and then returned to the ground to resume his innings, whereupon he was welcomed, first ball back, by a Sarfraz bumper aimed at his unprotected, helmet-free head.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""ff59cc31428a88d9625bda9f908541182850dfaf""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/ff59cc31428a88d9625bda9f908541182850dfaf/58_60_2929_1757/1000.jpg"" alt=""India<U+2019>s Mohinder <U+201C>Jimmy<U+201D> Amarnath is laid out by an Imran Khan bouncer during the 2nd Test against Pakistan in 1978-79."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">India<U+2019>s Mohinder <U+201C>Jimmy<U+201D> Amarnath is laid out by an Imran Khan bouncer during the 2nd Test against Pakistan in 1978-79.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Patrick Eagar/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Pakistan <U+2013> whose team was quite exceptional at the time, containing not only Imran and Sarfraz but also Javed Miandad, Asif Iqbal, Mudassar Nazar and Zaheer Abbas <U+2013> won that match, ending a run of 13 successive draws between the sides, the nation declared a public holiday.</p> <p>Amarnath<U+2019>s heroic return to the crease was, incidentally, not a one-off for a player who built a reputation for fearlessness, if not necessarily for technical excellence, in the face of the short ball. <U+201C>What separated Jimmy from the others was his great ability to withstand pain,<U+201D> said Michael Holding, who was in the West Indies side when Amarnath had several teeth knocked out by Malcolm Marshall at the Kensington Oval in 1983 only to again resume batting after a quick trip to hospital. <U+201C>A fast bowler knows when a batsman is in pain, but Jimmy would stand up and continue.<U+201D></p> <p>Not only was he naturally disinclined to back down, he would have been further motivated in Pakistan given that the second Test was played in Lahore, where his father, Lala Amarnath <U+2013> famous for being the first man to score a Test century for India and for so emphatically falling out with the Maharajah of Vizianagram, his team<U+2019>s egomaniacal captain, that he was sent home from the tour of England in 1936 <U+2013> had been brought up. Lala was commentating on the match for Pakistani television, and to add to the sense of family occasion Jimmy<U+2019>s elder brother, Surinder, was also in the India side.</p> <p><U+201C>There is no doubt that we were up against a better and more determined home team,<U+201D> Bedi wrote, many years later. <U+201C>What took us by much greater surprise was the extreme hostility from the public and the media <U+2013> and the umpires, if I may say so. Lest I sound like a bad loser, let me assure all and sundry that we were comprehensively beaten by a much superior team. If the overall cricket environment did not suit us, well, it was not supposed to.<U+201D></p> <p>The perception of bias in Pakistani (and global) officiating led directly to the adoption of neutral umpires, while the ICC acted in 1991 against the overuse of bouncers. It would be hard to argue that either of these decisions have hurt the sport in any way, and anyone old enough to remember Gatting<U+2019>s altercation with Rana cannot help but marvel occasionally at the standard of modern umpiring, which has allowed, for example, the participants in the current series between England and Pakistan to concentrate entirely (if not always successfully) on their own pursuit of excellence.</p> <p>Sarfraz<U+2019>s four bouncers thus deserve a small footnote in the history of a sport which has been to a great extent shaped by miscreants and their misdemeanours, by the panicked closure of loopholes shortly after they have been exploited and a succession of administrators who are apparently totally unable to spot a stable door, let alone bolt one, until someone has already guided a horse through it.</p> <p>The golden age of rule-bending started perhaps in 1771, when Chertsey<U+2019>s Thomas White attempted to avoid dismissal by using a bat that was as wide as the wicket <U+2013> <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/22/the-spin-thomas-daddy-white-super-blade-pioneer"">as celebrated by Mike Selvey in the Spin but a few weeks ago</a> <U+2013> and lasted for in excess of 200 years. Highlights include Mike Brearley<U+2019>s decision to place every English fielder, including the wicketkeeper, on the rope to prevent West Indies scoring the boundary they needed to win an ODI in 1979 and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quJ018In8Ow"">Trevor Chappell<U+2019>s infamous underarm delivery to Brian McKechnie</a>, with identical intent, during a game between Australia and New Zealand two years later. (To return to somewhere approaching where we started, when India<U+2019>s Ravi Shastri was asked if he would ever adopt a similar tactic, he replied: <U+201C>Against Pakistan I would.<U+201D>)</p> <p>Laws continue to be tweaked in response to players<U+2019> innovations <U+2013> there was an update this September to clarify the rules regulating the movement of fielders before a batsman hits the ball, a response to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3m7nE_qMYc"">Steve Smith<U+2019>s sprint from slip into the leg side to catch Pakistan<U+2019>s Fawad Alam</a> in Abu Dhabi last year <U+2013> but sledging aside instances of outright villainy no longer appear to be part of the game.</p> <p>Again, this isn<U+2019>t exactly a bad thing, and one can only imagine how frustrating it would have been to be, say, a paying customer at Worcester on the day in 1979 when Somerset<U+2019>s Brian Rose declared his team<U+2019>s innings after one over and a single run in order to exploit a loophole in the regulations of the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup and guarantee his side<U+2019>s progress, but over time these tales have become part of the game<U+2019>s cherished folklore.

He barely made it out of the house, carried by his wife and children, before the earthquake levelled three rooms and the kitchen wall.</p> <p>Providing for Husain<U+2019>s family of 11 will now be even tougher for its two breadwinners, 16-year-old Muneer and his 15-year-old brother.

This is a White House which infamously promised to be the most transparent in history and instead became one of the most secretive; the executive branch <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/24/us/politics/transcript-of-obamas-speech-on-drone-policy.html"">promised similar things</a> in 2013 after a major speech where Obama laid out new <U+201C>rules<U+201D> for drone strikes, and <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/12/state-of-the-union-drones_n_2626160.html"">in a State of the Union address</a> where he promised to be more transparent. </p> <p>More than two years later, almost all of the <U+201C>promises<U+201D> he made <a href=""https://www.justsecurity.org/1462/transparency-targeted-killings-promises-made-progress/"">have been ignored or disregarded</a> by the administration. The administration reportedly <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/20/americas-drone-policy-all-exceptions-no-rules-yemen"">immediately issued waivers</a> for at least one of the rules in Pakistan and then in Yemen, the two countries where the vast majority of CIA drone strikes take place (the rules never even applied to Afghanistan).</p> <p>The few actions the administration has taken <U+2013> finally acknowledging in public that drone strikes exist and releasing one of the many legal memos discussing when drones can assassinate American citizens <U+2013> were only spurred on by constant news reports and leaks, coupled with lawsuits that forced their hand.</p> <p>The idea that the secrecy surrounding drone strikes was for <U+201C>national security purposes<U+201D> rather than just preventing public and legal scrutiny was always specious to begin with but has been blown to pieces in recent months. While claiming they were being <U+201C>transparent<U+201D> about a <U+201C>counterterrorism operation<U+201D> in April that killed innocent hostages, the administration wouldn<U+2019>t even acknowledge out loud that it was <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/24/the-hostages-killed-by-us-drones-are-the-casualties-of-an-inhumane-policy"">actually a drone strike that was to blame</a>. The <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-kept-looser-rules-for-drones-in-pakistan-1430092626"">Wall Street Journal reported</a> after the incident that <U+201C>the Attorney General<U+2019>s office warned Mr Obama that publicly disclosing the CIA<U+2019>s role in this case would undermine the administration<U+2019>s standing in a series of pending lawsuits challenging its legality.<U+201D></p> <p>Beyond the potential for challenging the legality of the program, the more transparent the administration is, the more public scrutiny would inevitably come of the effectiveness of the program. The Intercept<U+2019>s <a href=""https://theintercept.com/drone-papers"">recent (and excellent) <U+201C>Drone Papers<U+201D> investigation</a> <U+2013> based on documents provided by an unnamed whistleblower <U+2013> showed that almost nine out of 10 strikes killed people other than the intended target, and that these people - whether they were innocent civilians or not <U+2013> were automatically labeled <U+201C>enemies killed in action<U+201D>.</p> <p>The New York Times <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html"">reported</a> that any <U+201C>military age male<U+201D> in the vicinity of a drone strikes was labeled a combatant after they were killed years ago, but the administration outright denied it. Now it<U+2019>s sitting here in black and white.</p> <p>It makes you wonder if government can ever be honest about its drone strikes without exposing that the program is <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/drone-war-yemen-al-qaeda/407599/"">creating more terrorists than it<U+2019>s killing</a>.

Tall, slim of shoulder and gifted with rare elegance, he seemed to belong naturally at the batting crease. Indeed, his relaxed countryman image caused the dour England captain <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/04/cricket1"">Len Hutton</a> to nurse reservations about him. For his part, the affable Graveney was convinced that Hutton had no trust in any cricketer with rosy cheeks.</p> <p>First chosen for England in 1951 against South Africa, Graveney went on to play in 79 Tests, the last in 1969. Yet only occasionally, despite some striking performances, was he an automatic choice. Partly this was down to Hutton<U+2019>s early misgivings, but it was also due to Graveney<U+2019>s frustrating inability to consistently project himself as a rock solid presence at international level. The <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/feb/18/tom-graveney-mike-selvey"">grace and ease with which he batted</a> perhaps enhanced this impression, though the sheer breadth of his achievements - including more than 100 first class hundreds <U+2013> belied it.</p> <p>Born in Riding Mill, Northumberland, Graveney was six when his father, Jack, died, and he was 11 when his mother, Mary, took him and his elder brother, Ken, to live in Bristol. Thereafter Tom was to be regarded as a West Country man, enrolling at Bristol grammar school. Ken, who played for Gloucestershire either side of a long absence with a back injury, and once took all 10 wickets against Derbyshire, saw second world war service, landing in Normandy on D-day. Tom joined the Gloucestershire regiment in 1945 for two years, serving in Egypt and batting on concrete pitches, before returning to secure a contract with the county club. On his Gloucestershire debut in 1948 his batsmanship was instantly perceived as high class.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/01/tom-graveney-obituary-letter"">Letter: <U+2018>We walked to Tom Graveney<U+2019>s sports shop to find our hero himself behind the counter<U+2019></a> </p> </aside>  <p>On his first overseas tour for England (1951-52) Graveney stroked 175 in a Bombay Test, and in the memorable summer of 1953, against Australia, he was part of a celebrated Ashes winning side. But a 92 in Trinidad was his main offering in the classic 1953-54 England tour of the Caribbean, and the following winter he was selected only twice in the winning series in Australia. At least triumph came at the end of the tour when he composed a century in the fifth Test at Sydney, his only 100 against the Aussies. Pink-faced and perspiring profusely at a drinks break when he had scored 86, upon resumption Graveney stroked <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/12/guardianobituaries.cricket"">Keith Miller</a> for four fours in the next over. Later he chalked up his only Test wicket when Colin McDonald nicked a leg-break to <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/may/04/guardianobituaries2"">Godfrey Evans</a>.</p> <p>There was a short time when Graveney found himself opening the innings for England, not a preferred position. But when the 1956 Australians arrived he was moving back down the order, short of runs, and without a guaranteed place in the Test team. He was not chosen for the 1956-57 tour of South Africa even though he had just made 2,397 runs (49.93) in the summer, which remained his richest return. Restored to the England team in 1957, he followed a duck against West Indies at Lord<U+2019>s with 258 at Trent Bridge, which was to be his highest first-class score, and in England<U+2019>s third innings victory of that series he made 164 at The Oval in the final Test. However, some more forgettable Test matches followed, including during one of England<U+2019>s worst-ever series in Australia in 1958-59, and there were no Tests for him in 1959.</p> <p>All the while Graveney was pleasing crowds across the land as he gathered runs for his county, which he captained in 1959 and 1960. Then came a fall-out with the county hierarchy, Graveney being unceremoniously stripped of the captaincy as a perceived cure for the general problems facing the club. In 1961, with emotions running high, especially among Gloucestershire members, he began a new career with Worcestershire, which he was to serve for 10 summers, the last three as captain. His achievement of playing more than 200 first-class matches for two counties remains unmatched.</p> <p>By the time of his move to Worcestershire, Graveney<U+2019>s Test career had seemed to be over <U+2013> until he was recalled in 1962, just before his 35th birthday. He showed his gratitude with 97 against Pakistan at Edgbaston, 153 at Lord<U+2019>s, and 114 at Trent Bridge, but did little in the middle order for England in Australia in the turgid 1962-63 series, and a further period of international exclusion followed. Then he was surprisingly recalled for the 1966 home series against West Indies. It was a popular and dramatic comeback: he returned in style with 96 at Lord<U+2019>s and 109 at Trent Bridge in the third Test.</p> <p>England took a pounding that summer, but in the final encounter at The Oval Graveney was again at his lyrical best, making 165 and sharing an amazing eighth-wicket stand of 217 with John Murray (112). When Ken Higgs and John Snow put on an unlikely 128 for the 10th wicket, lifting the total to 527, England were on their way to a consolation victory by an innings under <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/14/brian-close"">Brian Close</a><U+2019>s bulldog leadership.</p> <p>Next summer saw another beguiling performance by Graveney, 151 at Lord<U+2019>s against India<U+2019>s trio of master spin bowlers, Erapalli Prasanna, Bhagwat Chandrasekhar and Bishan Bedi. And the question continued to reverberate: how could the selectors have overlooked him so often? He toured the Caribbean early in 1968, making 118 in Trinidad in the opening Test, but managed only one 50 thereafter in a series that was snatched 1-0 by England. During an ill-tempered Jamaica Test he gave in to frustration by tossing his bat 30 yards after his freakish dismissal when caught by midwicket via short leg<U+2019>s body. It was a highly unusual move for such a good-natured man.</p> <p>The 1968 Ashes summer found him still in the middle order, and he made 96 at Edgbaston, then at Headingley he captained England (for the only time) when <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/dec/06/guardianobituaries.mikeselvey"">Colin Cowdrey</a> was injured. A draw secured the Ashes for Australia.</p> <p>At the age of 41 Graveney went on a further tour of Pakistan in 1969, playing three Tests during fearful public and political disturbances that eventually led to abandonment of the tour. He scored 105 in a large stand with <a href=""http://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/colin-milburn-the-stocky-england-opening-batsman-who-lost-his-left-eye-in-a-car-accident-32511"">Colin Milburn</a> in that truncated series, and three months later he hit 75 against West Indies at Old Trafford in a winning cause, but was then suspended for having played in a benefit match on the rest day. It was a teeth-gnashing way to end a superb international career.</p> <p>Graveney<U+2019>s Test career over 18 years had brought him 4,882 runs at an average of 44.38, with 11 hundreds. Now into his 40s, he squeezed in a couple of further summers with Worcestershire, raising his impressive first-class output to 47,793 runs at 44.92, with 122 hundreds (seven of them 200 or more).</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/08/childhood-memories-of-tom-graveney"">Childhood memories of Tom Graveney | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the end of his career, in late 1970, he signed up as a player-coach for Queensland in Australia, playing four matches for the state in the Sheffield Shield.

The Baroipara killing came after the murders of two foreigners <U+2013> an Italian and a Japanese national in Bangladesh <U+2013> which were both claimed by Islamic State, which is <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/06/isis-possible-culprits-suspected-plane-attack"">suspected of bombing the Russian holiday jet in Egypt</a> last weekend. Then there has been the series of <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/31/faisal-abedin-deepan-bangladesh-secular-publisher-hacked-to-death"">murders of secular intellectuals, bloggers and publishers</a>. Five have now died over the last year. These murders have been claimed by a local affiliate of al-Qaida in the Indian subcontinent.</p> <p>Many in Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority country of 160 million-plus, are now frightened. <U+201C>I am working in the university and all my friends are really panicked. No one knows what could happen or when,<U+201D> said <a href=""http://www.dw.com/en/why-being-openly-secular-can-get-you-killed/a-18557741"">Shantanu Majumder</a>, a political scientist and activist. <U+201C>Bangladesh has changed completely. This is not our usual, easy life. The [extremists] may not be strong enough to start a civil war, but they are strong enough to continue their killing mission.<U+201D></p> <p>There is no doubt that such anxiety is real and justified, and al-Qaida and Isis have thus succeeded in attaining the goal of all such militant groups: to terrorise their enemies, mobilise existing supporters and polarise communities to create the conditions that favour extremism.</p> <p>The entry of the two groups into Bangladesh is relatively recent; the ground for their horrific campaigns of violence there has been prepared by historical, social, economic and political factors reaching back almost 50 years, if not longer.</p> <p>The borders of modern Bangladesh were drawn in 1947, when the British divided their south Asian empire. Most Muslim-majority areas became part of Pakistan, which was itself split into east and west wings. In 1971, civil war broke out between local nationalists in East Pakistan who wanted independence and those who did not. The former, on the whole, spoke the local language of Bangla, favoured socialist-style economic policies and desired a liberal, secular framework for their new nation. Most of those who favoured a continued union with Pakistan were religiously and socially conservative.</p> <p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/21/ian-jack-bangladesh-war-genocide"">The ensuing conflict was brutal</a>, with hundreds of thousands killed and some of the worst atrocities committed by militias recruited by Pakistani forces, but <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/24/bangladesh-at-40"">resulted in an independent country</a> with a secular constitution.

She heads the Awami League.

The two women make little effort to hide their mutual hatred.</p> <p>Then there is the Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist political party and social movement which resisted independence and was <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/13/bangladesh-islamist-abdul-quader-mollah-execution-protests"">implicated in some of the worst abuses</a>.</p> <p>All the parties have battled bitterly over the years, through the ballot box, political manoeuvres, cynical short-term alliances and on the streets. But if history has left a troubled legacy, so too has economic change.</p> <p>The view from the battered bridge over the <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/media/gallery/2015/jan/29/photo-highlights-of-the-day#img-4"">Buriganga</a> river in the centre of Dhaka is apocalyptic. In the foreground are the black, heavily polluted waters of the river itself. Beyond lies Kamrangir Char, a vast slum where clouds of acrid smoke from burning rubbish hide tenements packed with thin men, anxious women and grubby children with tubercular coughs.</p> <p>But Kamrangir Char is also a thriving community and informal economic hub. Millions flock to similar slums in Dhaka and elsewhere every year, flowing in from rural areas hit by climate change-induced <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2015/sep/10/flooding-in-bangladesh-in-pictures"">flooding</a>, overcultivation and unemployment. For all its problems, the slums, and Bangladesh<U+2019>s chaotic, congested cities more generally, act as launching pads into better lives than many could ever have lived in their remote villages.</p> <p>Recent years have seen steady economic growth. Incomes and literacy levels have risen. Infant malnutrition and maternal mortality are down. One factor is the $25bn garment business, which makes cheap clothes for the west and employs at least four million people. The <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/bangladesh-factory-building-collapse-community"">deaths of 1,000 workers when a garment factory collapsed</a> in 2013 underlined problems of poor safety and conditions, but <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/sep/25/sheikh-hasina-i-want-to-make-bangladesh-poverty-free-sustainable-development-goals"">the days when Bangladesh was dismissed as a <U+201C>basket case<U+201D> are long gone</a>.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""818a496412f7be258fbb4fb5b9180b323fb548ed""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/818a496412f7be258fbb4fb5b9180b323fb548ed/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg"" alt=""Women at work in a Bangladeshi garment factory"" width=""1000"" height=""667"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Women at work in a Bangladeshi garment factory.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Demotix/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As elsewhere in the Islamic world, however, development has not ended the threat of radicalism. Indeed, some believe it may even have fuelled it.</p> <p>According to one western intelligence official based in the region, those least equipped to thrive in the new better-off Bangladesh are young men, often from rural backgrounds but raised in the big city, whose poor education and lack of skills, social or professional, is a huge disadvantage amid cut-throat competition for jobs, money, status and eligible marriage partners. <U+201C>Many, many Islamic militant recruits in Bangladesh and more broadly across the Islamic world match that profile, and that is no coincidence,<U+201D> the official said.</p> <p>Others, however, deny the link. <U+201C>In principle, everyone wins from growth. This is a broader phenomenon. No Islamic country has been untouched by the global crosscurrent of radicalism in recent years,<U+201D> said Ahsan Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute, a Dhaka-based thinktank.</p> <p>As elsewhere, Bangladesh<U+2019>s new global commercial and cultural links are also a factor. The millions of Bangladeshi migrant workers in places such as Qatar or Saudi Arabia are exposed to austere styles of Islam very different from the traditional, folksy forms of worship of their homeland. Over decades, cash from the Gulf has funded religious seminaries and institutions in Bangladesh.</p> <p>Clerics at one such school in Kamrangir Char told the <em>Guardian</em> two years ago that <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/16/bangladesh-hefazat-e-islam-women"">their primary aim was to stop <U+201C>alien [western] culture<U+201D> making inroads </a>in Bangladesh. Several of those detained for the recent militant attacks were seminary students. Such institutions teach hardline unitarian dogmas which, even if they are theoretically non-violent, are certainly intolerant.</p> <p>Then there is the impact of nearly 15 years of conflict, invasion and rhetoric across the Islamic world, relayed by social media. This, <a href=""http://www.dhakatribune.com/op-ed/2015/nov/06/why-have-we-sounded-death-knell-secularism"">according to columnist Shuprova Tasneem, has contributed to <U+201C>a growing distrust of western concepts of secularism</a>, viewed as an ideology that not only disassociates religion from state affairs but attempts to reduce its influence in our private lives as well.<U+201D></p> <p>There have long been signs of rising radicalism. Attacks on Christians and Hindus have intensified. Last month Bangladesh<U+2019>s small <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/24/bomb-attack-on-bangladesh-shia-community"">Shia Muslim community <U+2013> reviled as heretics in many Gulf countries <U+2013> were targeted by a bomb claimed by Isis</a>. Yet the final impetus to the new violence may have come from the very people who say they want to stop it.</p> <p>Shortly after returning to power in 2009, the new Awami League government set up a special tribunal to try those allegedly responsible for atrocities in the 1971 war. The party said it was bringing closure through justice. Many, though not all, of those in the dock were senior Islamists, and human rights groups were critical of the trials. The <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/13/bangladesh-islamist-abdul-quader-mollah-execution-protests"">sentences that were pronounced by the court led to huge protests</a> and counter-protests by supporters and opponents of the process. <U+201C>The trial of the war criminals is key. The problems all started then,<U+201D> said Majumder, the political scientist.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""ce7ab5f8cfd9898de7f4b5008b4b5cc28720770d""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/ce7ab5f8cfd9898de7f4b5008b4b5cc28720770d/0_215_3500_2099/1000.jpg"" alt=""Jamaat-e-Islami supporters set fire to a bus in protest at sentences handed down by a war crimes tribunal in 2013"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Jamaat-e-Islami supporters set fire to a bus in protest at sentences handed down by a war crimes tribunal in 2013.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In January 2014, Bangladesh held a widely criticised <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/05/bangladesh"">election boycotted by the BNP and other opposition parties</a>. The Awami League won, but the poll triggered intense street violence. Hundreds were killed or injured in firebombings and riots as the opposition tried to oust the government. With many of its leaders detained or in hiding, the BNP has been almost eliminated as a political force. So, too, have the Islamists of Jamaat-e-Islami. The result is no credible opposition <U+2013> and no democratic channel to express dissent.</p> <p><U+201C>The <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/21/bangladesh-prime-minister-rejects-accusations-of-authoritarian-rule"">crackdown</a> has been so hard that it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy in terms of extremism,<U+201D> said Michael Kugelman, a south Asia expert at the Woodrow Wilson Centre in Washington DC.</p> <p>Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister, denies that Isis exists in Bangladesh. <a href=""http://www.theindependentbd.com/post/17952"">She blames opposition parties both for the recent killings</a> and for the broader problem of extremism.

But it would help his cause, the lawyer argued, by addressing several of the knotty issues related to his future. </p> <p>The first of those is the question of where he would go were he released.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union he began openly to practice his Muslim faith and began to endure hostility and prejudice from within the army as a result, prompting his decision in 2000 to take his family out of the country to live in Tajikistan.</p> <p>From there he relocated to Afghanistan shortly before the start of the post-9/11 US war against the Taliban and when conditions became untenable there, moved again to Pakistan where he was eventually arrested by Pakistani police.</p> <p>The US accuses him, though without ever pressing charges, of having joined the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) which is listed as a terrorist organization, attending a military training camp in Afghanistan, fighting with the Taliban and later joining al-Qaida.

Everyone talks in the pumped-up argot of entrepreneurialism <U+2013> <U+201C>passionate<U+201D>, <U+201C>ready to go<U+201D> <U+2013> except presenter Jason Manford, who semi-vomits his patter. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2><br />Class of 92: Out of their League<br />9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Everyone loves an underdog story. The trouble with this two-part documentary <U+2013> which has followed five of Fergie<U+2019>s Manchester United stalwarts as they try to help Salford FC to promotion <U+2013> is that it doesn<U+2019>t really feel like one. Sure, Salford FC is skint and shabby. But so, surely, are all of their opponents, who lack such notable backers. Hard to take against anyone involved (particularly the likable Neville brothers) but however it<U+2019>s spun, it<U+2019>s difficult to truly get behind these fortunate footballing minnows. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <h2>The Last Kingdom<br />9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>In tonight<U+2019>s episode of the Saxon drama, Brida voices the feelings of many a foreign visitor to England when she asks of the population: <U+201C>Why are they so different, so miserable?<U+201D> Still, for all her insight, the drama is mainly elsewhere as Uhtred, having been instrumental in Alfred<U+2019>s success in battle, now tries to convert that into cash and lands. With King Aethelred wounded, it<U+2019>s not an approach that wins him immediate respect <U+2013> but the grubby insinuations of Aethelwold towards the throne, as encouraged by young Odda, are more artless still. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2><strong>Unforgotten</strong><br />9pm, ITV</h2> <p>More skeletons come tumbling out of closets in this superior whodunnit, ruled by Nicola Walker. Father Robert has news for his family and the police, while Ray returns home to an empty house. Sir Phillip Cross is desperate to get back on track but how far will he go to protect his family? No spoilers, but the revelations are big this week. Every member of the cast is famous enough to be a killer, so DCI Stuart and DS Khan have a mystery of Broadchurch proportions on their hands. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2><strong>Chris Tarrant: Extreme Railway Journeys</strong><br />9pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>Tarrant has proved good company during these rail rides, amiable and giddy in a way that Michael Portillo, TV<U+2019>s other prominent caboose-hopper, could never match. The series wraps up with the Tiswas ringmaster travelling 2,500 miles west across Canada, including a leg on the famous Rocky Mountaineer. Its carriages look luxurious rather than extreme, so Tarrant goes up in a helicopter loaded with TNT to witness how potentially deadly avalanches are pre-empted by controlled explosions. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2><strong>Detectorists</strong><br />10pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Another round of excavations in Mackenzie Crook<U+2019>s wonderfully beguiling comedy drama. While Lance (Toby Jones) practises his conversation starters before an encounter at the Lemon Tree (<U+201C>Did you know 90% of onions are consumed in their country of origin?<U+201D>), Sophie and Peter are getting closer <U+2013> and a worried mayor enlists the Danebury Metal Detecting Club<U+2019>s help in finding his chain of office, dropped somewhere up the hill in the bushes in Barnfather Woods, near <U+201C>where all the cars go after dark<U+201D>. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Aqua Teen Hunger Force Forever<br />11pm, FOX</h2> <p>As far as adult cartoons are concerned, this offering from US channel Adult Swim is one of the strangest around. Over the course of its 14-year run, it<U+2019>s had five different titles and more bizarre fast-food-themed plots than you can shake a possessed sandwich at. As its 11th and final season gets under way, the gang are contractually obliged to promote <U+201C>Honest Abe Lincoln<U+2019>s Beef Jerky<U+201D>, Meatwad loses his mouth and a Christian robot wreaks havoc in a rare live-action twist. Bonkers and boisterous fun. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2>Film Choice</h2> <p><strong>True Romance<br /></strong>(Tony Scott, 1993), 12midnight, Dave<br />A hot and heavy thriller from a master of the craft. Christian Slater (now a grizzled cyber-saboteur in Mr Robot) is a fresh-faced comic-book shop assistant, Patricia Arquette a hooker. They fall in love and hit the road for Hollywood, with dead pimp Gary Oldman<U+2019>s coke stash. Christopher Walken is the mobster on their trail, with whom Dennis Hopper, as Slater<U+2019>s honourable cop dad, shares the film<U+2019>s best scene. <em>Paul Howlett</em> </p> <p><strong>The Omen<br /></strong>(Richard Donner, 1976), 1am, Film4<br />When people call young Damien a little devil, they ain<U+2019>t kidding: the adopted son of American ambassador Gregory Peck and Lee Remick is the son of Satan. Quality horror, this: scary without overly resorting to gore, the hair-raising Ave Satani screeching away in the background and a cast <U+2013> including David Warner, Billie Whitelaw and Leo McKern <U+2013> that takes it seriously. Far better than the pointless 2006 remake. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Today<U+2019>s best live sport</h2> <p><strong>Test Cricket: Pakistan v England</strong> The final day of the series from Sharjah. 6am, Sky Sports 2</p> <p><strong>ATP Tennis: The Paris Masters</strong> Coverage of the fourth day at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy. 10.30am, Sky Sports 1</p> <p><strong>Europa League Football</strong> More games from the consolation prize competition, including Celtic v Molde.

Around the world, we have found great interest in learning from and adapting UK innovations ranging from social impact bonds to the <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/british-council-partner-zone/2015/jul/21/the-community-interest-company-legal-structure-turns-10-years-old"">Community Interest Company</a>. Here are some examples of such knowledge exchange in practice.</p> <h2>Influencing the influencers</h2> <p>In October we invited two government ministers and 37 leaders from civil society, academia, and finance in nine Asian and African countries to London to participate in the <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/british-council-partner-zone/2015/sep/25/what-is-the-critical-mass-needed-for-a-social-enterprise-to-make-a-difference"">Critical Mass conference</a> and meet with influential actors on the UK social enterprise scene. <br /></p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/british-council-partner-zone/2015/oct/16/social-enterprise-takes-centre-stage-in-scotland"">Social enterprise takes centre stage in Scotland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These visitors all shape or influence policy in their countries, and their London programme was designed to provide multiple perspectives on the UK social economy and answer their probing questions about its development, features and shortcomings. </p> <h2>Sector champions</h2> <p>On the programme were visits to well established UK social enterprises such as Better, which manages the London<U+2019>s Olympic Aquatics Centre and supports regeneration in East London, and the Big Issue, a <U+201C>street<U+201D> newspaper which offers its more than 2000 venders, many of whom have experienced homelessness, a business opportunity to take control of their lives. </p> <h2>A voice for the sector</h2> <p>The delegates met with Baroness Glenys Thornton, the shadow equalities minister in the House of Lords, who was the founding chair of the Social Enterprise Coalition (which became Social Enterprise UK). In retracing the formation of that body, Baroness Thornton explained why it had been so important to build a big tent movement that provides a national voice for the sector. She explained that the coalition had lobbied all political parties and equipped supportive legislators with the research data they needed to push through important legislation. </p> <h2>Government support</h2> <p>Social Enterprise UK<U+2019>s current chair, Claire Dove OBE, spoke to the delegates about another consequential piece of legislation, the Social Value Act (2013), which requires officials to consider social and environmental impact when contracting for public services. Claire explained that the Act is helping government to get a lot more value from every penny it invests, providing more opportunities for social enterprises to tackle entrenched challenges in their communities, and spurring the private sector to demonstrate social impact. <br /></p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/british-council-partner-zone/2015/sep/25/what-is-the-critical-mass-needed-for-a-social-enterprise-to-make-a-difference"">What is the critical mass needed for a social enterprise to make a difference?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kieron Boyle, the head of social finance at Cabinet Office, spoke about the substantial value of the social economy, noting that there were 180,000 charities, social enterprises and other social sector organisations in the UK. He then outlined the financing support that the UK government is providing through its investment and contract readiness fund, Big Society Capital, social investment tax relief and other initiatives. Kieron also detailed efforts to promote the social economy globally and attract foreign social entrepreneurs and social investors to the UK. </p> <h2>The ABCs </h2> <p>Social enterprise education was a recurring theme. At the Critical Mass conference, the British Council<U+2019>s CEO, Sir Ciar<U+00E1>n Devane, said that schools should teach entrepreneurship as well as social responsibility. (The British Council is developing a Social Enterprise Schools<U+2019> Programme with the Social Enterprise Academy and the Real Ideas Organisation for use in schools in the UK and overseas.) </p> <p>Kevin van Cauter, the British Council<U+2019>s higher education consultant, noted that at least 70 of the UK<U+2019>s 168 universities and higher education institutions have a significant amount of social enterprise activity and that 114 of them had a formal affiliation with at least one social enterprise. The drivers for this include student demand for marketable skills and desire to contribute to society; the growth of social enterprise globally; and the universities<U+2019> mission to support their local communities. </p> <h2>Scaling social impact</h2> <p>At Critical Mass, the visitors heard speakers advocating the need for collaboration across sectors to scale up the social sector. As Michael Green of the Social Progress Initiative put it, <U+201C>It<U+2019>s not about social enterprises replacing business. It<U+2019>s about collaboration between the sectors.<U+201D> <br /></p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/british-council-partner-zone/2015/aug/20/are-anglo-american-social-enterprise-models-stunting-the-social-economys-growth"">Are Anglo-American social enterprise models stunting the social economy<U+2019>s growth?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For such collaboration to flourish, it is essential to build trust and understanding between a range of sectors said Mairi Mackay, the British Council<U+2019>s global lead, social enterprise. And as Kevin Lynch, the former head of the Social Enterprise Alliance in the US put it, <U+201C>big business, small business, big capital, small capital, non-profits and for-profits - for us to do this work it requires these strange bedfellows to develop a trust that we haven<U+2019>t had before.<U+201D></p> <h2>Future prospects</h2> <p>The visit provided many chances for the participants to share their experiences and plans with UK counterparts and lay the groundwork for future collaboration. For instance, the Pakistan officials revealed their intention to roll out social enterprise education at the undergraduate and graduate levels. And Dr Spio-Garbrah, Ghana<U+2019>s minster of trade and industry, announced that his government would work with the British Council and other stakeholders to implement social enterprise legislation within two years.</p> <p><strong>Content on this page is paid for and provided by the <a href=""http://www.britishcouncil.org/society/social-enterprise"" rel=""nofollow"">British Council</a>, sponsor of the <a href=""http://preview.gutools.co.uk/sustainable-business/series/international"" rel=""nofollow"">international social enterprise hub</a></strong></p>"

It<U+2019>s a rather lovely place <U+2013> an old manor house with beautifully planted gardens <U+2013> and so far, he<U+2019>s cracked jokes with the sole man in a floristry class full of women and is successfully doing all those things politicians are supposed to do: asking questions, looking engaged, not falling flat on his face. In fact, I<U+2019>d say he<U+2019>s mastered advanced level politicianese: he banters, he maintains eye contact and he has gamely hopped into a mechanical cherry picker with a group of would-be tree surgeons.</p> <p>He<U+2019>s being jerkily hoisted into the upper reaches of a pine tree when I casually ask the deputy director, Malcolm Goodwin, if Boris Johnson has ever visited. <U+201C>Oh he was absolutely brilliant!<U+201D> he says. <U+201C>He was so engaged. I mean he came in like a whirlwind. Do you know the story? Well, we<U+2019>d just had a llama born a couple of days earlier and we ended up calling her Borisa. He just made such an impact on the students.<U+201D></p> <p>Boris, the great prankster, had actually pretended to enrol as a student turning up on the first day of term, Steve Dowbiggin, the principal, says, taking up the story. <U+201C>And then he did about 16,000 selfies. It was very clever. The social media bandwidth he got from that<U+2026> <U+201D> And he shakes his head in disbelieving admiration. </p> <p>There<U+2019>s a slightly tragicomic element to this, with just a hint of <em>The Thick of It</em>, because at this moment, Khan is 50ft in the air, his voice drowned out by the sound of a generator, and not 5ft away is a team of three spin doctors from Labour HQ primed to spring into action to prevent precisely this sort of unhelpful metaphor.</p> <p>If it was Boris in the cherry picker, of course, the mechanism would fail and he<U+2019>d make the front page of the London Evening Standard, whereas Khan is eventually returned to earth without incident and only looks slightly crushed when I tell him about Boris<U+2019>s llama. Who wants to be the politician who doesn<U+2019>t get a llama named after him? Even Ken Livingstone had his newts. </p> <p>But then, I come to think that the biggest obstacle for Khan might simply be that he<U+2019>s life-sized, rather than Boris-sized. He<U+2019>s not that big, flamboyant character we<U+2019>ve come to associate with the job. </p> <p><U+201C>Oh, you<U+2019>re very kind to him,<U+201D> Khan says when I point this out to him later. <U+201C>My biggest criticism of Boris Johnson <U+2013> and I like him by the way, I really do like him <U+2013> is he<U+2019>s giving the impression that mayors can<U+2019>t do much. That the role of the mayor of London is to be entertaining and Boris Johnson is very entertaining. But there<U+2019>s two schools of thought: either a mayor can<U+2019>t do much so you can<U+2019>t fix housing crises and you let the developers do what they like.<U+201D> Or: <U+201C>They can do stuff.<U+201D> He believes <U+201C>mayors can do a huge amount<U+201D>. </p> <p>The big question, however, is that if we are so primed for an old Etonian Tory with a full head of blond hair, what<U+2019>s to stop <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/zac-goldsmith"">Zac Goldsmith </a>slipping seamlessly into the space vacated by Boris? Can Khan, the son of a bus driver who grew up in Tooting in deepest south London, rewrite the script? He was the surprise winner of the Labour party<U+2019>s September election to select a candidate. He came from behind to beat the Blairite favourite, <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tessajowell"">Tessa Jowell</a>. But can he perform the same trick on London in the elections next May? Will we understand who he is and what he stands for to such a degree that he<U+2019>s just <U+201C>Sadiq<U+201D>? As Boris was Boris and Ken was Ken. </p> <p>That he<U+2019>s the son of a bus driver is the one fact I managed to retain about him after catching him on <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b06j6pj8/have-i-got-news-for-you-series-50-episode-3""><em>Have I Got News for You</em></a><em> </em>a week earlier. By the end of it, I discovered he was the son of a bus driver with a sense of humour. But then he needs one. As presenter Sue Perkins pointed out, he was one of the MPs who put Jeremy Corbyn on the leadership ballot but then didn<U+2019>t vote for him.</p> <p><U+201C>I was quite clear that I was going to nominate Jeremy but I wasn<U+2019>t going to vote for him,<U+201D> he says. The plan was to encourage debate within the party. But it does rather give the impression that you<U+2019>re trying to be both pro-Jeremy Corbyn and anti-Jeremy Corbyn simultaneously, I say. <U+201C>The point is I have to be my own person. For people to say, as you<U+2019>re implying <U+2018>You were selected on the coat-tails of Jeremy Corbyn so you should be in thrall to him.<U+2019> That<U+2019>s actually incorrect.<U+201D></p> <p>But then, Khan<U+2019>s greatest strength, I come to think, as well as perhaps his greatest weakness, is his ability to ride two horses at once. He spins this differently, of course. It<U+2019>s his facility for finding compromises, he says, a fact that he points out is due in no small part to growing up in a big family.

So I<U+2019>ve got three older brothers, three younger brothers, and a sister.<U+201D> </p> <p>My God, I say, no wonder you had to make your mark elsewhere. <U+201C>You have to talk fast and you have to eat quickly,<U+201D> he says. And he does. I don<U+2019>t get to see him eat <U+2013> since <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/19/photo-politicians-fear-of-them-eating-cameron-miliband-bacon-sandwich-hot-dog"">Miliband<U+2019>s moment with the bacon sandwich </a>it<U+2019>s unlikely we<U+2019>ll ever get to see a politician eat again <U+2013> but the words pour out of him. <U+201C>It was all about the art of negotiation. I<U+2019>m not the strongest or the tallest or the biggest. It was negotiation and charm.<U+201D> Later, I met his youngest brother, Pop, who tells me that Sadiq<U+2019>s speciality was his <U+201C>Jedi mind tricks<U+201D>. What did that involve?</p> <p><U+201C>It would be him saying, <U+2018>Do you fancy a chocolate?<U+2019> And you<U+2019>d say yes. And he<U+2019>d say <U+2018>When you go to the shop, get us a Toffee Crisp then.<U+2019><U+201D></p> <p>In fact, Khan<U+2019>s family, the story of where he is from, <U+201C>the London story<U+201D>, as he calls it <U+2013> is by far the most compelling thing about him. He has the common touch, he can talk to people, but he<U+2019>s also got all those terrible modern politician traits: boring you into submission, cranking out</p> <p>rehearsed answers, not owning his mistakes. At one point, he actually says <U+201C>I have a big tent<U+201D>, which sounds like Tony Blair by way of <em>Private Eye</em>.</p> <p>But what he has, what no one can take away from him, is his story. He is the thing of which he speaks. He is London, or the London that we surely want, the place where anybody can be anything. The city made him. And it<U+2019>s the key to everything.</p> <p>It<U+2019>s not quite <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/15/100-best-novels-midnights-children-salman-rushdie-""><em>Midnight<U+2019>s Children</em></a>, the Salman Rushdie novel about the generation born on the stroke of midnight as India and Pakistan split in 1947, but there<U+2019>s a mythic quality to the Khan family story. As children his parents lived through the chaos of partition when their families moved first from India to Pakistan and then, in their 20s, emigrated to Britain.</p> <p>They already had three children, all born in Pakistan. But Sadiq, the man who would be mayor, was born in London. It<U+2019>s a novelistic stroke of destiny that he was born here in the city that he wants to lead. (The way I imagine being mayor of London, I tell him, is that it<U+2019>s a bit like being in Alan Sugar<U+2019>s helicopter with the theme tune of <em>The Apprentice </em>blasting out around you looking down on your city. <U+201C>Our city,<U+201D> he corrects me.) He is about as close as you can get to a modern-day Dick Whittington and there is something amazing about how far he has come in a single generation. David Lammy, the MP for Tottenham who stood against Khan, tells me that <U+201C>I can honestly say that what he has achieved in his life so far, coming from where he has, is staggering. He is from a genuinely immigrant, working-class place and London electing its first Muslim mayor would be an extraordinary global story and a huge tribute to the spirit of multicultural London.</p> <p><U+201C>But then he has worked really, really hard. Phenomenally hard. I honestly wonder when he sleeps. And he gets into the detail. He really, really puts the effort in and does not cut corners. He shouldn<U+2019>t be underestimated.<U+201D></p> <p>What<U+2019>s marked him out, another insider tells me, is the way he has mastered the machinery of the Labour party. <U+201C>He<U+2019>s very skilfully figured out all the elements. He understands Labour HQ and how that works. He got the unions on board. He got the party<U+2019>s elder statesmen to endorse him.<U+201D></p> <p>And though he benefited from the Corbyn surge, Khan points out that he also helped it. He didn<U+2019>t concentrate just on existing members of the party, he went out and registered new voters. <U+201C>I spent three months <U+2013> I took one day off <U+2013> going to bus garages, shopping centres, factories, synagogues. Before Corbynmania happened, we were getting people signed up. That<U+2019>s what makes it exciting. You<U+2019>re meeting young people who think we<U+2019>re all the same. We<U+2019>re all corrupt. We<U+2019>re all posh. We all went to Oxbridge. We all speak funny. When they meet you and hear your story, there are people who say, <U+2018>If you can do it, then I should try and help you.<U+2019> That<U+2019>s what is exciting.<U+201D></p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""d9581e077688cd4db19610b2819a9bb0118ffa70""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/d9581e077688cd4db19610b2819a9bb0118ffa70/195_265_2966_1779/1000.jpg"" alt=""Khan, is congratulated by his wife Saadiya after winning the contest to become Labour<U+2019>s candidate for mayor of London."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Khan is congratulated by his wife Saadiya after winning the contest to become Labour<U+2019>s candidate for mayor of London.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is what I come to think of as his <U+201C>total warfare<U+201D> approach. Khan doesn<U+2019>t do anything by halves. I ask a friend of mine, on the right of the party, who she voted for, though I know it will be Tessa Jowell, and she surprises me by telling it was Khan. <U+201C>He turned up on my doorstep,<U+201D> she says. <U+201C>None of the other candidates did that. And I was just impressed, his family background, the fact that he<U+2019>d had a proper job.<U+201D> And then she was dogged by phone calls from his team. <U+201C>It was quite annoying but I figured he must be able to inspire people to work for him.<U+201D></p> <p>And, most importantly, he has a track record of winning. A senior Labour MP points out to me that he<U+2019>s always been an underdog. And he<U+2019>s always won.</p> <p><U+201C>He has the ability to come out fighting. So if you look at it, he supported Ed Miliband for the leadership when the favourite was David. He was the one who organised his campaign and he won. And this time around, he was the head of Labour<U+2019>s campaign in London. And London was the only place where Labour actually increased the vote. And he did the same thing with the mayoral candidacy. He was far from the favourite and yet he won. He has this amazing ability to organise and he throws everything at it.<U+201D></p> <p>But then, it<U+2019>s not hard to find reasons for this in his background. He<U+2019>s never been handed anything on a silver platter. Amol Rajan, the editor of the <em>Independent,</em> who also grew up in Tooting, points out that Khan didn<U+2019>t just go to a bog standard comprehensive in Tooting: he went to what was then the worst comprehensive in Tooting. Among parents it was <U+201C>the dreaded second choice: Ernest Bevin school<U+2026> the staple of local news reports about drugs, gangs and local hoodlums.<U+201D></p> <p>And if you want to put to bed some of the myths about benefit-seeking scroungers flooding here from abroad, Khan<U+2019>s family are as good as any place to look. From a council estate in south London, they managed to work hard enough to buy their own home and send all eight children to university.</p> <p>The day before I<U+2019>m due to meet Khan, his communications director <U+2013> a role more popularly known as a <U+201C>spin doctor<U+201D> <U+2013> the highly experienced ex-political editor Paddy Hennessy, rings me to tell me that Khan is going to tell me about his mother. Great, I think. A hot scoop. I<U+2019>ve read about this. It<U+2019>s never happened to me but dropping an exclusive in the lap of favoured journalists is the bread and butter of political reporting. Unfortunately, the exclusive seems to be that he has a mother.</p> <p>I rather suspect that they<U+2019>ve decided that since I<U+2019>m a lady journalist, they<U+2019>ll try and focus on lady-friendly issues and tailor the answers toward a key demographic of undecided females (according to the polls, 51% of women as opposed to 36% of men have yet to make up their minds). But then, nothing happens by chance in modern politics. We<U+2019>re in Enfield because the outer suburbs are a key target and Paddy is there in the room with us with his own Dictaphone making his own recording of the interview <U+2013> something that<U+2019>s only happened to me once before <U+2013> and there<U+2019>s a terrible moment when Khan attempts to drop an article I wrote casually into conversation. (It<U+2019>s the one article I<U+2019>ve written that cites him by name, as I<U+2019>m sure a quick Google search by a helpful aide would have uncovered.)</p> <p>Later, he<U+2019>ll tell me about the <U+201C>control freakery<U+201D> of New Labour, the way that all debate was stifled within the party during the years it was in power, but the dark art of political messaging is one of the reasons that people responded so enthusiastically to the unspun Corbyn. And there<U+2019>s more than a sniff of focus groups coming off some of his policies. But then one well-placed political insider tells me the battle is not going to be <U+201C>Sadiq versus Zac. It<U+2019>s going to be Sadiq versus <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/lynton-crosby"">Lynton Crosby</a><U+201D> <U+2013> the rather brilliant Australian electoral strategist, the so-called <U+201C>Wizard of Oz<U+201D> who helped Boris Johnson to victory, masterminded the Conservative general election campaign this year, and who has been hired to advise the Goldsmith campaign.</p> <p>And, in fairness, I enjoy hearing about his mother. <U+201C>She had to quit school when she was 15. She had no qualifications. She went to a foreign country, knowing nobody. We had no relations here so it was pretty tough on her.<U+201D> Sometimes even Khan, it seems, has trouble keeping track of his siblings. <U+201C>She raised seven kids in a council estate with three bedrooms,<U+201D> he says. <U+201C>Eight kids, sorry, eight kids including me, in a three-bedroom council flat. At the same time, she was doing piecework. Do you know what piecework is? A bloke comes around with 50 dresses, you get 25p a dress. You saw her at the machine all the time just sewing the dresses. She did the piecework in the corner, cooked and fed the family, all of us together, all while my dad was out working all the hours God sends you, overtime and stuff.<U+201D></p> <p>All the siblings still live in spitting distance of each other, he says, and she<U+2019>s the matriarch. <U+201C>We call her Don Corleone.<U+201D></p> <p>What? There<U+2019>s a horse<U+2019>s head under your pillow if you don<U+2019>t toe the line?</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""1b59366b253c8eb8380568c6fa7565f90f7e5600""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/1b59366b253c8eb8380568c6fa7565f90f7e5600/0_64_1849_1110/1000.jpg"" alt=""Political heavyweight: Khan speaking in the Commons last year."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Political heavyweight: Khan speaking in the Commons last year.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><U+201C>She<U+2019>s not scared to raise her voice. It doesn<U+2019>t matter who you are. You could have made the most rocking speech in parliament and you go to your mum<U+2019>s house and she<U+2019>ll tear you up for not having visited her for a week or not putting the rubbish out or whatever.<U+201D></p> <p>Housing is the No 1 priority for Khan<U+2019>s campaign. But then, I<U+2019>ve also heard Zac Goldsmith say it<U+2019>s the No 1 priority for his campaign too. It<U+2019>s still early days, but they<U+2019>re neck and neck at the moment. The latest YouGov poll has Goldsmith on 28%, Khan on 29%. But then when it comes to the headlines, they have a habit of saying similar things. Yes, to pedestrianising Oxford Street. Yes to Crossrail 2. No to Heathrow<U+2019>s third runway. But housing is the big issue. The social mobility that Khan<U+2019>s family enjoyed turned out to be a brief postwar blip. And, for millions of people, a whole generation, the capital isn<U+2019>t the place where you can build a career, a life, a family. It<U+2019>s a money trap from which there<U+2019>s no escape.</p> <p>It<U+2019>s Sunday morning and I go to meet Khan in the boxing club in Earlsfield, south London, that he went to as a boy. It<U+2019>s still a family affair. There<U+2019>s Pop, his younger brother, who<U+2019>s a coach, and his nephew, David, another coach, who are both there helping with the training of a roomful of adolescent boys. His oldest brother runs the place on a voluntary basis <U+2013> he has his own business <U+2013> though he<U+2019>s not around and there<U+2019>s another nephew in photos on the wall who fights competitively.</p> <p>They all volunteer their time. Pop <U+2013> it<U+2019>s a nickname <U+2013> designs medical devices for the NHS and tells me that his first experience of community work was when Sadiq became a councillor. <U+201C>We all had Saturday jobs but it wasn<U+2019>t like that because you don<U+2019>t get paid. He was doing it for the sake of doing it. It was my first experience of people volunteering, but now we all do it.<U+201D></p> <p>The council estate they grew up on is just around the corner and Khan points out the No 44 bus that runs up and down the road outside; that was his dad<U+2019>s old route. He died a few years back, and Earlsfield and nearby Tooting where the family moved to are, like most places in London, in the throes of gentrification. <U+201C>In those days, the No 44 bus driver could live on the council estate with subsidised rent and the kids would go to the local schools. Nowadays, I bet the 44 bus driver doesn<U+2019>t even live in London. He probably commutes in and lives in private rented accommodation. It<U+2019>s a very different world, London, now.<U+201D></p> <p>It<U+2019>s taken a decade for housing to make its way up the political agenda and all politicians have learned to say vaguely the right things about it, even if almost nothing has been done about it, and while I<U+2019>m not convinced by all of Khan<U+2019>s housing policies <U+2013> he goes on about a London-wide, not-for-profit letting agency without explaining why landlords would sign up for it rather than, say, with Foxtons <U+2013> but I am convinced that he understands the issues.</p> <p>He recognises his incredible good fortune. And he<U+2019>s surrounded by family members who had the bad luck to be born just a bit too late. He has two daughters, Anisah, 16, and Ammarah, 14 <U+2013> he and his wife, Saadiya , who, like him, is a human rights lawyer, were teenage sweethearts <U+2013> but he has nieces and nephews who are older, nearly all of whom are still living at home.</p> <p><U+201C>My nephew, who<U+2019>s downstairs, lives with his mum and dad in Streatham. He<U+2019>s 32. My niece who got married two years ago and is expecting her first child, she lives with her mum and dad. My niece who<U+2019>s a junior doctor, as is her husband, they<U+2019>re renting in Eltham. They<U+2019>d love to buy but they can<U+2019>t.

But there<U+2019>s no chance the grandchildren will be able to stay in the area. They<U+2019>re moving further and further away.<U+201D></p> <p>The most alarming new demographic in London is the number of children living in poverty in privately rented homes, a quarter of a million of them, rising to an estimated million in 10 years. They<U+2019>ll be forced to move five, six, maybe more times in their childhoods, to move schools, and, as a leading academic on inequality tells me before my interview with Khan, they<U+2019>re the ones who need help most. And, actually, some of the suggestions he offers are ones that Khan is pursuing: three-year tenancies, and, most crucially, trying to find a means to control rents.</p> <p><U+201C>I want the government to give me the same powers that Berlin has got, that other places around the world have, for rent control,<U+201D> says Khan. But how are you actually going to do that? <U+201C>Lobbying the government. If the government is giving power to Scotland and Wales and Manchester, they should be giving powers to London as well.<U+201D> If it<U+2019>d actually happen, though, is another thing entirely.</p> <p>He<U+2019>s working out on a punch bag when I arrive at the boxing club, though he<U+2019>s honest enough to say it<U+2019>s because his brothers would have taken the piss out of him if he<U+2019>d turned up and just used the place as a location for the interview. Still, he knows how to throw a punch. What<U+2019>s boxing taught him in terms of how to approach an opponent?</p> <p>He launches into a disquisition on how he also played football and cricket and the things children learn being a team player that<U+2019>s so platitudinous and dull that I interrupt him. Isn<U+2019>t boxing about sizing up your opponent and figuring out their weak spots?</p> <p>He blusters a bit but eventually, he says: <U+201C>Boxing is all about defence. You make sure your face is covered. Some people say that if Crosby is involved, there<U+2019>ll be lots of attacks on me. The obvious boxing metaphor is to make sure you can defend yourself.

A poll conducted on behalf of the radio station LBC found that a third of Londoners were <U+201C>uncomfortable<U+201D> with the idea of a Muslim man as mayor. What did you make of that? <U+201C>I<U+2019>ve spoken to LBC about it. It was a very leading question. It wasn<U+2019>t framed the way the way polling experts say it should have been. Even LBC accept that now.<U+201D></p> <p>What did you think when you saw it? <U+201C>There were four members of my campaign team that are of Islamic faith. Two of them were in tears when they saw that. It was thoroughly demoralising for lots of people. It was very upsetting. I<U+2019>ve realised that there are people who, through no fault of their own, have never met a Muslim or broken bread with a Muslim and some of them prejudge. The more they meet us or mix with us, they realise that we are very similar to them and there<U+2019>s nothing to be scared of.<U+201D></p> <p>It is depressing. Khan tells me he supports Liverpool FC because his brothers got chased out of Chelsea by the National Front, <U+201C>so my experience of watching football was watching on TV<U+201D>. And there<U+2019>s a rumour that a newspaper has dispatched a team to Pakistan to try and dig up something to link his family to terrorism and his past as a human rights lawyer is sure to be raked over <U+2013> he represented a number of people who were accused of terror offences. In 2008, he was <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/feb/21/terrorism.uksecurity"">bugged while visiting a constituent in prison</a> <U+2013> a constituent, <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/uk/babar-ahmad"">Babar Ahmad</a>, who was later convicted of extremist crimes.</p> <p>It<U+2019>s no wonder Khan<U+2019>s learned to keep his fists close to his face. Goldsmith<U+2019>s story lacks the epic qualities of his own (is born, goes to Eton, inherits <U+00A3>300m, gets a job editing a magazine his uncle owns, stands for parliament) and Khan makes the most of the fact that he was a successful businessman before he became an MP. It was while studying law in Guildford, he says, that he met <U+201C>the Oxbridge lot<U+201D>. What did you make of them? <U+201C>It made me realise I was as clever as them.<U+201D> Was that a sort of epiphany for you?</p> <p><U+201C>I was never worried about my own abilities,<U+201D> he says. I can believe this. But then he has the self-made man<U+2019>s confidence. He could have joined <U+201C>one of the magic circle firms<U+201D> <U+2013> a big City law firm <U+2013> but instead he joined Christian Fisher, which specialised in human rights. There he was mentored by one of the partners, Louise Christian, and when the other partner, Mike Fisher, retired, he became a partner and the company was renamed Christian Khan.</p> <p>But when he was selected as a parliamentary candidate for Tooting, he walked away. And it<U+2019>s here that the story gets confusing. The firm had 50 employees and was worth several million pounds, but he left with nothing. Christian felt let down, he admits. She<U+2019>d been his mentor and he just walked away. And Khan felt he should have had some of the firm<U+2019>s value. His lawyer told him to litigate. He refused and the net result was that he walked away with nothing.</p> <p><U+201C>Friends have said it was a foolish thing to do,<U+201D> he admits. <U+201C>But I didn<U+2019>t want to be a politician or a candidate where I<U+2019>m not all in.<U+201D></p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""a8b70b5bf36236ed7c2ddeed4fc198cde1318117""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/a8b70b5bf36236ed7c2ddeed4fc198cde1318117/0_180_2992_1796/1000.jpg"" alt=""Khan, the son of a bus driver, can make much of his working class roots, unlike his Eton-educated Tory opponent."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Khan, the son of a bus driver, can make much of his working-class roots, unlike his Eton-educated Tory opponent.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It<U+2019>s not to be underestimated, though, walking away from several million pounds. And I talk him through it several times, trying to work out the chronology of the events. He thought he<U+2019>d leave with some sort of payout, he admits, but in the end, it was his choice not to pursue it. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s never been about the money,<U+201D> he says. And, I think, you have to believe him. He could be a rich man if he wanted to be.</p> <p>For six months, he had no salary and by the time he was elected, he<U+2019>d run through his savings. And then he started all over again, at the bottom, as a backbench MP. He was, he still is, hungry. You can taste it. And it shows in the shrewdness of his moves so far <U+2013> after he helped Miliband campaign, he was handed the shadow brief for London which gave him a huge advantage in the mayoral selection <U+2013> and he<U+2019>s never been afraid to change his mind. Or flip-flop, as I put it, most spectacularly on the subject of Heathrow<U+2019>s third runway, which he supported as transport minister, but then turned against this year.</p> <p><U+201C>There<U+2019>s an argument for increased flight capacity. I<U+2019>ve accepted the argument. My point is, when there<U+2019>s an alternative which is less of a problem <U+2013> the air quality in Surrey and Sussex is not as bad as in London, the noise problem isn<U+2019>t as bad.<U+201D></p> <p>And there are also fewer people who can vote for you there, I point out.</p> <p>He claims that he changed his mind because the facts changed and illness caused by air pollution is now a top priority. But I email Professor Frank Kelly, head of the environmental research group at King<U+2019>s College, London, who<U+2019>s a leading authority on the subject, and he says that while Gatwick is a better option than Heathrow, it<U+2019>s also <U+201C>not the most pressing issue<U+201D> when it comes to cleaning up London<U+2019>s air. Diesel buses and taxis are a bigger problem.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""c575aa1ab890b12b5bd6a8e7fd11a9ee4ae65468""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/c575aa1ab890b12b5bd6a8e7fd11a9ee4ae65468/252_1098_5341_3205/1000.jpg"" alt=""Mayoral candidates Zac Goldsmith and Sadiq Khan attend a rally against a third runway at Heathrow airport."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Mayoral candidates Zac Goldsmith and Sadiq Khan attend a rally against a third runway at Heathrow airport.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Chris Ratcliffe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I suspect that the thing with Khan is that he just wants to win.

But the brand of political comedy embodied by Jon Stewart <U+2013> and drawn on heavily by Youssef <U+2013> is not without its critics.</p> <p>Steve Almond <a href=""http://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-jokes-on-you"">wrote in the Baffler</a> in 2012 that Stewart<U+2019>s schtick was evidence of an audience <U+201C>gone to lard morally<U+201D>, and a betrayal of comedy<U+2019>s radical impulses. He argued Stewart<U+2019>s nightly mockery of the war in <U+201C>Mess O<U+2019>Potamia<U+201D> made a sitcom of Bush<U+2019>s misadventures, acting as a pressure valve for frustrated Americans, who might otherwise have taken action.</p> <p><U+201C>Why take to the streets when Stewart and [Stephen] Colbert are on the case? It<U+2019>s a lot easier, and more fun, to experience the war as a passive form of entertainment than as a source of moral distress requiring citizen activism,<U+201D> Almond wrote.</p> <p>Youssef<U+2019>s blue eyes flash at this suggestion. <U+201C>At least Colbert and Stewart have done their part. They<U+2019>ve shown the defects, they<U+2019>ve made fun, shown you what<U+2019>s really going on.</p> <p><U+201C>The fact people don<U+2019>t then go out, it<U+2019>s really not [Stewart<U+2019>s] fault. This is too much pressure, too much burden on the satirist. He has a job, a timeslot, and he explains it to people in his way, and it<U+2019>s up to the people to do it. The fact that the people didn<U+2019>t do it, you need to blame the people,<U+201D> he says.</p> <p>It<U+2019>s a quietly rumbling fault line between high profile political satirists and their audiences, who can look to the comedians for answers, or to lead.

Why such a proliferation of assassination plots from well-known writers? Perhaps anyone who spends his or her days building stories, forming a web of events, deciding who within that web may live and may not, is inclined sometimes to try and imagine what it must be like to hatch a real-world plot on an awful scale <U+2013> one that might change the course of history. What would it be like to be Lee Harvey Oswald, holding a whole nation<U+2019>s narrative in your hands?</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/16/high-dive-jonathan-lee-review"">High Dive by Jonathan Lee review <U+2013> an atmospheric tale of the 80s</a> </p> </aside>  <p> In Don DeLillo<U+2019>s Libra, his novel about the assassination of John F Kennedy, he writes that <U+201C>the purpose of history is to climb out of your own skin<U+201D>. To my mind that<U+2019>s the purpose of fiction, too. It takes us to uncomfortable places, shows us people who are not like us, introduces questions we might rather not confront. I love these 10 works of fiction for their ability to push us so deeply into the lives of others.</p> <h2>1. <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/10/brief-history-of-seven-killings-marlon-james-review"">A Brief History Of Seven Killings by Marlon James</a></h2> <p>The playfulness of this novel is announced by its title: James<U+2019>s book is not brief, is not a work of history and encompasses many more killings than seven. It<U+2019>s a wonderfully bold blend of experience and imagination, fiction and fact, centring on <a draggable=""true"" href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/16/urban.worldmusic"">the attempted assassination of Bob Marley</a> in 1976. James focuses on drawing the reader into a mass of ghostly voices surrounding <U+201C>The Singer<U+201D>: CIA operatives, groupies, journalists. <U+201C>The dead never stop talking,<U+201D> he writes, <U+201C>and the living sometimes hear.<U+201D> The judges of the Man Booker prize heard, and <a draggable=""true"" href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/13/marlon-james-is-an-uncompromising-and-exhilarating-man-booker-winner"">made this a worthy winner last month</a>.</p> <h2>2. <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/24/fiction.dondelillo"">Libra by Don DeLillo</a></h2> <p>DeLillo gives us various versions of Lee Harvey Oswald: high-school dropout in New Orleans, disaffected marine in Japan, administrative employee at the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas. At all times Oswald is struggling to overcome his severe dyslexia, a battle that foreshadows a CIA archivist<U+2019>s later attempts to make sense of thousands of pages of evidence.</p> <h2>3. <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/24/the-assassination-of-margaret-thatcher-review-hilary-mantel-collection-short-stories"">The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher by Hilary Mantel</a></h2> <p>I broke out in a cold sweat in 2014 when I saw it announced that Hilary Mantel was releasing a book with this title. I assumed she was writing about the same subject matter I<U+2019>d been labouring away at for years. Instead, the piece that gives Mantel<U+2019>s story collection its title is a fever dream in which a sniper invades a Windsor home with the intention of shooting the PM. Thatcher is recovering from eye surgery, wearing <U+201C>big goggle glasses<U+201D> in an attempt to shade herself from <U+201C>the trials of the afternoon<U+201D>, but even a world leader wrapped up in her own well-practised detachment is not safe, in Mantel<U+2019>s coolly brilliant prose, from the unsettling effects of events.</p> <h2>4. <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/29/lazarus-project-aleksandar-hermon-review"">The Lazarus Project by Aleksandar Hemon</a></h2> <p>On a March day in 1908, a young Jewish immigrant named Lazarus Averbuch was shot dead by George Shippy, Chicago<U+2019>s chief of police. It was claimed that Averbuch was an anarchist assassin sent to kill him. Hemon boldly pushes himself into the many gaps in this official account of events, imagining what the reality might have been.</p> <h2>5. <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/16/hhhh-laurent-binet-review"">HHhH by Laurent Binet, translated by Sam Taylor</a></h2> <p>A side-benefit of the success of this book was hearing people at London publishing parties saying, glasses of tepid white wine in hand, <U+201C>No no, it<U+2019>s called <em tabindex=""-1"">haitch haitch haitch haitch</em><U+201D>, and then debating which letter was lower case.

It explores the mysterious death of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, president of Pakistan from 1978 to 1988, in a plane crash that has been variously blamed on Zia<U+2019>s power-hungry colleagues, the CIA, the KGB, Mossad and Indian secret agents. In the tradition of all great shaggy-dog stories, Hanif throws into the mix a few more potential sources of blame, including a clew of tapeworms and a mango-eating bird.</p> <h2>7. <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/07/jhumpa-lahiri-the-lowland-review"">The Lowland by Jhumpa Lahiri</a></h2> <p>Exploring the enduring impact of the Naxalite movement on one family, Lahiri<U+2019>s plot moves between two linked killings: the assassination of a policeman and the eventual execution of the man to blame. The threat of extinction is everywhere in the book. Even the smallest mammals in the lowland can be found <U+201C>burying themselves in mud, simulating death, waiting for the return of rain<U+201D>.</p> <h2>8. <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/28/bernard-maclaverty-interview"">Cal by Bernard MacLaverty</a></h2> <p>MacLaverty<U+2019>s magnificent story of life during the Troubles has at its heart the moment when Cal, a young Catholic caught up with the IRA, assists in the assassination of a reserve police officer. He is told by men well-practised in violence that it is crucial to <U+201C>think of the issues, not the people<U+201D>, but the novel is a brilliant demonstration of the impossibility of divorcing ideas from their human repercussions.</p> <h2>9. <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/apr/06/fiction.reviews"">The Feast of the Goat by Mario Vargas Llosa, translated by Edith Grossman</a></h2> <p>Published in English in 2001, nine years before Vargas Llosa was awarded the Nobel prize, the novel dramatises the assassination of former Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo, known by some citizens as <U+201C>the Goat<U+201D>. Moving between the assassination itself and its effect on the country several decades later, The Feast of the Goat, with a narrative structure flexible enough to show the links between past and present, exposes a whole system of political corruption without ever quite tipping over into didacticism.</p> <h2>10. <a href=""https://bookshop.theguardian.com/man-with-the-golden-gun.html"">The Man With the Golden Gun by Ian Fleming</a></h2> <p>No list of assassination plots would be complete without a little 007. The writing in The Man With the Golden Gun may not be as compelling as it is in some of Fleming<U+2019>s other novels, but the story is desperately addictive. Bond is sent to Jamaica to kill a Cuban assassin called Scaramanga, a character apparently named after a hated contemporary of Fleming<U+2019>s at Eton. With a schoolboy<U+2019>s taste for entertainment, Fleming takes his revenge with a few strokes of ink.</p> <ul> <li>High Dive by Jonathan Lee is published by William Heinemann, priced <U+00A3>16.99, and is <a href=""https://bookshop.theguardian.com/index.php/catalog/product/view/id/293722/"">available from the Guardian bookshop for <U+00A3>13.59</a>.</li> </ul>"

Sardar upheld the view that it is the combination of faith and reason that offers a fuller understanding of the world, maintaining that it was this worldview that enabled the development of science in the <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/30/religion.world"">Islamic golden Age</a>.</p> <p>A practising Muslim, Sardar is on an independent mission to promote rational, considered thought in interpreting the Qur<U+2019>an. He explained that when he came to the UK from Pakistan, he found comfort in the familiar language of mathematics, which set him on a trajectory to train as a physicist: <U+201C>God doesn<U+2019>t need me, I need him. It makes me a better person and a better scientist<U+201D>, he said.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2008/feb/04/scienceweeklyforfebruary04"">Science Weekly for February 4: Through the looking glass</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He described the way in which, as a child, his dissatisfaction with rudimentary religious guidance at home instilled a strong urge for self-enquiry: <U+201C>Science forces you to ask questions. The more you think, the [fewer] answers you find<U+201D>.</p> <p>Sardar asserted that religion and reason are two sides of the same coin and feels that conflict between the two is deliberately manufactured. He argued that problems arisewhen Muslims adopt a narrow, reductionist interpretation regarding the holistic concept of <em>ilm</em> <U+2013> whereas in fact there are many facets to knowledge.</p> <p></p> <p>In Sardar<U+2019>s view, the Qur<U+2019>an is much more sophisticated than a simple rulebook: <U+201C>it is the beginning of the adventure, not the end.<U+201D> He also believes in the value of perpetual interpretation: <U+201C>God is not an accountant. He didn<U+2019>t give us everything on plate and leave with us with nothing to do. He created us with the agency and freedom to think. God likes a good argument. He doesn<U+2019>t give full answers, things have been deliberately left hanging for us to explore further.<U+201D></p> <p>In short, Sardar<U+2019>s view is that although human knowledge at times converges with the Qur<U+2019>an, the text should certainly not be treated as a scientific encyclopaedia. In support of this view, Sardar lamented the emergence of the I<U+2019>jaz movement, which insists the Qur<U+2019>an contains descriptions of modern scientific phenomena ranging from quantum mechanics to accurate descriptions of the stages of embryology and geology. In Sardar<U+2019>s opinion, this stems from insecurity and a personal need to vindicate Islam to others.</p> <p>Jim Al-Khalili agreed that ascribing literal meanings to religious texts can be perilous and that these verses should be interpreted more metaphorically. Likewise, when Einstein famously said <U+201C>God does not play dice<U+201D> he was using a figure of speech to acknowledge that there are things we don<U+2019>t yet understand but this shouldn<U+2019>t stop us from trying to find out more.</p> <p>Whilst Al-Khalili is a staunch atheist, he adopts what he describes as an <U+201C>accommodationist<U+201D> approach in his interactions with people of religious faith: <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t think people who believe in God are irrational, I just don<U+2019>t see a need to believe there is a purpose for why things are the way they are.<U+201D> Born in Bagdad, Al-Khalili grew up in Iraq. His mother was Christian and his father was Shia, but he never heard them quarrel about religion. By the time he reached his teens he felt that he had distanced himself from needing any form of spirituality and his subsequent scientific training cemented this worldview. He asserted that his core values are empathy, humility and respect, without being driven by a reward in an afterlife: <U+201C>It<U+2019>s not just people of religious faith that have a moral compass <U+2013> morality is what makes us human.<U+201D></p> <p>Al-Khalili is a prolific advocate of the Islamic golden age of science: he has authored a <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/23/arabic-science-jim-alkhalili-review"">book on the topic </a>and has just finished presenting a new TV series about it on Al-Jazeera. Although Al-Khalili questioned if some of the major scholars were culturally religious rather than devout followers, he acknowledges the clear interconnection between faith and science during the medieval period. In support of this he cited Simon Schaffer<U+2019>s thesis on the subject: once a belief in a single God was established there was an impetus to understand the nature of his creation and discover how things work using the brains He equipped us with. For instance, as the Islamic empire expanded to other lands, Muslims in these new territories were required to know the direction of Mecca for prayer, which led to leaps in map-making and trigonometry, along with a better understanding of geography. The need to establish the schedule for daily prayers, and to forecast the precise timings of sunset and sunrise for fasting during Ramadan, spurred major advances in astronomy by perfecting instruments such as the astrolabe. The importance of cleanliness, coupled with the urge to heal the sick, were incentives for major advances in medicine.</p> <p><U+201C>So why we have forgotten the vast contributions of Islamic scientists and thinkers?<U+201D>, Al-Khalili pondered. Whilst we champion the work of Galileo, Kepler and Newton we still need reminding about earlier influencers such as <a href=""http://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Biruni"">Al-Biruni</a>, Al-Tusi and Ibn Al-Shatir who had an impact on the work of Copernicus. Similarly, Ibn al-Haytham articulated the scientific method long before Descartes, Al-Khalili emphasised.</p> <p>Whilst Al-Khalili confessed that science could be regarded as a form of ideology, he argues science is substantiated through the mechanisms of experimentation and reproducibility rather than relying on <U+201C>blind faith<U+201D>. Whilst individual scientists may carry personal bias, dogma or have vested interests, the process of science itself is self-correcting. He admitted this isn<U+2019>t always the case when it comes to daily practice. For example, string theory is still a mathematical game rather than a bona fide theory as we don<U+2019>t yet have a testable way to verify it. In his opinion, we should keep searching for answers <U+2013> it is intellectually lazy to not investigate further.</p> <p>And what if science proves religious dogma to be incorrect? The heliocentric theory and understanding of evolution have already made previous concepts about the world redundant. <U+201C>If science conclusively proves something to be true then the preceding religious dogma would have to change<U+201D>, Sardar conceded .<U+201C>But the point is, science doesn<U+2019>t necessarily come up with final answers. Much like religion, science is open to constant revision and reinterpretation<U+201D>, he argued.</p> <p>Sardar is alarmed by non-rational Islamists advocating worldviews that go against the grain of science. <U+201C>I find the dawn of creationism in the Muslim world astonishing: historically Muslims were never creationists,<U+201D> he lamented, referring to the work of Al-Jahiz and Ibn Tufail who wrote extensively on spontaneous generation and pre-Darwinian concepts.</p> <p>Sardar presented the notion that the early Muslim community had enough self-conviction to co-exist successfully in a plural society, but that over time this self-confidence became eroded as a more rigid form of Islam took hold. <U+201C>Dogmatic people dislike uncertainty<U+201D> observed Sardar, who further suggested that the outlawing of <em>ijtihad</em> (critical reasoning) spelt the end of Islam<U+2019>s Golden Age. Al-Ghazali was portrayed as the main party-pooper: he launched a devastating attack on Aristotelian rationalism following a personal crisis of faith. Ironically, this came after being upheld as the beacon of philosophical thought in his earlier years. Caliphs who were initially great patrons of scholarship gradually became increasingly conservative and closed their gates to free thinkers.</p> <p>As Sardar described it, the final nail in the coffin was falling into clutches of western colonialism. This was enabled by European seafaring nations who discovered new territories in 1492 CE and thereby secured unlimited access to human and mineral resources. This provided the cash flow to fund scientific research back home in Europe. Whilst Al-Khalili suggested that having a spirit of adventure and engaging in quests to uncover the unknown could be seen as virtues, Sardar was unconvinced, and argued that the values of western Enlightenment had disastrous effects for the people in the <U+201C>New World<U+201D>, who were not encountered with mutual respect: <U+201C>We must not forget that most philosophers of the Enlightenment were deeply racist and perceived alien cultures, including Islam, as inferior.<U+201D></p> <p>Historians currently conclude the Islamic golden age of science began to decline during the 12th Century but this stance ignores the major contributions made during the Ottoman Empire up until the 14th Century. In Sardar<U+2019>s opinion, Ibn Khaldun was the last great scholar of the age; he died in 1406 CE.</p> <p>But what is the state of contemporary science in the Islamic world today? Al-Khalili acknowledged we need to be concerned about the rise of anti-scientism in certain parts of the world. Whilst some are suspicious of science as a form of authority, there is also a universal race to be world-class leaders in science and innovation. However, Sardar believes such initiatives in the Arabian Peninsula rely on imported labour and imitate research already happening in the west. On highlighting developments in the Gulf in particular, Sardar warned that having <U+201C>money and no brains<U+201D> is a dangerous combination: it<U+2019>s easy to order new buildings and research labs, but unless these are accompanied by a sustained spirit of rational enquiry this kind of movement is vulnerable to crumble.</p> <p>Sardar sees himself as part of a vehicle trying to recreate rational discourse in Islam. Through hosting fellowship programmes and publishing the Critical Muslim journal via the Muslim Institute he founded, Sardar is endeavouring to cultivate a critical mass of freethinkers who can influence positive change. While this may be feasible in Britain, it<U+2019>s much harder for those living in Muslim nations today to ask intelligent questions without major repercussions. Al-Khalili hopes to see debates on evolution happening in the Middle East, which would signal a genuine rekindling of rational thought. A previous debate on evolution in the UK did generate some groundbreaking discussion, but this initiative has not been sustained on the same scale.</p> <p>Rather than indulging in adversarial polemics, the event succeeded in facilitating lively yet complex dialogue to a riveted audience of 400 Humanists and Muslims. During the three years of Al-Khalili<U+2019>s presidency of the BHA, he has proved himself to be an effective agent of intercultural dialogue. I hope the next president will continue on this track.</p> <p><em>Yasmin Khan is the producer of Sindbad Sci-Fi.

I was used to seeing them every day. We<U+2019>d brought them up from babies. I went into a massive depression.<U+201D></p> <p>Desperate to see his children again, Painter began court proceedings. It was then he learned he would have to pay for his own lawyer. Since the removal of legal aid for virtually all family cases in April 2013, the state will not provide him <U+2013> or indeed anyone except domestic abuse victims, in limited circumstances <U+2013> with free legal advice or representation. Painter<U+2019>s partner, Emma, took out a non-molestation order against him soon after she left, a move he believes was designed to ensure she was eligible for a state-funded lawyer. <U+201C>She<U+2019>s exaggerated and lied, and she<U+2019>s done it to get legal aid,<U+201D> he says.</p> <p>Painter has no choice but to attend court as a <U+201C>litigant in person<U+201D>. He can<U+2019>t afford to pay the hundreds, possibly thousands, of pounds that legal advice, letters and expert representation at hearings would cost. What money he can scrape together, he<U+2019>d rather spend on the 350-mile round trip he now makes fortnightly to see his children.</p> <p>We first met in May, at Bristol<U+2019>s Civil and Family Justice Centre, when Painter had been called to his first hearing, with only four days<U+2019> notice to prepare. He had travelled from the north-east the night before. He was just about holding it together, but was clearly very anxious. Standing outside the courtroom in this bright, modern legal centre, he came across as a man in shock, poleaxed by the allegations of domestic abuse, furious that his children had been taken hundreds of miles away from what had been their family home, but also frightened about what the court would say about his right to see them in the future.</p> <p>Smartly dressed in a dark suit, he had brought his mother and sister with him for support. They talked quietly among themselves, but it was clear the whole family was upset, angry and tense. As Painter<U+2019>s ex and her lawyer walked past, everyone carefully avoided eye contact. Leafing anxiously through a folder thick with court documentation and witness statements, Painter said he wanted his children returned to his care so they could go back to their old school and the home in which they had grown up.</p> <p>At both this first hearing and a second in July, I went into court to observe. Family cases are heard in private: journalists have the right to attend, but not to report any detail of what is said before the judge. I was able, however, to witness the extreme stress these individuals find themselves placed under.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Standing outside the courtroom, he came across as a man in shock, furious, but also frightened about the future</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Every element of Painter<U+2019>s case and how it would be managed was set out with painstaking care by District Judge Watson, so as not to disadvantage the man appearing in person before him. But despite the deliberate, calm and ordered tone set by the judge, the tension soared as an emotionally charged negotiation took place between Painter, his ex and her lawyer. With nobody to represent him, Painter had not only to think on his feet, but also try to express himself as calmly as he could, given the high stakes.</p> <p>Although there isn<U+2019>t typically much complex law to get to grips with in private family cases, litigants in person often arrive at court in a state of heightened emotion, says family barrister Lucy Reed, author of <a href=""https://bookshop.theguardian.com/family-court-without-a-lawyer.html"">The Family Court Without A Lawyer</a>: A Handbook For Litigants In Person. They have nobody with expert knowledge of the relevant statutes or court procedure on their side, and must negotiate their way alone through court hearings that will result in vital decisions about their futures. Where will their children live? How often will they get to see them? Under what conditions? How will the available finances be shared, so that everyone in a now-divided household can make ends meet?</p> <p><U+201C>It is really tough for someone trying to litigate their own family case to be dispassionate,<U+201D> Reed says. <U+201C>There are people who are articulate and intelligent enough to speak for themselves, but whether they are ultimately able to manage it in the moment, in court, and when it<U+2019>s about their children<U+2026> That<U+2019>s not always how it works out. The emotion can overwhelm them and it all just goes out the window.<U+201D></p> <p>***</p> <p><U+201C>There are massive ups and downs,<U+201D> says Peter Johnson, 37, who is trembling and on the brink of tears when I first encounter him just before he goes into court. He is attempting to resolve a painful dispute around a shared residence order that was breached when his ex-wife took their six-year-old son to live in another part of the country.</p> <p>The previous few days have been chaotic and frightening, Johnson explains. <U+201C>Charlie mostly lives with his mum, but has always, regularly, since he was a baby, come to stay with me. We<U+2019>d had some inkling that she wanted to move to a different city, but I share parental responsibility for Charlie: those sorts of decisions, and changing schools, can<U+2019>t happen if I don<U+2019>t agree.<U+201D></p> <p>Feeling worried by his ex-wife<U+2019>s plans, Johnson had applied under his own steam to the family court for a prohibited steps order. If granted, this would have prevented his ex-wife from removing their son from the area. But before his application could be heard, he got an email from her to say she had already gone, taking Charlie with her.</p> <p>It was a huge shock. When he rang the court office to explain, a judge agreed to an emergency hearing. <U+201C>The order was for Charlie to be returned home and that I should go and get him immediately,<U+201D> Johnson says. He starts to shake again as he recalls that day. <U+201C>At that point, because she wasn<U+2019>t taking my calls, I had no idea where Charlie was.<U+201D></p> <p>Johnson is still embroiled in proceedings months later, when I go to meet him at home with his wife, Sara. Toys are neatly tidied away, and outside the kitchen window, baby clothes are drying on the line. He and Sara sit close together.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>I get panic attacks being in the same room as my ex. Her barrister coming to see me before we went in was intimidating</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Johnson earns too much to have been eligible for legal aid, even when it was available, but he pays maintenance for his son, has a newborn baby and a toddler, and Sara is on maternity leave. Life is pretty stressful and, financially, the family is stretched. They don<U+2019>t have a couple of grand <U+2013> minimum <U+2013> going spare, so despite the <U+201C>incredible<U+201D> strain of the situation, which mounts rapidly over the period in which I follow his case, Johnson is determined to see it through by himself.</p> <p>Although he couldn<U+2019>t be described as sanguine about the reality of representing himself <U+2013> <U+201C>I get minor panic attacks just being in the same room as my ex<U+201D> <U+2013> he does believe it<U+2019>s possible to do a decent job on your own behalf in court. <U+201C>You need to be able to control yourself, and you need a certain amount of empathy and understanding of the other person,<U+201D> he says. <U+201C>One of the toughest bits was my ex<U+2019>s barrister coming to see me just before we went in. She started to try to negotiate. It was quite intimidating.<U+201D></p> <p>Even for a well-educated, resourceful couple who have been able to seek advice from two lawyer friends and have argued effectively in court, appearing in person has taken an enormous toll. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s a very big ask, to expect a distraught parent to be calm and objective,<U+201D> Sara says. She adds that she<U+2019>s <U+201C>been left with a huge amount of anger about this whole thing<U+201D>. Johnson agrees that it has been <U+201C>pretty horrible<U+201D>. But, he says, <U+201C>In terms of us, it<U+2019>s made us stronger.<U+201D></p> <p>According to the government<U+2019>s own figures, in the last two years alone, 600,000 people have been excluded from legal aid following cuts set out in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act, which came into force in April 2013. So while Painter and Johnson may feel very alone when they<U+2019>re in front of a judge, they are part of a rapidly growing group of people who are having to make their case on their own behalf in courts up and down the country. According to the National Audit Office, in the first year after family legal aid was dispensed with, there was a <a href=""http://www.nao.org.uk/report/implementing-reforms-to-civil-legal-aid/"">30% increase</a> in the number of cases in which neither party had legal representation in court. This rise, it is argued, is eating into available court time.</p> <p>Far fewer cases can now be heard in a day, explains Julie Exton, president of the <a href=""https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/related-offices-and-bodies/representative-bodies-2/association-hm-district-judges/"">Association of Her Majesty<U+2019>s District Judges</a>, <a href=""http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/analysis/comment-and-opinion/false-economies-afflicting-courts/5048323.fullarticle"">writing in the Law Society Gazette</a>, <U+201C>because the majority of the parties are without legal representation and, unsurprisingly, they tend not to get together with their former partner to try and narrow the issues<U+201D> before coming in front of the judge. Now, much of a hearing has to be spent <U+201C>not only explaining the process to the parties, but also calming them down<U+201D>. Ex-partners see their day in court as <U+201C>an opportunity to vent their hate of their former loved one; a parent who focuses on the best interests of their child is a rarity indeed<U+201D>.</p> <p>In his inaugural speech as the new president of the Law Society in July, solicitor <a href=""http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/news/speeches/inaugural-speech-by-law-society-president-jonathan-smithers-july-2015/"">Jonathan Smithers asserted</a> that <U+201C>the lack of access to justice in this country for a significant proportion of our population undermines society itself<U+2026> Cuts to funding and changes in eligibility have left vulnerable people without representation... While we acknowledge the necessity for financial discipline, there are hard questions to be asked about what price society should be prepared to pay for justice and the very real consequences of not doing so.<U+201D></p> <p>In February, <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/margaret-hodge"">Margaret Hodge</a> MP, the then chair of the public accounts committee, opened <a href=""http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/news/report-implementing-reforms-to-civil-legal-aid/"">a scathing report</a> on how the legal aid cuts were planned and implemented by saying how <U+201C>deeply disturbing<U+201D> it was that the Ministry of Justice<U+2019>s actions were not based on evidence but driven by the aim of cutting costs as quickly as possible. <U+201C>The ministry does not know, and has shown little interest in, the knock-on costs of its reforms across the wider public sector as a result of increased physical and mental health problems caused by the inability to access advice to resolve legal problems,<U+201D> Hodge stated. <U+201C>It therefore has no idea whether the projected <U+00A3>300m spending reduction in its own budget is outweighed by additional costs elsewhere.<U+201D></p> <p>***</p> <p>Another day in court, and a different litigant in person is sitting in a small airless room just off the main lobby. Amira Khalid, 28, recently fled what she says was an abusive marriage, taking her three children with her. The refuge where she secured a place was too far away from her older children<U+2019>s school, so reluctantly she agreed they should return to live with their dad. <U+201C>I am missing my kids,<U+201D> she tells me softly. <U+201C>They come to the refuge, but they have only two days with me.<U+201D></p> <p>Khalid comes from Pakistan. She was brought to the UK by her British husband, whose application to the court for a decision about where their children should live has prompted this hearing today. Her English is limited. She is also undocumented: although she has just applied for indefinite leave to remain, she currently has no right to live in the UK and is terrified she will be sent back to Pakistan without her children. Simply entering a court with no solicitor to protect her interests is, from her point of view, extremely frightening. She will have to sit just metres from the man from whom she fled.</p> <p>Khalid has another problem: no bank account. This means that although she meets the <U+201C>merits<U+201D> test for legal aid (as someone who says she is a victim of domestic abuse and has sought safety in a refuge), she can<U+2019>t prove that she has no funds and so fails the <U+201C>means<U+201D> test. Given that domestic abuse is now understood to include controlling a victim<U+2019>s access to money, using Khalid<U+2019>s lack of a bank account as a reason to refuse legal aid seems baffling.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Amira<U+2019>s English is limited, she's terrified of losing her children and is sitting metres from the man from whom she fled</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dressed in an embroidered black salwar kameez, her long hair held back in a band, Khalid sits quietly, her face tight, one hand repetitively rubbing her wrist as people talk about her case around her. Today, her husband will be represented by a lawyer whom he can afford to pay. She will be on her own. The imbalance in their positions is blindingly obvious. Exactly 800 years on from the signing of <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/culture/ng-interactive/2015/jun/15/magna-carta-read-the-document-in-full-interactive"">Magna Carta</a>, its most famous and prized principle, <U+201C>We will not sell, or deny, or delay right or justice to anyone<U+201D>, must surely, to Khalid and others like her, ring very hollow indeed.</p> <p>Suddenly there<U+2019>s a flurry of action. The husband<U+2019>s barrister and the duty officer for Cafcass (the organisation that represents children in disputed family cases) have drafted an agreement that they<U+2019>re proposing to put before the judge. A piece of paper is handed over. The interpreter takes Khalid through it point by point.</p> <p><U+201C>Is there anything she<U+2019>s not happy with?<U+201D> the Cafcass officer asks.</p> <p>The interpreter asks the question. <U+201C>She worries that the children will not be fed properly by the husband. She says he does not know about cooking,<U+201D> he translates.</p> <p><U+201C>Is there anything else that Mum would like to say in court?<U+201D> the officer asks. <U+201C>Anything at all?<U+201D></p> <p>Khalid is staring at her lap. <U+201C>If I get a solicitor, can I apply to change the order?<U+201D> she asks quietly via the interpreter. <U+201C>She is willing to agree this only as an interim measure,<U+201D> he translates. Speaking faster now, Khalid becomes more agitated. <U+201C>She has real concerns for her two older children.<U+201D></p> <p>Since the cut in legal aid, solicitors, barristers and more recently even the judiciary have attempted ever more vociferously to highlight the procedural mountains that litigants in person must climb, and the injustice and delays caused to parents and, by extension, their children. Khalid<U+2019>s case perfectly illustrates their concerns. Watching this woman, whose English is inadequate to the challenge before her, who knows she has no legal right to be in the country where her children were born, and who is now living in a refuge, sit down in a courtroom just a few seats away from her estranged husband and his lawyer, is to see an already disadvantaged person lose all agency before the law.</p> <p>I call Khalid a couple of times after the hearing, to find out how her case is progressing. If she can prove her lack of income, she tells me, her hope is to secure a legally aided solicitor and make an urgent request for the court to reconsider the arrangements for the children as she tries to rebuild her life. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t want full custody, but shared custody with the father,<U+201D> she says. But when I ring again, a recorded message says the number can no longer receive calls. After more unanswered calls, I email her support worker. It turns out Khalid made a sudden decision to leave the refuge and go back home.</p> <p><U+201C>She told me her husband was going to give her a new sim for her phone as soon as she came back to him, to avoid other individuals contacting her,<U+201D> the support worker explains. Nobody from the refuge can get in touch with Khalid now, but as far as I can establish, she had not managed to secure legal aid when she decided to return to the man she says abused her.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>The judge believed everything my ex said. I<U+2019>m devastated. I feel like I<U+2019>ve made a mess of it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This situation is one that barrister Lucy Reed understands all too well. <U+201C>What worries me is that there will be a group of families who muddle along without coming to court or seeing the process through to getting a final, court-ordered outcome. That could be someone who<U+2019>s been in a controlling or abusive relationship, who doesn<U+2019>t qualify for legal aid, but feels they can<U+2019>t withstand the court process on their own. Or they might fear the conflict going to court would generate, without a lawyer to buffer them. So they feel pushed to accept arrangements for themselves, or for a child, that aren<U+2019>t appropriate or safe. Or you might have dads who think the court process is inherently biased against fathers, who feel disempowered and unable to pursue their case without help <U+2013> so they don<U+2019>t try, and the result is that they don<U+2019>t have any contact with their children at all. That<U+2019>s disastrous, for them and for their children. And of course there are some people who do make it to court, but aren<U+2019>t able to effectively make their very good points, so you end up with less than robust results.<U+201D></p> <p>A number of initiatives do exist to help litigants in person as they attempt to navigate their way through the legal jungle. Last year, the government made a <U+00A3>2m package available for information and support. Reed points out, however, that there is as yet no authorised, independent, government-funded website to assist people heading to court on their own, as was <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/380479/litigants-in-person-in-private-family-law-cases.pdf"">recommended in research commissioned by the Ministry of Justice</a> in November 2014. Frustration at this failure prompted a group of Bristol lawyers, including Reed, to write and launch their own online resource, <a href=""http://familycourtinfo.org.uk"">Family Court Info</a>; the site continues to be updated and edited by the city<U+2019>s legal professionals for free.</p> <p>The <a href=""https://www.thepsu.org/"">Personal Support Unit</a> (PSU) is a charity that provides trained volunteers to offer free assistance to people who are running their own case. The volunteers, who are not legal professionals, but may be law students or other people with an interest in supporting people in crisis, provide emotional support and can accompany a litigant into court. They are not permitted to offer legal advice, however, and though they can help people to understand complex and obscurely phrased court forms, they cannot advise them what to write. Demand for the PSU<U+2019>s services is growing fast; it now has bases in 14 courts in 11 cities, and is expanding at a rate of four new offices a year. It has helped just short of 40,000 people over the past 12 months, a number that is projected to increase to 50,000 in 2015-16.</p> <p>At Bristol<U+2019>s central civil court, law students from the University of the West of England run a part-time drop-in where they offer legal assistance under supervision from their tutor. The area<U+2019>s most senior family judge, Stephen Wildblood QC, has also instigated and personally runs free family law classes for members of the public. With fellow barrister <a href=""http://www.stjohnschambers.co.uk/profile/sarah-phillimore/"">Sarah Phillimore</a> and others in the legal profession, Reed has just launched the <a href=""http://www.familycourtinfo.org.uk/news/pro-bono-scheme-to-launch-in-november/"">Bristol pro bono family scheme</a>, offering half an hour of free advice.</p> <p>All this is welcome, but it cannot bridge the gap, insists Law Society president Smithers. On rough figures, he says, the government has removed half a billion pounds from civil and criminal legal aid. <U+201C>You can<U+2019>t make that up with free legal advice. Lawyers will do a few hours pro bono maybe, but what you won<U+2019>t get is someone to take on a complicated case. No one would argue for a pro bono dentist or doctor: if you want proper professional legal advice, there<U+2019>s a cost.<U+201D></p> <p>The government<U+2019>s swingeing cuts to the legal aid budget, Smithers argues, approach the problem of how to reform the nation<U+2019>s justice system in the wrong way. <U+201C>You can<U+2019>t look at a system that<U+2019>s built up over centuries, say it<U+2019>s costing too much and slice off a bit here and there, because the outcome you get is probably not what you<U+2019>d want,<U+201D> he says. <U+201C>You need to start by asking, <U+2018>What do we want to achieve, what does good justice look like, and how are we going to get that?<U+2019> The case we<U+2019>re trying to make [to government] is that justice is as important to society as education and health. Justice is not about going to court, it<U+2019>s about achieving a fair outcome. And you get that when you get good legal advice.<U+201D></p> <p>Speaking on the phone from Newcastle, Painter is feeling badly stung. The judge in his second hearing made a finding of fact that, on the balance of probabilities, he had been violent to his ex. As the hearing had got under way, the judge had explained that it might be in his best interests not to contest the non-molestation order. Should he do so, she explained, those findings of fact might come back to bite him in later hearings to determine contact with his children.</p> <p>Angry and indignant, Painter chose to press ahead. It didn<U+2019>t turn out well. <U+201C>The judge believed everything my ex said. I<U+2019>m absolutely devastated.<U+201D> He sounds utterly downcast. <U+201C>Her brief, the way she picked out points in my statement<U+2026> If I<U+2019>d had a lawyer, it could have been different. I think they would have put my points over a bit better. And in the end, it<U+2019>s the children<U+2019>s welfare at stake. I feel like I<U+2019>ve made a mess of it.<U+201D></p> <p>Whatever the rights and wrongs, Painter<U+2019>s emotionally charged decision to challenge the order may affect his and his children<U+2019>s lives for years to come. If a lawyer had been there to advise him, who knows if the outcome would have been different?</p> <p><U+2022> Names and some family details have been changed to protect the identities of the children involved.</p>"

They are 12 years old and met on transition day, when primary school students are introduced for the first time to their secondary school. They have been inseparable ever since. Olivia says one thing that binds them together is that they both love the colour purple. She thinks Radiyah is crazy and Radiyah thinks Olivia is crazy. <U+201C>When she sees my brother at school she always says, <U+2018>Hi brother,<U+2019><U+201D> Radiyah says. <U+201C>She never says, <U+2018>Hi Radiya<U+2019>s brother<U+2019>. It<U+2019>s crazy.<U+201D> Olivia accepts that it is a bit crazy.</p> <p>They help each other with homework. Radiyah excels at science and English. Olivia is solid at maths.</p> <p>Olivia does not attend church, but Radiyah, like almost every Asian student in the school, goes to mosque. What does Olivia think of Radiyah<U+2019>s culture? <U+201C>They work so hard for what they believe in. They pray five times a day, they fast.

You could say that it is an experiment in racial integration. But it is also a test for one of the most important theories about how to combat bigotry <strong><U+2013> </strong>and the results could change the way politicians in Britain tackle the problem of prejudice.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>We all have an idea of some of the causes of bias</strong> and bigotry: divisions between racial and ethnic groups, geographic segregation and economic marginalisation, competition for resources between rival groups. And most people, at least today, probably share an essentially optimistic intuition about how to reduce racism and ethnic conflict, based on the belief that as people and communities get to know one another better <U+2013> to interact as neighbours and co-workers and friends <U+2013> their prejudices will melt away. This is a happy story, but is it true? After all, some of the longest and most violent conflicts in the world involve groups who know one another all too well <U+2013> whose proximity, in fact, seems only to exacerbate ethnic tension.</p> <p>Among the psychologists who study bigotry and ethnic conflict, this optimistic theory is known as the <U+201C>contact hypothesis<U+201D>. It was introduced by the Harvard psychologist Gordon W Allport, who published a book titled The Nature of Prejudice in 1954 <U+2013> the same year that the US supreme court issued its landmark decision, <a href=""http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/history-brown-v-board-education-re-enactment"">Brown v Board of Education</a>, which forced the desegregation of American schools. Allport believed that prejudice flowed from ignorance: people made generalisations about an entire group because they lacked information about that group. Contact with members of the other group could correct mistaken perceptions, improve empathy and diminish prejudice.</p> <p>The theory has a beautiful simplicity and an instant feel<U+2011>good appeal. But it has also been also backed up over the years by well over 500 studies, of varying degrees of scientific rigour. Allport himself believed that contact would only help if it occurred under various conditions <U+2013> for example, the groups had to pursue common rather than opposing goals. Nowadays, however, psychologists believe that almost all contact improves relations between groups, provided that it does not take place in an environment of intense anxiety or fear.</p> <p>Allport<U+2019>s hypothesis concerned how existing prejudice could be reduced. But other academics wanted to discover what the origins of prejudice were. Before the 1970s, the conventional wisdom was that it had two causes. One was competition: teams competing at football, families squabbling over land, nations fighting wars. The second was personality. Some people, the theory went, were more inclined to discriminate than others; prejudice was linked to traits such as authoritarianism, associated with a highly subservient attitude towards authority figures and an authoritarian attitude towards lower-status minorities.</p> <p>However, in the 1970s, a <a href=""http://www.sociallypsyched.org/item/minimal-group-paradigm"">social psychologist named Henri Tajfel</a> began a series of experiments in Britain that would revolutionise how we understand the origins of group bias. He showed that neither of the two causes <U+2013> competition and personality <U+2013> was required for prejudice to emerge. All that was required was for people to be organised into groups in the first place.</p> <p>In Tajfel<U+2019>s most famous experiment, he asked a group of teenage boys to rate various abstract paintings by Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky. Tajfel then placed the boys into two groups: <U+201C>Klee<U+201D> and <U+201C>Kandinsky<U+201D> <U+2013> and told them they had been grouped according to which artist they preferred. (In fact, they were sorted into groups randomly.) They were then given some notional money and told to distribute it among the participants in the experiment. They could not see or talk to the potential beneficiaries, who were identified only on paper by a number and by their group identity <U+2013> Klee or Kandinsky.</p> <p>The result was startling. The children showed a consistent pattern of bias. Although there was no competition between the two groups, the boys donated more money to individuals who were members of their own group. Thus, a member of the Kandinsky group was likely to give more money to other Kandinsky group members than to the members of the Klee group. Tajfel had demonstrated that group bias will occur under the most minimal of conditions <U+2013> mere categorisation. This result has been replicated many times since Tajfel<U+2019>s first experiment. The implications are profoundly unsettling. It shows how easy it is to switch on discrimination: our belonging to social groups is fundamental to our social identity and we like to see <U+201C>us<U+201D> as better than <U+201C>them<U+201D>.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""e3ff0ebc9ce54b0c305941e97ef76371b71d161f""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/e3ff0ebc9ce54b0c305941e97ef76371b71d161f/0_803_4422_2653/1000.jpg"" alt=""Kingsmead primary school, London"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption""><U+2018>Nowadays, psychologists believe that almost all contact improves relations between groups.<U+2019></span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Gideon Mendel/In Pictures/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tajfel taught psychology for many years at Bristol University. In the 1970s one of his undergraduate students was Miles Hewstone, who went on to become a professor at Oxford University. Hewstone is a kindly, cheerful, bespectacled, slightly disorganised professor who is always running late and usually one wardrobe malfunction short of debonair. When I met him earlier this autumn, he was wearing odd cufflinks because he had not had time to find a matching pair.</p> <p>Miles Hewstone is the intellectual offspring of Henri Tajfel and Gordon Allport. Under Tajfel<U+2019>s tutelage, Hewstone learned how quickly individuals from one group could come to scorn those in another. But, by temperament, Hewstone is much closer to Allport: he is an optimist. Hewstone is less interested in how rapidly groups can make enemies than how enemies can be turned into friends <U+2013> or, more modestly, how former enemies can learn to tolerate one another. Over the past three decades, his work has taken him to the places where group conflict has seemed most intractable: South Africa, Cyprus, Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Serbia.</p> <p>As an undergraduate, Hewstone had come across the contact hypothesis as a core part of his psychology degree. He liked the optimism of the theory, but felt that it was flawed. It had little to say about the importance of groups in the construction of our social identity. In the mid-1980s, Hewstone gave the contact hypothesis a Tajfelian twist, one best illustrated with an example adapted from research he conducted with a collaborator, Rupert Brown.</p> <p>Britons hold various stereotypes about Germans. As we all know, Germans are hard-working, earnest, technically proficient and that at precisely 6am they ruthlessly commandeer all the deck chairs on the nearest beach. Plus, they are humourless: a German joke is no laughing matter, as Mark Twain put it. Hewstone wanted to know whether he could break down these stereotypes. He had seen how easy it was to turn on prejudice; now he wanted to see how to turn it off. (His wife Claudia, born in the Black Forest region of southern Germany, had a personal interest in her husband<U+2019>s study.)</p> <p>Student subjects were split into two groups. They were told that there was a German behind a screen, whom they were not allowed to see but about whom they were given certain details. Half the subjects were presented with a German with stereotypical characteristics <U+2013> he was called Heinrich, he was an engineer <U+2013> and half had a German called Anthony, who had <U+201C>unexpected<U+201D> characteristics, such as studying Chinese literature.</p> <p>Participants carried out cooperative tasks with the invisible <U+201C>German<U+201D> <U+2013> and were then asked about their attitudes to Germans and Germany. It turned out that those who had cooperated with Heinrich were more positive about Germans in general than those who had worked with Anthony. Heinrich was so obviously German that constructive contact with him influenced attitudes to Germans in general. Anthony, on the other hand, did not positively influence attitudes towards Germans since he seemed so clearly exceptional <U+2013> he was, in the jargon, a sub-type.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>For contact to work, one does not want to put individuals through some kind of identity blender</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The result might seem counterintuitive. Indeed, Hewstone told me, other academic experts thought their conclusions were <U+201C>bonkers<U+201D>. But as a disciple of Tajfel, Hewstone had always recognised the centrality of group membership to identity. These days, his findings are widely accepted: for group prejudice to be eroded, group identity has to be maintained. In other words, contact itself is not enough.</p> <p>Positive contact between members of antagonistic groups will improve how members of these groups generally see each other only if the people involved are seen as representative of their group. For contact to work, one does not want to put individuals through some kind of identity blender, to produce a homogeneous group.<strong> </strong>The aim is that people can see other people precisely as <U+201C>other<U+201D> and then realise that other isn<U+2019>t bad.</p> <p>Having travelled around the world testing his contact hypothesis, a few years ago a rare opportunity to assess it again presented itself to Hewstone. This conflict zone was closer to home <U+2013> a mere three-hour car journey north of Oxford. He heard about plans for a new school that would bring together two communities in the heart of one of Britain<U+2019>s most racially segregated towns. For an academic in his field, it presented a unique opportunity.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Oldham is a town of 200,000 people,</strong> a few miles north-east of Manchester. In the 19th century, it was the world<U+2019>s biggest producer of cotton textiles, but the industry began to decline after the first world war <U+2013> and from the 1950s<strong>, </strong>its collapse became inevitable. Today, Oldham is one of the most deprived towns in Britain, and one of the most segregated. These are conditions in which the contact hypothesis predicts trouble.</p> <p>Oldham<U+2019>s two largest minority communities are Pakistani and Bangladeshi <U+2013> together they make up around 20% of the population. Immigrants from Pakistan arrived first, in the 1950s and 60s, and those from Bangladesh began to arrive in the 1970s. Many came from rural areas; some were illiterate, and many others spoke little to no English. They mostly worked night shifts, which were introduced in the 1960s, as the mills struggled to remain profitable. As the number of immigrants increased, and the night shift became the almost exclusive preserve of the minority community, contact between white people and Asians in the mills diminished.</p> <p>The new arrivals settled into areas such as Glodwick, which is now mainly Pakistani. There is a well-studied phenomenon of tipping points in housing markets, in which individual tolerances for a certain racial mix <U+2013> say, a white resident who does not mind living in a neighbourhood with a 20% minority population, but balks at one where 30% of his neighbours are non-white <U+2013> can result in an area rapidly shifting from one ethnicity to another. That is what happened in Glodwick and other parts of Oldham. It is true that there were racist landlords and some evidence of official discrimination in social housing allocation, but there was no engineered separation. In Oldham, segregation was the result of tens of thousands of individual decisions.</p> <p>And segregation was not only about housing. With the decline of the textile industries, jobs were scarce. From the 1990s onwards, many Asians who found work became mini-cab drivers or entered the restaurant business. Contact with white people was superficial, and sometimes hostile <U+2013> as when Asian drivers took home drunk passengers on a Saturday night. The Asians played cricket in their own areas, went to their local mosques and socialised with fellow immigrants. The schools reinforced the segregation: if anything, schools were more segregated than neighbourhoods.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""d9c3cf7a622cdb3d516ad6dc5eb956127369c6f5""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/d9c3cf7a622cdb3d516ad6dc5eb956127369c6f5/0_90_2048_1229/1000.jpg"" alt=""Oldham riots, 2001"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A girl runs away from the burning Greenhill Mill school, petrol-bombed by rioters, in Oldham, May 2001.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Odd Andersen/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, few could have anticipated the violence that erupted on 26 May 2001. That day, a white teenager threw a brick at two Asian boys aged 11 and 14, who had been walking along a street that divided the white neighbourhood of Roundthorn from Glodwick. One of the Asian boys, along with his brother, gave chase. The white boy found refuge in a nearby home <U+2013> and the Asian boys began to kick at the door. The white woman who lived there shouted racial abuse at them. She phoned her brother to tell him:<U+201C>Some Pakis have kicked the door in.<U+201D></p> <p>It was an unpleasant episode, but hardly exceptional. Yet it ignited a conflagration: by the evening, hundreds of Asian men had gathered in Glodwick, where they put up barricades and threw stones and petrol bombs at the police, who were now in full riot gear. The crowd attacked a number of buildings, including the office of the Oldham Evening Chronicle, a newspaper that some South Asians felt had cynically stoked racial tension.</p> <p>The unrest continued for three nights. Britain had not witnessed race riots on a similar scale for 15 years. Radio and television bulletins all led on Oldham: Glodwick and other neighbourhoods were invaded by journalists. The town became known as <U+201C>the race-hate capital<U+201D> of Britain.</p> <p>In hindsight, the seeds of the trouble should have been clear. The far-right National Front and the British National party had been agitating in Oldham for a year, having identified the town as fertile territory for recruiting. There had been reports that many white people had been victims of racially motivated abuse and violence. A few weeks before the riots, a war veteran in his mid-70s named <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/apr/28/race.immigrationpolicy"">Walter Chamberlain</a> had been beaten by a 14-year-old Asian teenager. Chamberlain<U+2019>s battered face appeared on the front pages of national newspapers, with hysterical headlines such as <U+201C>Whites beware<U+201D> (Mail on Sunday) and <U+201C>Beaten for being white<U+201D> (the Mirror) <U+2013> despite the fact that Chamberlain<U+2019>s own family insisted the attack had not been racially motivated. The BNP circulated leaflets alleging that parts of Oldham had become <U+201C>no-go areas<U+201D> for whites. The Asian community, meanwhile, felt it had been left unprotected by the police.</p> <p>The riots in Oldham sparked similar scenes in the nearby towns of Bradford and Burnley. The government and local authorities immediately commissioned reports on what lay behind this unrest. The reports, which were delivered before the end of the year, highlighted the role that segregation had played in fostering animosity between white and Asian citizens. <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/dec/11/race.world5"">The Cantle report</a>, commissioned by the home secretary, found that white and Asian communities were living <U+201C>parallel<U+201D> and <U+201C>polarised<U+201D> lives. (Ted Cantle, the sociologist and local government official who led the inquiry, had said that he was very familiar with the contact hypothesis from his undergraduate studies.) The <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jun/29/politics.race"">Ritchie report</a>, which focused on Oldham specifically, concluded that <U+201C>the major issue in Oldham town is the segregated nature of society<U+201D>. Amongst the report<U+2019>s recommendations was that <U+201C>wherever possible, the rebuild of schools should create the opportunity for further integration of pupils<U+201D>.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/09/integrated-schools-just-part-of-the-answer-to-questions-of-community-cohesion"">Integrated schools just part of the answer to questions of community cohesion | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The reports were published three months after the 11 September terror attacks, at a time when politicians were becoming increasingly anxious about segregation and Islamic extremism. But tackling racial segregation is no easy process. For one thing, it is a notoriously complex phenomenon. In the social sciences, it is hard to think of a more contested arena <U+2013> geographers and political scientists cannot even agree on how to quantify the extent of segregation. One difficulty is deciding where to draw the demographic dividing lines: changing the boundaries of a given area even slightly can result in a highly segregated area being reclassified as a mixed one, and vice versa. When you drill down into the figures, the complexities multiply.</p> <p>That debate aside, even if towns such as Oldham are segregated, some might say: <U+201C>So what? Isn<U+2019>t it natural for people of similar cultural background <U+2013> whether whites or Asians <U+2013> to want to live and socialise with one another? Shouldn<U+2019>t we be more relaxed about this?<U+201D> After all, there is evidence that residential clustering can foster a sense of belonging and security. Charlie Parker, who was chief executive of Oldham council from 2008 until 2013, told the writer David Goodhart that segregation was a sign of people feeling comfortable with their identities.</p> <p>But after the 2001 riots that position no longer seemed tenable. The received wisdom, at least among policy makers, was that segregation did exist <U+2013> and that it was a disaster. So they took action <U+2013> and that is how Radiyah and Olivia came to meet.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Until a few years ago, </strong>OL4 3NY was the postcode for an abandoned and derelict cotton mill. Now, in its place, stands an impressive red brick and glass structure. The corridors and reception areas are generously laid out, the classrooms pristine, the facilities first-rate. Welcome to Waterhead academy. Ted Cantle calls it <U+201C>a unique school<U+201D>. Miles Hewstone likened it to mixing a pint of milk and a pint of Guinness in a quart pot.</p> <p>The idea for Waterhead goes back to 2007. It was designed to take advantage of the <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/jul/05/buried-report-labour-school-building"">Building Schools for the Future programme</a>, introduced in the last term of the Labour government, which set aside money to construct new buildings for Britain<U+2019>s secondary schools. For most of the schools that received this funding, the new building or school was intended to symbolise a new educational start. But for Waterhead, it symbolised something more: the academy was created at least in part to bring communities together.</p> <p>Waterhead was born from two turbulent parents. Breeze Hill was an almost entirely Asian school, Counthill almost entirely white. They both drew from working-class communities. They both had what educationists call <U+201C>challenges<U+201D>. Attainment levels were low. Aspirations were low. Both schools had serious disciplinary and drug issues. The idea was that Breeze Hill and Counthill would shut and their students be relocated to the brand new Waterhead academy.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Boys and girls play sport separately, there is a modest uniform code, and assemblies draw from many religious traditions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Before Breeze Hill and Counthill were closed in 2010, there was a consultation period. The proposal to create one large school of 1,400 pupils had caused consternation. Some of that was understandable resistance to change, but some Asian parents and teachers from Breeze Hill were nervous that their kids would be subject to racist abuse. Local whites in the lower-middle-class neighbourhood of Waterhead demonstrated against the merger. They said they were worried about the disruption that a big school would cause in the area. There was also an element of dog-whistle politics: one senior figure in Oldham<U+2019>s educational establishment told me that many white parents in the area would rather send their kids to a failing monocultural school than a thriving mixed one. A teacher at Waterhead sheepishly admitted that his mother and brother had joined the placard-waving protestors: his brother, who was caught up in the 2001 riots, is a BNP sympathiser. (There was also a separate political strain of opposition to Waterhead: some of the placards said: <U+201C>No to academies<U+201D>.)</p> <p>When Miles Hewstone heard about Waterhead, he was eager to see how it went: a perfect test of his contact hypothesis. Waterhead is what Hewstone calls <U+201C>a natural experiment<U+201D><strong> </strong><U+2013> one that he, along with his two post-doctoral researchers, Katharina Schmid and Ananthi Al Ramiah, was granted access to study.</p> <p>The merger between Breeze Hill and Counthill was handled with caution. Between 2010 and 2012, the schools continued to operate on separate sites, and the children were brought together for particular classes or activities. The new building was opened for business in September 2012. Like many of her colleagues, one former Breeze Hill science teacher, Faizal Ahmed, who now teaches at Waterhead, was afraid that <U+201C>there were going to be clashes every single day, there was going to be uproar; we were going to be in the papers.<U+201D></p> <p>The newly merged school had to carefully navigate various multicultural sensitivities: boys and girls play sport separately, there is a modest uniform code, and assemblies draw from a number of religious traditions. Halal meat is available, but so are bacon sandwiches. All these issues seemed more prickly in anticipation than in practice. And remember that according to Hewstone<U+2019>s version of the contact hypothesis, contact works best when British white children see British Asian pupils as being in some sense typical of their culture, and vice versa.</p> <p>Radiyah was one of the students who were apprehensive about Waterhead. The school had not been her parents<U+2019> first choice. There were lots of menacing rumours, Radiyah said. <U+201C>I thought, because I<U+2019>m a different skin colour, people might say things to me <U+2013> racist things. But, first day, second day, everything was perfect. The rumours weren<U+2019>t true.<U+201D></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Radiyah<U+2019>s friend Olivia also loves the school. </strong>Their friendship offers anecdotal evidence that, in terms of social cohesion, Waterhead has been a resounding success. But Hewstone does not believe in drawing conclusions from anecdotes. He is a social scientist, and he likes to stress the second half of his job title. He collects data and subjects it to rigorous analysis.</p> <p>Over the past three and a half years, he and his team of half a dozen post graduates have amassed an enormous amount of data. As well as surveys tracking changes in attitudes and values, Christina Floe, a doctoral student working with Hewstone, has painstakingly gathered statistics on friendship networks at the school. She asked every student in several year-groups<strong> </strong>to list up to 10 of their closest friends, and monitored how their social groups evolved over a two-year period. The data Floe gathered was then uploaded onto a computer program, which turned the information into diagrams that look like they have been drawn by an inebriated spider.</p> <p>Floe also studied friendship groups in Waterhead<U+2019>s cafeteria. Her aim was to chart who sat next to whom at lunch. It was important that the pupils did not know what she was checking for, so she needed a cover. Floe approached the students in the canteen to hand out food-satisfaction surveys. Underneath the surveys on Floe<U+2019>s clipboard she had a map of the room, with all the tables and seats marked up, and as the forms were filled out she quickly scribbled the appropriate acronym for the relevant seat <U+2013> AF (Asian female), AM, WF or WM.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>The findings show that each and every year trust and liking  between pupils from different ethnic groups improve</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Depending on your viewpoint, the results of some of these studies are either positive or positively depressing. The observational data from the cafeteria shows that whites and Asians overwhelmingly eat in their own ethnic groups. As for the network study, shortly after the pupils first arrived at school, only 2.5% of the close friends of white students were Asians. Even by the end of that year, close friendships remained almost entirely segregated <U+2013> Asians accounted for just 7.5% of the friends of white children. Still, there is some cause for hope: Hewstone<U+2019>s team has found that each year is slightly more integrated than the one below it.</p> <p>But the survey data <U+2013> which begins from the period just before the schools physically merged in 2012, and is based on following up the same sample of hundreds of students year on year <U+2013> is much more impressive. The aim was to investigate attitudes towards members of the rival ethnic group over time.</p> <p>It asked the children, for example: <U+201C>When you meet white British/Asian British boys do you feel nervous?<U+201D> And the children rated their answer on a scale of one (not at all) to five (very). Another question, on the same scale, was: <U+201C>How much do you trust white British/Asian British pupils?<U+201D></p> <p>Hewstone says that he is completely <U+201C>blown away<U+201D> by the results. The findings show that each and every year the positive variables <U+2013> trust and liking <U+2013> improve. And each and every year, even more dramatically, the negative variables <U+2013> anxiety and nervousness about the other group <U+2013> decrease.</p> <p>So, on the one-to-five scale, the negative attitude of Asians to whites from 2012 to 2015 dropped from 3.078 to 2.583. For the white group the drop is from 3.572 to 3.183. Maarten van Zalk, another member of the team, who performed the data analysis on these statistics, says this was <U+201C>much better than expected<U+201D>. And it looks like the improvement just continues with time. He is excited to see the next set of figures in June 2016.</p> <p>Hewstone is very upbeat, even about the less than spectacular friendship stats. As he points out, the context in Oldham was not auspicious, which led countless people to predict disaster for Waterhead. Had there been no school merger, then chances are that 11-year-old white students, rather than having a few Asian friends, would have had none at all.</p> <p>There are several surprises and nuances in the data. You might assume that the most popular children would be the most outgoing ones, and that they would be most likely to make friends across the racial divide. In fact the reverse is the case. The popular kids have the fewest number of cross-racial friendships. (A plausible explanation is that humans can only cope with a few close friends, and the friendship quota for popular kids is more rapidly filled; having many friends makes people less inclined to seek new ones.)</p> <p>How long the beneficial impact of contact lasts is open to debate. Once their education is over, many pupils will return to segregated neighbourhoods and their separate lives. But Hewstone likes to quote Thomas Paine: <U+201C>The mind once enlightened cannot again become dark.<U+201D> He argues that a dose of integration acts as a kind of inoculation for life <U+2013> a permanent booster of tolerance and understanding.</p> <p>There is a fly in the ointment, however. None of the more extravagant fears of racial conflict at Waterhead has come to pass. But, ultimately, for the school to succeed it has to improve academically. The latest Ofsted report, following an inspection in November 2014, makes demoralising reading: <U+201C>Leadership and management <U+2013> Inadequate<U+201D>; <U+201C>Behaviour and safety of pupils <U+2013> Inadequate<U+201D>; <U+201C>Quality of teaching <U+2013> Inadequate<U+201D>; <U+201C>Achievement of pupils <U+2013> Inadequate<U+201D>. In December 2014, the school was placed under special measures. That means Ofsted will make regular inspections and if the poor performance continues the school may even be closed.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""a887f930ebec63e5fb99aca2f679514b206b5479""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/a887f930ebec63e5fb99aca2f679514b206b5479/21_10_1107_1679/659.jpg"" alt=""Glodwick, Oldham"" width=""659"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption""><U+2018>In a town with a long history of segregation and tension, there has not been a single racist incident at Waterhead since headteacher Colette Macklin took over in 2014.<U+2019></span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In September 2014, Colette Macklin, a new head with a no<U+2011>nonsense reputation, was appointed, and the governors are convinced that they now have the right processes in place to turn Waterhead around. Headteachers at Waterhead, however, do not seem to survive very long. Macklin is the third in five years. And this year, Waterhead ranked in the bottom 200 schools in the country for GCSE results. It would be naive to expect too dramatic an improvement in results, given the social and economic context in which the school operates. Almost half of the children at Waterhead qualify for pupil-premium funding <U+2013> additional money to help schools cope with the most disadvantaged children.</p> <p>All the problems aside, an extraordinary fact remains. In the year since Macklin became head of this extremely deprived school, in a town with a long history of segregation and tension, there has not been a single racist incident among her pupils.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>In July, the prime minister made a speech on extremism</strong> that ended with a call for action to tackle ethnic segregation: <U+201C>It cannot be right <U+2026> that people can grow up and go to school and hardly ever come into meaningful contact with people from other backgrounds and faiths.<U+201D> He mentioned two cities where segregation was particularly marked. The first was Bradford, the second was Oldham. Cameron was careful not to lay the blame on any one community. Housing was an issue, he said, as was education.</p> <p>The speech tackled sensitive issues around segregation and extremism, but in one respect it was gutless. Faith schools tend to exacerbate segregation <U+2013> but Cameron defended them. Challenging the power of the faith schools and their (often middle-class) admirers was clearly an electoral risk too far. Still, taking the contact hypothesis theory seriously would require confronting the faith-school lobby.</p> <p>More broadly, taking the contact hypothesis seriously demands directing resources <U+2013> in a way that does not create a backlash <U+2013> towards bringing segregated groups together, whether this be in education, housing or leisure. It means helping people become proficient in the English language and making public spaces attractive to all communities.</p> <p>Back in Oldham, Radiyah and Olivia could serve as poster girls for Cameron<U+2019>s integration agenda. At school their cultural differences <U+2013> of which they are aware <U+2013> seem small compared to what they have in common. Olivia is joking about Radiyah<U+2019>s purple pencil case, and her obsession with all things purple. Their rapport has an infectious quality. Even so, it is more complex than appears at first sight. They have never visited each other<U+2019>s homes <U+2013> they do not even know where the other lives, though they regularly talk on Skype after school. That is not unusual for cross-racial friendships at Waterhead <U+2013> the friendship checks in and then checks out again at the school gate. As they stream out of school at 3pm, the Asian and white kids go home to separate neighbourhoods. Radiyah and Olivia live less than two miles apart <U+2013> though the psychological distance between their two neighbourhoods is substantially greater.</p> <p>This, then, is a slow, incremental evolution, not an overnight revolution <U+2013> and one susceptible to setbacks. As for the two girls, will they be best friends for ever? Olivia thinks so, but Radiyah is less convinced. <U+201C>Maybe not forever, because sometimes she<U+2019>s really annoying.<U+201D> Olivia looks momentarily pained. <U+201C>But I like it that she<U+2019>s a bit annoying, because I don<U+2019>t want boring friends.<U+201D> And with that, they are off down the corridor, nudging each other and giggling.</p> <p><em>David Edmonds is a senior research associate at the Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics.
