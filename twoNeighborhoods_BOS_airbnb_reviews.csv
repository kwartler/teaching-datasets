"28699","I had a great experience staying with Jazz. She has a wonderful apartment and the room (and bed!) is very comfortable. It was all very clean and welcoming. I just stayed for one night after a business trip and the location was very convenient. Very near to the city centre - all in walking distance. Jazz was a great host and very willing to help and give tips. Would absolutely recommend Jazz's place!!","Leather District"
"28617","The reservation was canceled 23 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","Leather District"
"28621","Great apt to stay at in Boston.  Very close to south (email hidden)ke 2 min walk.   Very spacious apt, perfect for business or recreational traveling.  The place was very clean as well.   I would definitely stay here again when in Boston.

"28647","My stay with Jazz couldn't have been more pleasant. The loft was spotless, and I immediately felt at home. ","Leather District"
"28665","A perfect place, very clean and so beautiful ! We felt like at home, with a friendly host. Jazz is a wonderful people, very funny and attentive to your needs. We miss her already.","Leather District"
"28615","Jazz was a great host, and the loft is incredible. It is so clean, and the location is ideal for getting around Boston. My boyfriend and I stayed there together, but it is also a great place for when you want to have some privacy. Great communication from Jazz as well. She was always available if we needed anything. She had great recommendations for things to do and places to eat in Boston, too. I will definitely be staying at Jazz's loft when I come back to Boston!","Leather District"
"27482","Alexandra's apartment is centrally located and very close to the Green Line which makes it convenient. Her apartment is newly renovated. Alexandra was easy to communicate via airbnb messaging (don't email her since she does not check it often). The room has a nice closet, towels and she even left new slippers for guests. The room is very dark at night and in the morning since the window faces another building. 

I do wish we would have realized ahead of time that the bed was a modified futon. The pad was thicker than your normal futon, but the back support was not all that great. My parents were actually supposed to stay here while visiting Boston and after one night we had to switch because my dad had back problems. ","Mission Hill"
"15601.1","Pros: 
- good location
- easy access to public transportation
- wireless internet, running water, lights turn on
- host was prompt with responses via email/text/phone
- reasonable price

Cons:
Despite what the host says, there are STILL bed bugs at this apartment. My friend and I found bugs EVERY, SINGLE night and woke up with bites. I took pictures of the bugs too and would post it up if it were possible. When the problem was addressed to the host  in person at the end of my stay, he came off as defensive and kept repeating the fact that he had hired someone to get rid of the bed bugs already. But at the end of the day, there are still bed bugs so it doesn't matter to me if someone was hired to exterminate the bugs already. I understand that this place was fairly inexpensive to rent, but the apartment was dusty and bug infested. I had to frantically wash all my clothes and sheets when I got home. ","Mission Hill"
"13221","Nice spacious apartment. Location handy to South Station, Chinatown and the city. Matt was responsive and easy to deal with.","Leather District"
"835","I unfortunately did not have the pleasant experience so many others have reviewed for this space. I arrived to find the bed unmade, dirty towels and the space uncleaned from the previous guests. I had been traveling for many hours and was wanting to rest for a bit. When I communicated my concerns to Sean about this, he basically said """"who takes a nap at 1pm"""", and """"well, this is how I do it"""". Sean had also mentioned to me that the details of the space not being cleaned upon check-in were in the airbnb description. I told him this was not the case and he said, """"oh, I have two spaces in that building, it's probably mentioned for the other space'. Had I received some thoughtfulness or concern from Sean about all of this, I would have given him the benefit of the doubt. But as it was, I felt mistreated and disregarded. I will certainly not be staying here or at any of Sean's other places. I do not recommend him as a host.","Mission Hill"
"10129","THIS place was TERRIBLE and DOES not meet minimum cleanliness standards.

Joshua was not upfront that there are 5 other people leaving in that APT. Also he did not tell me that he does not live there any more. Basically he was subletting the place and I was not informed of this. 

The place is really Dark and very badly maintained by these 2o year old college kids. There was one bathroom used by all the five 5 roommates and it was nasty as hell. The other bathroom was on a different floor and the plumbing was broken. The bathrooms were not cleaned for months, as I could see rolls or used toilet paper and empty shampoo bottles with sticky floor. 

Since Joshua doe not live there and was a surprise for me, I was not comfortable staying with these people, and compete for the nastiest bathroom. I tried tried taking the shower and the water would not drain and my whole body started itching for the whole day with red rashes. 

I basically vacated the place without staying for a night, even though I reserved for 2 weeks.

I do not recommend this place for any one as this does not meet the cleanness standards or a place you would have to pay so much. Description does not meet what I say there.

Worst part the kitchen and the washing room were so dark and nasty with lots of Trash from almost 3 months lying all over the APT. I could even smell POT all over the place. There were cigarette buds 100's of them all over the APT, bathroom, kitchen etc.
","Mission Hill"
"28611","Felt like home. Thanks Jazz, I'll come back!","Leather District"
"15581.1","Please read this review before you consider booking this place! Also please note that I am yet to leave a bad review on yelp. My partner and I have been travelling with airbnb stops for about the last 4 months and are not at all fussy travellers. 
The apartment is not what it seems when you book it.
Pictures-
The pictures on the site do not clearly represent the apartment. The photos are spaciously deceptive and do not  give a true representation of what we found when we arrived. There is not room for one person to be comfortable here let alone two travellers with suitcases. The pictures did not show how two people would have to sleep - with one on a mattress on the floor. The pictures also do not portray the state of the apartment - the kitchen and bathroom were both not in the condition in which we found the place.


Cleanliness-
The place was not acceptable to live in. It was disgusting. The bathroom tiles are filed with mould and rust and dust. The floors are all covered with dust and look like the place has never seen a broom before. I could never allow for a places would stay in to get like that let alone to leave it in such a state and have the nerve to let someone else stay there. It is an embarrassment to do such a thing. The kitchen was also disgusting and left uncleaned from when it was last used. It was in such a state that we did not feel comfortable to use the facilities. 

Overall it was a disgusting place to stay in where we can barely fit ourselves in let alone all of our luggage. I definitely do NOT recommend for anyone to stay here. We payed an outrageous price to stay in such a place - one of our most expensive stops on our trip and with out a doubt the worst. ","Mission Hill"
"15795","Sean wasn't around when we came to Boston but he was very helpful and gave very clear directions. While I wish I can say, """"You get what you pay for,"""" I don't think we got our money's worth - YEP, even for that price, we did expect more. We've stayed at really nice/clean studios with prices relative to Sean's studio and we were pretty disappointed in the cleanliness of this one. As previous reviews stated, the bathroom needs some work but overall, we had an OK experience here. Good location; parking is difficult. ","Mission Hill"
"15600.1","I'm hesitant to give this 2 stars -- I'd like to give it one or none -- because I got BED BUGS from this place!  But I have to be fair and say that the location and convenience are great; it's super close to the T, great point from which to explore Boston and restaurants and shops close by. Also, Sean was accommodating and helpful; he brought us more bedding when we needed it and also let us keep our bags in the studio for a few hours past check out time on the day we left so that we wouldn't have to traipse through Boston with them.  BUT, and it's a big BUT, this place feels like it hasn't had a good cleaning in years.  There is dust everywhere and worst of all, the mold was THICK in the bathroom.  So bad and so nasty that I went out and bought tile cleaner and cleaned the thing myself!  When Sean came by (to drop the bedding) he noticed I had cleaned and said something about oh, it'll just be back because there isn't ventilation.  Um, no, it won't come back if you clean regularly.  He also said something along the lines of, well, that's why it's not $200 a night.  Again, no.  I don't care how much I'm paying, I expect a clean and healthy place -- and mold in every crevice of the bathroom is just plain disgusting and unhealthy.  There are also missing tiles in the bathroom floor and some are coming up.  I took pictures of all this by the way, because I couldn't believe it. I wouldn't care so much about that if -- again -- I felt that the bathroom floor had been properly scrubbed in the last year or so.  But whatever, I could get over all that -- it's the BED BUGS I'm mad about.  Lo and behold I come home and to dozens -- maybe hundreds? -- of bites all over my body.  I'd post pictures but they are rather gross. It takes a few days for them to appear so I didn't realize it till after I left, because believe me, otherwise I would have called Sean and AirBnB and demanded a new place to stay.  So yeah, here I am at home, now frantically washing all my clothes and linens.  So if the place were cleaned and exterminated, I'd give it a 3 or 4 (it is very small) but as is, I'd say go somewhere else!","Mission Hill"
"15769","Small studio about the size of a bedroom with a bathroom.  Reminded me of living in a college dorm.  The price was the main selling point and the area around the studio was good.  Plenty of places to eat nearby and close to a number of colleges as well as the train line.  The building is quite old and the walls are thin.  Might not be good for light sleepers as there is a bit of noise and the studio is near the subway.  

Sean was nice and very easy to get a hold of for questions.  The lockbox was easy to use.  I arrived a bit early but was able to get in.  Sean was by the place around 3 to clean up.

To sum it up, it's a good cheap place to sleep for a night or two on a budget.  You'd have a hard time finding a place at this price in Boston.","Mission Hill"
"28670","Jazz's place was absolutely beautiful! The bed was comfy and the bathroom was extremely clean. Jazz was an incredibly welcoming host. She let me drop off my bags before check in time and offered me coffee, tea, and food in the morning. All around it was a great experience!","Leather District"
"28656","This was a very clean, comfortable, and pleasant place to stay.  The location can't be beat and Jazz went out of her way to make me feel welcome.  A+++!","Leather District"
"16505","Nicolas was a fantastic host - communicative, prompt, generous, responsive.  The place itself was equally divine.  A warm, elegant, luxurious space with comfortable beds, great seating areas and a perfect layout.  The area can be a bit raw and boisterous, but that's the Leather District for you.. All in all, a really excellent stay.","Leather District"
"28620","If you have a change to stay at Jazz's, do it. She was so amazingly welcoming. She gave me great suggestions for places to eat and really made me feel at home. Her apartment was lovely and clean. It was really a great place to stay if you are in Boston. The location is great too. It was so easy to walk everywhere. Staying here really made my trip. I would definitely stay here again.","Leather District"
"28686","Absolutely perfect! Everything was spotless, Jazz was flexible in the key handoff and told me to make myself at home. She even provided coffee and breakfast in the morning. The location was safe and quiet as well as within walking distance to plenty. I had to stay here two nights while traveling for work, it was my first Airbnb experience and I will definitely use Airbnb again as well as recommend her location.","Leather District"
"15798.1","Sean was prompt in answering phone calls, though he seemed not to be reading SMS and emails. So contact him by phone calls. 

Pros: The place was overall clean. The location is very convenient and close to the Green Line and many shops. The fridge and the microwave oven worked properly. 

Cons: The studio is small and the facilities inside seemed quite old. The faucet in the bathroom could not be closed tightly. The sound of dribbling of water was annoying and it was quite a waste of water. (I have known this from the host manual beforehand but could not understand why Sean did not fix it.) The location is too close to Huntington Ave and the noise at night was horrible. The air conditioner did not seem to work properly and was quite noisy. Interestingly we managed to use the noise of the air conditioner as """"white noise"""" to cover the noise from outside so that we had a better sleep at night... 

You got what you paid for. ","Mission Hill"
"28533","Colleen & Joseph were such great hosts. When we arrived Colleen met us at their beautiful loft in the Leather District. They had a bottle of wine, cheese and salami waiting for us, which was so sweet. Colleen was very attentive and helpful. She emailed us an extensive list of restaurants/museums & must see attractions in Boston. The neighborhood was amazing we would absolutely stay there again.. You must get a martini from Seth at the french restaurant/bar Les Zygomates directly across the street from the loft.","Leather District"
"28683","Exceptional hostess, apartment, and location, for a fantastic price!","Leather District"
"15571","Positive points: this very small flat (definitively for a single) is well situated, very close to a T station linked to downtown in 15mn.
Negative: it requires to be refurbished urgently: very old, numerous failures, electric network outdated and dangerous, but it is also dirty (room and washroom). Sean do not do the minimum after each stays. Additionally, you are not allowed to switch off the old PC, so you have the noise made by the CU all along the night (+ the fridge noise, plus the dropping tap + the roar of the avenue...): don't miss your ear plugs.
I met a stressed Sean 15 mn on arrival and bye-bye. No guest book in the room with key informations and advices...
Sean is not fair enough and do not fulfill the Airbnb minimum requirements. 
The price is good... until you discover the reality.","Mission Hill"
"15738","This room was perfect for me.  I came to Boston to visit my daughter and this place is only a few blocks from her apartment.  
It is exactly as billed.  It's an inexpensive alternative to very expensive hotels in Boston and conveniently located near the T.  An earlier reviewer described it best, it's like staying on the couch of a college student. I'd like to add it's better than that because you're sleeping on a comfy bed and you have your own bathroom! I could have stayed on my daughter's couch but didn't really want to share a bathroom with 4 girls or have to keep their hours.   
This is a student neighborhood so there's a bit more street noise on Friday and Saturday nights.  But the building is very quiet.
Sean was very attentive responding quickly every time I contacted him.

","Mission Hill"
"28653","This is an elegant, spotless loft, perfectly situated in Boston, in a safe quiet building. All amenities provided! ","Leather District"
"28703","Jazz was the best host I could have asked for. She was flexible with my flight delay, and had the place spotless upon arrival. Located in awesome Chinatown; you are a quick cab ride from many great locations. Dealing with Jazz made my first Boston experience all the better. I would highly recommend anyone looking for a great spot to stay in Boston to give Jazz a shout!","Leather District"
"25423","The hosts were very friendly and helpful. They work from home so they are home all the time, but they were respectful of my privacy. Neighborhood was a little rough, but it's close to the T and I didn't have any problems. The biggest downside to staying here; there are no keys! For the most part, this is not an issue, unless it is. I had an instance where it was extremely inconvenient/frustrating, and almost scuttled the work portion of my work-cation. Also, I had one morning where I needed to be up early and the hosts were playing video games loudly until early in the morning. I asked them to keep it down, and they did get a little quieter, but sucks to have to ask. If you are planning to live on the hosts schedule, or don't really care about your schedule, this place is comfortable. If your time is not flexible, you may want to keep looking.","Mission Hill"
"15593","Sean was on time and very helpful. Location is great, very close to subway and city center. Building is very old and room/bed could have been cleaner. Overall it was a great stay, I would consider staying there again. Thanks Sean!","Mission Hill"
"15700.1","We stayed at the apartment for one night. Sean was helpful and accurate in the information provided, although we did not meet. At the time of booking we were aware of the small size of the study and mattress left on the floor (learned from previous reviews); the only positive aspect that we found was the proximity to public transportation.
The apartment was awfully dirty: stained mattress cover and probably unwashed, half an inch of dust everywhere, from shutters to tables and kitchen. On the floor of the bathroom we found several hairs, half-finished bars of soap and detergents that probably dated back to a few years ago. From the ceiling dangled the smoke detector. Finally, the noise coming from the street was rather annoying.
Concluding this apartment does not reflect the photos presented on AirBNB, as already reported by other users. Boston is expensive, so we opted for this solution (relying on the photos and on some good reviews). Certainly We didn't expect a hotel service but certainly not the situation in which we found ourselves. We wouldn't recommend this experience to anyone.
","Mission Hill"
"28650","I loved staying at Jazz's airy, modern loft apartment! I really enjoyed meeting and hanging out with Jazz -- she is super sweet and thoughtful. She's highly knowledgeable about Boston and happy to help in any way she can. The location couldn't have been more convenient for me. It's a quick walk from South Station and about a 20 minute walk to the Convention Center, where I had to be for an expo. I will definitely stay here again if I ever need to be in Boston! Oh, and I am obsessed with the pillowy, soft bed and sheets! Had great sleep. ","Leather District"
"28654","Best property I stayed in while in the states. Clean, very close to public transport. Only briefly met Jazz but she was very friendly and helpful. Will definitely stay again if in Boston","Leather District"
"28536","This is a perfect spot for two couples to stay for a few days or more. The location could not be much better – near the center of everything. A major transit hub with an easy connection to the airport is a block away and all of the tourist attractions are within walking distance.
It is a spacious, fully equipped loft conversion with lots of character. There are two large bedrooms with very comfortable beds that share a full bath, a well equipped kitchen, a half bath and lots of room for relaxing. The pictures of the spaces are accurate, it really is that great.
The hosts are very accommodating and flexible with check in and out times. Complimentary wine, beer and snacks were a nice surprise.
Overall we highly recommend this loft as a great place to stay while exploring Boston.
","Leather District"
"15621","GOOD: 
The AREA is quite nice; there is a little plaza right around the corner that sort of serves as the starting point of your day; any items you may need, you can pick up at the Stop & Shop before heading into the city (twenty minutes by public transit) or wherever you plan on going. 

Sean is very nice; he gave us information about interesting places to visit in the city - less touristy, and more hip and fun and affordable - which was perfect.

BAD:
Lo and behold, there are STILL BED BUG problems. Despite thoroughly checking the mattress and the frame, we woke up the next morning to find a few bugs in plain sight and found more amongst our things. Had to go through the trouble of sanitizing and throwing away everything of ours WHILE ON OUR TRIP so we didn't bring it home (or to the hotel we checked into the next day).

Even aside from the bed bugs, though, the cleanliness of the place was hard to bear. Sean arrived at around the same time as us, and let us into a dirty apartment. He pulled off all the sheets and towels in front of us, piled them up, and put new (albeit still stained) sheets on. His cleaning of the bathroom involved running the sink and letting the water rinse it out. There was NO CLEANING of the toilet, shower, etc. and there were hairs in the shower. There were also dirty dishes left in the sink, which was completely unfathomable to us. We ended up going to the Stop&Shop to pick up cleaning supplies and cleaned the bathroom ourselves just to feel comfortable.

It's a shame to say because Sean himself was great; he was completely understanding about the bed bug scenario and our early checkout. But all that said, the guests should feel comfortable; not have that grimy feeling that stops them from being able to relax in their bed. 

AirBNB's customer service was excellent; they were available to help us the day of, and responded quickly and with care to the situation.

All in all, the low price was not worth the stress and time lost from our vacation. Dish out a couple extra dollars and snag a place with a higher a cleanliness rating.
","Mission Hill"
"28605","This apartment was stunningly beautiful. It was very well located near South Street train station and it was in a safe area near the financial centre. Jazz was a very welcoming host and was keen to make the apartment feel like home straight away. It was immacuately clean and very modern and there was virtual silence for sleeping at night. I would certainly recommend it to others and it would be my number one choice if I ever return to Boston.","Leather District"
"27480.2","I would not recommend staying here.

Location - The apartment was in a good area as far as transit and walking goes.  I didn't have any trouble finding parking on the street and left my car for 2 nights without issue.

Bedroom - The bedroom was tiny.  The picture is just about the entire room.  The apartment is just above a Subway and the smell of bread was extremely strong.  The Subway also plays music starting sometime around 6:00 - 6:30 AM and it woke me up each morning.

Bathroom - The bathroom was shared, which is awkward in some instances but overall not terrible.  Problem is the bathroom was gross.  There was hair everything and a huge clump in the drain that swirled around when I turned the shower on.  I was so grossed out from the shower that I did not even shower the last morning.

Cleanliness - The bedroom was clean but that is it.  I already mentioned the bathroom but the apartment itself wasn't overly clean either.  In the middle of the living room there was a huge rack where the host was drying her pants.  I wouldn't care too much that the place was a bit messy but the host had a rule about no shoes and asked us to wear these ridiculous """"sandals"""" around the place.  

Friendliness - I would not classify the host as friendly.  She wasn't rude but definitely wasn't nice.  Every encounter was awkward.  I asked if I could store my bike on her patio and she just flat refused.  Her patio is quite large and empty.  She just wasn't very accommodating. 

Sleeping - The room was listed as sleeping three but what we found was one """"bed"""" and one air mattress.  The bed was not comfortable and the air mattress is an air mattress.  I would not recommend staying here with more than two guests.

Overall - I would not recommend that you stay here.  I was looking for alternative places to stay as soon as we """"checked in"""" but on such short notice I wasn't able to find anything.  Next time I travel to Boston I will absolutely not considering staying here again no matter the price.  

Final Note - I honestly felt that the profile for this place is borderline false advertising.  The room doesn't really sleep three, it's not cozy at all (it's tiny), it smells of Subway (not in a good way), the host isn't friendly, and the host isn't very accommodating.  If you have a choice, choose to stay elsewhere.","Mission Hill"
"15771","We stayed at Sean's on St Patrick's Day and it was exactly as described and pictured.  He communicated well and made it very easy to check into his place.  The bed was definitely bigger in the picture and quite comfortable.  The apartment was incredibly quiet.  Unfortunately even on the second floor, the T was very loud by about 5:30 in the morning.  If you are sensitive to that sort of thing, you should bring earplugs.  My significant other did and it was a little easier for him to sleep.  We parked in a parking garage about a block down at the eye institute and it cost us $25 for the 24 hour stay.  This place was a great little place to crash while staying in Boston.  Thanks, Sean!","Mission Hill"
"28669","I have nothing bad to say at all about this place OR the host! Jazz was amazing. I was in Boston for a work conference; Jazz was accommodating of my schedule and made it really comfortable. The loft was so beautiful I wish I could have been inside more! Seriously the loft is amazing. But I had a great time exploring Boston and Jazz helped me enjoy it even more by giving me an amazingly comfy bed to enjoy, everything I needed to feel right at home and some awesome advice about how to get around the city.  I would stay with her again and again.","Leather District"

"28677","Jazz was very flexible with my arrival time (3-hr delay due to weather) and was warm and welcoming when I finally found my way. Her space is beautiful--minimalist, elegant, clean and modern--and the bedroom was incredibly cozy.

"28700","The apartment was great. Very clean, spacious and the location in the middle of the city is amazing! You can literally walk everywhere. I felt very much at home there. 
Jazz was a great host. Actually she was more than a big sister/friend than a host to me and we really had a good time together. 

I definitely recommend staying here!","Leather District"
"15801","Avoid this place. It felt like a very run down dorm room in a dirty building. The air conditioning cooled the room but the ball bearings are going so it made loud screeching noises periodically throughout the night. Thankfully I had ear plugs along. The bed """"frame"""" is made with 4 2x4/s holding up the sagging mattress. The sink is not just leaky it is constantly on (hot at that) - an example of what is wrong with this place. This place was steps below the worst motel I have ever stayed in.  I also am bothered by staying in places where after paying I get informed that I should not let anyone in the place know that I am with airbnb - we were afraid the manager, who kept staring at us, would ask questions and kick us out.

"789","I had a long stay there for business (~20 days).  Unfortunately my experience with Sean was not fun.  I will try to review his place in fairness.

Pros:
-The location was perfect. Very close to subway, buses, hubway, stop and shop, walgreens, restaurants and cafe.
-Good price. Based on the location, this low price is very attractive.
-Kitchenette is not gorgeous but has everything you need for simple stuff.  A grill, refrigerator and freezer, microwave (Sean brought it for me), pans, and silver ware.  Espresso machine if you'd like.
-Small but ok room. A Bed, a small sofa, little space to put a suitcase, and kitchenette. That's it.  I put one of my suitcases under the bad.  You have to be creative to find a place to eat and use laptop.

Cons:
-The bath room was nasty. There was no cleaning tools and I wonder when it was cleaned last time.  The bath tub was not draining water very well: it took hours to become empty.  I contacted Sean and asked to fix it.  After 2 weeks or so, Sean came to the room and started a big construction --- breaking the walls and floor around the bath tub and changing the drain pipe.  Not only that I couldn't use the bath tub for several days, this tiny room was cover by dusts, including my foods and bed.  I couldn't accept this conditions, and called Airbnb fro help.  After sending photos, Airbnb understood the situations, refunded for the remaining days, and allowed me to relocate to a nearby hotel by covering some cost for it.  Although Airbnb took care of this incident pretty well, it was a lot of unnecessary hustle during my business trip.
-Wifi was really slow.
-Sean's response to my Emails were slow.  Even after I requested him to change towels and sheets, he didn't respond to most of the time.

Summary:
I had a big trouble with Sean, but now he has fixed the problem with the bath tub.  Is it worth staying now? Maybe.
Airbnb customer service was nice.  It was hard to find contact number (phone number hidden)), but after I explained my troubles their response was generous.

"15613","We reserved this architects live in studio, but we were given the option of staying in a larger apartment as we neared Boston. We met Sean at the larger studio in the north end which was completely unacceptable. It was a basement apartment in poor condition. Now, this may sound picky, but there was no top sheet on the bed. We had pillows, bottom sheet and comforter. After unpacking and realizing that we could not possibly stay in this apartment, we told Sean that we were leaving. He was kind but this apartment was disgusting. After we saw the tub and bathroom we realized we wouldn't feel comfortable bathing our daughter in it. Also, our friends who live in Boston told us that the architects live in studio is located in an area that is hardly safe. We asked, out of curiosity, whether Sean actually owned the two different studios and he told us that he basically manages them for a company. So, it seems somewhat misleading from the apartment posting. They seem like privately owned, by Sean, which gives them a more quaint feel. In the end, airbnb reimbursed us for our stay and sent us an apologetic gift basket. Excellent customer service from airbnb. ","Mission Hill"
"27480","I would not recommend staying here.

Location - The apartment was in a good area as far as transit and walking goes.  I didn't have any trouble finding parking on the street and left my car for 2 nights without issue.

Bedroom - The bedroom was tiny.  The picture is just about the entire room.  The apartment is just above a Subway and the smell of bread was extremely strong.  The Subway also plays music starting sometime around 6:00 - 6:30 AM and it woke me up each morning.

Bathroom - The bathroom was shared, which is awkward in some instances but overall not terrible.  Problem is the bathroom was gross.  There was hair everything and a huge clump in the drain that swirled around when I turned the shower on.  I was so grossed out from the shower that I did not even shower the last morning.

Cleanliness - The bedroom was clean but that is it.  I already mentioned the bathroom but the apartment itself wasn't overly clean either.  In the middle of the living room there was a huge rack where the host was drying her pants.  I wouldn't care too much that the place was a bit messy but the host had a rule about no shoes and asked us to wear these ridiculous """"sandals"""" around the place.  

Friendliness - I would not classify the host as friendly.  She wasn't rude but definitely wasn't nice.  Every encounter was awkward.  I asked if I could store my bike on her patio and she just flat refused.  Her patio is quite large and empty.  She just wasn't very accommodating. 

Sleeping - The room was listed as sleeping three but what we found was one """"bed"""" and one air mattress.  The bed was not comfortable and the air mattress is an air mattress.  I would not recommend staying here with more than two guests.

Overall - I would not recommend that you stay here.  I was looking for alternative places to stay as soon as we """"checked in"""" but on such short notice I wasn't able to find anything.  Next time I travel to Boston I will absolutely not considering staying here again no matter the price.  

Final Note - I honestly felt that the profile for this place is borderline false advertising.  The room doesn't really sleep three, it's not cozy at all (it's tiny), it smells of Subway (not in a good way), the host isn't friendly, and the host isn't very accommodating.  If you have a choice, choose to stay elsewhere.","Mission Hill"
"15649.1","Sean's place was a kind of a disappointment for us. The place is small as described, but that's not the problem. The real issue is the big amount of dirt we found all over the place. The freezer reeks and is so dirty that we found it impossible to use. The location though is awesome. There are plenty of good places to eat around, not to mention there is a train station nearby. The thing is if you're looking for cleaness and a big room thats definetly not the place, but if your budged is low and you're trying to be well located, go for it.

"15661","Just stayed this past weekend with a buddy and had a great time. Apartment is as small as it looks but I went to Boston to enjoy the city, not stay in the room!

"23774","Three of us stayed at Alexandra's apartment this past weekend and we found it very conveniently close to the green T line. The apartment was clean and modern, but we didn't love the smell of the Subway that is right below. The room is simple with thin mattresses, and it had bunk beds rather than twin beds. Pictures online should be updated. Overall, Alexandra is welcoming and accommodating even though the room is not the most comfortable. ","Mission Hill"
"15634","I have to echo Daniel's words here - Sean's a nice guy and the apartment is mostly as described.... BUT 
... I got badly bitten by BUGS - probably overnight. It looks like a previous problem may not have been resolved. I'm one of those people who react to bites (canary in a coalmine).
There was one real twin mattress and an airbed that did not fit on the frame; so I used that on the floor.

Plus side:
Clean enough, nice location, handy for the T, good coffee shop round the corner. Cotton sheets!

*Might* stay in another of Sean's places if it had a bug free certificate.","Mission Hill"

The condo is centrally located and within walking distance to much of the city.  Jazz recommended a few things that helped us get to know the city, and they were spot on. The Duck Tour is a must, just make sure to call ahead to see if there are seats left.","Leather District"

Cobblestone streets, the China district....The Subway was easy to get to and navigate.

"16508","My family was looking for a special space to spend the weekend together in Boston -- this space was PERFECT. Nicolas was a terrific host. He communicated quickly and was very accommodating. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals (Nicolas emptied his fridge for us), there were plenty of towels and linens, plenty of closet space, comfy beds, and the bathroom had many amenities (shampoo, lotion, hair dryer.) The location made things so easy: grocery store and parking garage across the street, and Chinatown with all it's delicious bakeries and restaurants was 5 minutes away.

My college-age daughter and I could not have been happier in our own loft situated in the heart of Boston. Easy to get around, great Vietnamese restaurants out our door, secure, safe building.

You can indeed walk everywhere or take public transportation if you're getting tired. The bedroom is small but adequate and comfortable. At some point I would love to rent the entire loft!

"863","I was told the place would be ready by 1:00 a week in advance. Then I was told that morning that it wouldn't be ready until 4:30. Got there after 4:30 while I waited around Boston for three hours (since I was already driving there by the time he decided to let me know it wouldn't be ready) and he was still """"cleaning."""" The room needs an entire makeover, not a vacuum. The place is a small, dank, old, oversized closet with a wooden plank that has an extremely dirty mattress (big stains all over it) sitting on top of wooden boards. You hear every noise in the hallway and in the street and there's a horrible odor on the sheets and throughout the apartment. On my way out, he had stranded the next guests out in the rain!! I had to pass them my key because lucky for them, I was just leaving... Otherwise, those people too would have waited around Boston for him to """"clean"""" and let them in.

"15713","Wir hatten eine gute Zeit bei Sean.

Die Schluesseluebergabe erfolgte nicht persoenlich sondern ueber eine lockbox, was den Vorteil hat, dass man unabhaengig von der Ankunftszeit in die Wohnung kann.

Zugegeben war der erste Eindruck, wenn man die Wohnung betritt, nicht der Beste, da das Studio und die Einrichtung nicht das/ die Neueste ist/ sind. Allerdings hat sich der Eindruck innerhalb kuerzester Zeit verfluechtigt! Alles hat problemlos funktioniert und wir haben uns in den 4 Tagen sehr wohl gefuehlt. 

Die Nachbarschaft und Umgebung war gut; wir haben uns jederzeit sicher gefuehlt.

Ausserdem hat das Studio eine gute Anbindung an die T (Tram und Ubahn in Boston).

Alles in allem trifft die Beschreibung von Sean zu 100% zu und wir koennen ihn und das Studio auf alle Faelle weiterempfehlen!

"882.1","I never met Sean. I was only in touch with him through Phone and text messaging.  The place is a good location, a bed, and a tiny tiny bathroom and shower.  Everything about this listing is cheap cheap cheap.  The blinds on the windows fall as soon as you touch them, the bed was assembled with plywood, and the mattress has very little spring in it.  The cups and dishes were covered in dust and there was no obvious sponge to clean them, so I just ate out or bought prepared food.  He did leave me linens and towels.  Also, the window doesn't close well so it can get quite cold in the winter when I visited.  Nothing unsafe or dishonest about this apartment just definitely not luxury.","Mission Hill"
"28601","This is a great place. Very clean, ideal location close by to downtown and the new Boston Convention Center, comfortable bed, clean linens, WiFi, plus a wonderful host. I would strongly recommend it to any fellow traveler.","Leather District"

"15798","Sean was prompt in answering phone calls, though he seemed not to be reading SMS and emails. So contact him by phone calls. 

Pros: The place was overall clean. The location is very convenient and close to the Green Line and many shops. The fridge and the microwave oven worked properly. 

Cons: The studio is small and the facilities inside seemed quite old. The faucet in the bathroom could not be closed tightly. The sound of dribbling of water was annoying and it was quite a waste of water. (I have known this from the host manual beforehand but could not understand why Sean did not fix it.) The location is too close to Huntington Ave and the noise at night was horrible. The air conditioner did not seem to work properly and was quite noisy. Interestingly we managed to use the noise of the air conditioner as """"white noise"""" to cover the noise from outside so that we had a better sleep at night...

"12939.1","I stayed in the flat of Yosef for two times over a couple of days in December 2014. It was a very clean, comfortable and well located place near Mission Hill with only 1 min. to go to the next tram/subway station (green line). Yosef and his roommate were perfect, very welcoming hosts, providing detail instructions prior to check in. I would go there anytime again.
Im Dezember 2014 wohnte ich (53, erste Erfahrung mit airbnb) zweimal für mehrere Tage in der Wohnung von Yosef und James. Yosef war in dieser Zeit bei seinen Eltern und ich wohnte in seinem Zimmer, was, wie die gesamte Wohnung, sehr sauber und komfortabel war. Die Lage nahe Mission Hill und die kurze Entfernung zur nächsten Straßenbahnhaltestelle (green line) waren perfekt, auch für Ausflüge in das Stadtzentrum.
Die Kommunikation vorab war schnell und ausführlich und das Einchecken absolut unproblematisch. Yosef und sein Mitbewohner James waren perfekte, freundliche und angenehme Gastgeber.
Bei meinem nächsten Aufenthalt in Boston würde ich diese Wohngelegenheit auf jeden Fall einem Hotel vorziehen und würde gerne wieder bei Yosef und James wohnen.

"848","The apartment is very easy to get to. It's 200 feet from the Fenwood St. stop on the green E line, and Sean gives you very clear instructions for getting in. The apartment itself was clean, and had everything I needed for my trip(including an iron!). It's a REALLY small space. I'm 5' 11"""" and found it hard to shower. Definitely wouldn't recommend it for anyone who is really tall or has issues in tight spaces.

I never met Sean, but he was responsive and helpful throughout the process. I had to come in a day late than I anticipated and there were no problems. Seems like a nice guy, I'd stay at one of his spaces again.","Mission Hill"
"28636","Jazz was a great host and her place was clean, comfortable and looked great. The location is very convenient to the South Station train and bus terminal. I would certainly stay there again.","Leather District"
"28627","By far the best accommodations and service I've had the pleasure of experiencing through AirBnB.  The loft was immaculate, the room (which I worried would feel like a shoebox) was spacious with possibly the most comfortable bed I've slept on, amenities are top notch, and the location can't be beat.  Jazz followed all of this up with great communication throughout.  I look forward to my next trip to Boston, and if I'm lucky, another stay here.","Leather District"
"864","Sean was immediately reply to my massage. And he's very kind. But the bathroom is too small. I was frustrated. Water did not come out well.","Mission Hill"
"16516","This loft is wonderful. There are two really lovely bedrooms and one very comfortable bathroom. The common area is completely open but so large that it doesn't feel in any way cramped. The apartment is beautifully decorated. The kitchen is perfect. We stayed here with our two young children, and both of them completely enjoyed the kids' room which was full of basic toys and books to keep them completely occupied. Although we were considerate of the amount of noise we were making, the building is so large and seemingly sound proof that I doubt anyone heard us. We also could barely hear people in the surrounding apartments. 
The building is on a corner a block from the Chinatown entrance, so we strolled there in the evening. It is also two blocks the other way from South Station. We also walked 15 minutes or so to the Children's Museum, which was tons of fun. For adult travelers there are restaurants and many places that you can either walk or easily take the T or a cab too. And this place is perfect if you're coming into town on a train and working in the financial district. On our last evening we invited a few friends for Chinese takeout and the space was very comfortable for them for a small informal dinner. (It would also be AMAZING for a small formal dinner, btw--but alas we've got two leprechauns.)  We would definitely stay there again. 
The only challenge—but this is the case just about anywhere in the city—was loading and unloading the car. Thank god for the elevator!
Finally, the owners were a true pleasure to deal with. They answered quickly, responded to any of our concerns, were courteous and flexible. The whole experience was, quite frankly, perfect. ","Leather District"
"41612","Tout était parfait! Le quartier est très sympa, calme et proche des transports (5 min de la station et 30min de downtown). Les hôtes sont adorables, très prévenants et accueillants.

Nous recommandons fortement de contacter Carl car c'est réellement une des meilleures place où loger sur boston!!","Mission Hill"
"786","If you're looking for a quiet place with clean sheets to spend the night, this will work, in a bare-light-bulb, monk's closet sort of way.

The room is postage-stamp tiny.  There's a double bed against the wall, and floor space for (barely) two suitcases.  If the two occupants of the bed retire or rise at different times, there's lots of climbing over each other in the dark.

Aesthetically, the place is a dump.  Electric plates hanging off the wall, curtain tied in a knot to keep it away from the window a/c, cardboard inserts on either side of the a/c. The bathroom is the worst: missing tiles on the floor, one soap dish broken off, mirror cracked, mildew around the tub which does not drain during a shower.  And the hot water cut off twice while showering.

Also there was only one key, so the two of us were constantly in communication about who had the key and who couldn't get back into the apartment until the other arrived.

But as I say, if you just need to spend the night in a quiet place that's near all the hospitals for less than $100, this will work.

"15767.1","I hate to leave a negative review, but after many Airbnb experiences, this one left a bit to be desired. The entrance key was not left behind for me; the previous guests hadn’t left it as they should have, but the host hadn’t ensured it was there, which wasn't the best way to welcome a guest if anything goes wrong. In the end, I waited an hour and a half outside the building, to the point that neighbors offered to let me in and asked if I was ok. I would have gone for a coffee or lunch to avoid loitering, but Sean told me he was coming shortly.  I had very little time to spend in Boston, and though Sean responded fairly quickly, he didn’t come for an hour. While Sean seemed like a nice, laid-back guy who tried to accommodate me and did apologize (a little), he seemed somewhat oblivious to the fact that this was kind of a big bummer and really threw my plans off.  When I realized there was no key, I asked Sean to call me so we could sort it all that way quickly, but he only texted and sent Airbnb messages, which wasn’t easy to handle in the cold on my phone , and I guess that made me feel like he was avoiding a conversation, which would have been reassuring. Upon entering the apartment late in the afternoon with him once he arrived (3pm, check in was about 1pm), I can’t lie; the place was pretty dirty, had an odor, and at that point I was a bit exasperated. To Sean’s credit, after I returned in the evening and he had changed the sheets and cleaned, it was better. (Sorry! As someone else mentioned, I think the place needs a deep clean and a bit of maintenance to be truly ready for guests--I understand the apartment is old and I don't care about that a bit, but that doesn't mean it can't be cleaned and maintained in a caring way, and I would feel a bit bad renting a place in this shape. It looks rougher than the pictures.) On the plus side: the apartment was the perfect temperature, it's conveniently located by the green line, the kitchenette is useful, wifi was fine, and Sean was really nice to bring a bike over for me that I felt badly I couldn't use in the end due to limited time and more snow. I get that things happen, and this is one way to do an Airbnb rental (minimal maintenance and a full guest list based on a good city location), but I would have appreciated a little more, “Sorry once again about the big hiccup getting in, I really apologize for that and will look into a better system so it doesn’t happen again!,” instead of him inquiring whether I’d returned the key (of course I did after my experience! :) )-- that would have gone a long way.

"10129.2","THIS place was TERRIBLE and DOES not meet minimum cleanliness standards.

Joshua was not upfront that there are 5 other people leaving in that APT. Also he did not tell me that he does not live there any more. Basically he was subletting the place and I was not informed of this. 

The place is really Dark and very badly maintained by these 2o year old college kids. There was one bathroom used by all the five 5 roommates and it was nasty as hell. The other bathroom was on a different floor and the plumbing was broken. The bathrooms were not cleaned for months, as I could see rolls or used toilet paper and empty shampoo bottles with sticky floor. 

Since Joshua doe not live there and was a surprise for me, I was not comfortable staying with these people, and compete for the nastiest bathroom. I tried tried taking the shower and the water would not drain and my whole body started itching for the whole day with red rashes. 

I basically vacated the place without staying for a night, even though I reserved for 2 weeks.

I do not recommend this place for any one as this does not meet the cleanness standards or a place you would have to pay so much. Description does not meet what I say there.

Worst part the kitchen and the washing room were so dark and nasty with lots of Trash from almost 3 months lying all over the APT. I could even smell POT all over the place. There were cigarette buds 100's of them all over the APT, bathroom, kitchen etc.
","Mission Hill"
"820","In short, you get what you pay for. Very affordable price for an older, one-room studio. Towels, sheets, and blanket were provided and clean. Bathroom is tiny (to California standards) but the water is hot and plenty, and we had no issues with plumbing/toilet. There was a mini-fridge which was really nice to have during our stay. The bed itself was comfortable enough, but there were times I thought we were going to break the frame while sleeping! Maybe we ate too much while in Boston!

I will say that you can't beat this location. It was literally a 30 second walk to the train/bus stop and that made it really easy for us to get around Boston and even come back in the middle of the day to get some rest. 

Overall, if you don't mind a no-frills and very affordable place to stay, this is it. Being from California, I wasn't used to the small space and older buildings, so it took some time to get used to everything, but overall, can't complain. ","Mission Hill"
"28642","Had a GREAT with Jazz!!! Location was excellent… South Station is literally just down the street, making connections to everywhere super easy.  Easy walking distance to all of Boston.. Back Bay, Financial, Boston Common and garden; and Chinatown at your doorstep!  Fab.
The place was a scrupulously clean, interesting loft in a secure elevator building. High ceilings, exposed brick and wood beams, hardwood floors, and, as a bonus, well chosen artwork!!  Very cool vibe.  The bedroom was outfitted with a really comfortable queen bed with good quality linens and down comforter, and plenty of extra blankets and pillows. Good size room that easily accommodates 2.
Bathroom, shared, was so clean it seemed new :-)  Plenty of towels and space! 

Jazz was a pleasure to chat with! Very easy going.  In fact, my travel plans were thrown into a tailspin, and she was very flexible and gracious in accommodating my needs.

Overall, this was a 5 star plus stay.  Wished they were all this good!!!

"28659","This place is a jewel! Just a few minutes walk from the South Station, the connections are really excellent all over town. It is an elegant and a super clean loft - could be in any interior decoration magazine. Jazz is a wonderful host, generous, an example of hospitality, making a huge effort for the guest to feel at home and have a good time, making coffee, offering snacks, tips and advice. She is energetic and positive, in a few hours it feels as if you had known her for years. It was a pleasure to stay at her place and to get to know her! Warmly recommended. ","Leather District"
"15551","The apartment was functional for my needs. Very small but that wasn't a surprise as it was advertised that way. The bathroom was a bit grotty due to the age of the building (ie tiles loose on the floor, stains in the sink and mildue on wall tiles) but thats part and parcel of some of these older style apartments. Given the outrageous prices for Hotels in this city this apartment proved to be a big money saver for me. Sean was helpful when I needed to ask a question and check in and check out were conducted without any dramas. If you like roughing it to save dollars like I do then this is a great option. If you are a bit precious about things and need everything to be spotless and sparkling white then maybe u might consider other options. Transport options were good with a tram to downtown being only a block away. Excellent options everywhere around the neighborhood for eating out. Thanks Sean.","Mission Hill"
"16498","This is a really terrific apartment and I would absolutely stay here again.  The location is super convenient to drive into, the parking lot is super close so for me, having driven into Boston, it was nice to have a a place to securely leave my car (I uber'd everwhere).

Plus there is a 24 hour diner around the block, so when the 3 of us who stayed there came in at 3:30am,  we were able to go grab a bite, making the morning meetings much more manageable.

"834","Booking was simple and straightforward, and Sean made it easy and convenient for me to check in, even though I was arriving quite late. He was prompt and friendly. The apartment was a bargain- it is hard to find a such a cheap place that isn't a shared space, especially so close to the hospital area. That said, it was a fair price for what I got: a small studio with basic kitchen, pretty clean, but in need of some love here and there. The bathroom was a bit run down, and the apartment door needed replacing. The building is okay, not great, and there was a fire alarm with a dead battery beeping down the hall all night. It is a bit of a sketchy neighbourhood, not dangerous, but not the best place to arrive alone late at night. However, it is very central and convenient to most of Boston.","Mission Hill"

However; I think it's way over priced I paid 6k for a one month stay and had to pay extra for parking . The whole building smells so bad. It takes forever to get on the elevator and when you do finally get on one you're like a sardine with 8 Indians from India or Arabs.
There was a sewage leak in the hallway for like 5 days.
For the amount of money I paid you'd think that you would have a washer or dryer but no. Also The bed was extremely uncomfortable. And college kids on the floor were loud most nights! 
Looking back i should've booked a hotel. It would've cost the same for a much pleasant experience.

The appartment was clean, near the subway station, and included some tips about where to go in the neighborhood.
If I had to say one negative thing would be the noise when upstairs neighbors are going out/coming in the building.
Other that, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend to anyone, thanks Steven!","Mission Hill"
"13219","Matt is a good guy. Welcoming and made sure everything was set up. Nice place in a great neighborhood. 2 minute walk from South Station. Lots of stuff to do nearby. 

Was in town for a convention with a colleague of mine. There are two full baths, one is attached to a bedroom, the other is not. This worked out fine for us, just an FYI to those who might be doing the same in the future.

"15600.2","I'm hesitant to give this 2 stars -- I'd like to give it one or none -- because I got BED BUGS from this place!  But I have to be fair and say that the location and convenience are great; it's super close to the T, great point from which to explore Boston and restaurants and shops close by. Also, Sean was accommodating and helpful; he brought us more bedding when we needed it and also let us keep our bags in the studio for a few hours past check out time on the day we left so that we wouldn't have to traipse through Boston with them.  BUT, and it's a big BUT, this place feels like it hasn't had a good cleaning in years.  There is dust everywhere and worst of all, the mold was THICK in the bathroom.  So bad and so nasty that I went out and bought tile cleaner and cleaned the thing myself!  When Sean came by (to drop the bedding) he noticed I had cleaned and said something about oh, it'll just be back because there isn't ventilation.  Um, no, it won't come back if you clean regularly.  He also said something along the lines of, well, that's why it's not $200 a night.  Again, no.  I don't care how much I'm paying, I expect a clean and healthy place -- and mold in every crevice of the bathroom is just plain disgusting and unhealthy.  There are also missing tiles in the bathroom floor and some are coming up.  I took pictures of all this by the way, because I couldn't believe it. I wouldn't care so much about that if -- again -- I felt that the bathroom floor had been properly scrubbed in the last year or so.  But whatever, I could get over all that -- it's the BED BUGS I'm mad about.  Lo and behold I come home and to dozens -- maybe hundreds? -- of bites all over my body.  I'd post pictures but they are rather gross. It takes a few days for them to appear so I didn't realize it till after I left, because believe me, otherwise I would have called Sean and AirBnB and demanded a new place to stay.  So yeah, here I am at home, now frantically washing all my clothes and linens.  So if the place were cleaned and exterminated, I'd give it a 3 or 4 (it is very small) but as is, I'd say go somewhere else!","Mission Hill"
"19297","This was a very short notice and short stay so I am grateful to Fernando and Victor's flexibility in hosting me. The room is small and on a basement which is dark (as all basements are) there's a lot of loud noises. The fan is loud, the pipes are loud, etc so do bring ear plugs. The location is unbeatable, though! The bus and tram stop right in front of the place and run from very early to very late (I took a 4:30 AM bus to the airport on a Saturday). ","Mission Hill"
"12310","Veronica was great to deal with, prompt in her replies.  The apartment is small and has everything you need, as advertised.

There is no air conditioning in the unit and it was very uncomfortable on the hot days.  The apartment could also use a very thorough cleaning.  Cable was not available in the unit which was disappointing.  The bed was also very uncomfortable, I think it was a double bed on a queen frame.  

That said, it was the cheapest option in the area, so I think it's a get what you pay for scenario.","Mission Hill"
"8524","Josh's place was nice and easy to find. The best part of the room was the keyboard (am a piano player so loved it). Bathrooms weren't clean at all which was a big disappointment. I didn't get to meet the host personally but it was very quiet since most of the time no one would be home. I choose the place for its location. Room was clean. Thank you Josh for hosting us.","Mission Hill"
"15767.2","I hate to leave a negative review, but after many Airbnb experiences, this one left a bit to be desired. The entrance key was not left behind for me; the previous guests hadn’t left it as they should have, but the host hadn’t ensured it was there, which wasn't the best way to welcome a guest if anything goes wrong. In the end, I waited an hour and a half outside the building, to the point that neighbors offered to let me in and asked if I was ok. I would have gone for a coffee or lunch to avoid loitering, but Sean told me he was coming shortly.  I had very little time to spend in Boston, and though Sean responded fairly quickly, he didn’t come for an hour. While Sean seemed like a nice, laid-back guy who tried to accommodate me and did apologize (a little), he seemed somewhat oblivious to the fact that this was kind of a big bummer and really threw my plans off.  When I realized there was no key, I asked Sean to call me so we could sort it all that way quickly, but he only texted and sent Airbnb messages, which wasn’t easy to handle in the cold on my phone , and I guess that made me feel like he was avoiding a conversation, which would have been reassuring. Upon entering the apartment late in the afternoon with him once he arrived (3pm, check in was about 1pm), I can’t lie; the place was pretty dirty, had an odor, and at that point I was a bit exasperated. To Sean’s credit, after I returned in the evening and he had changed the sheets and cleaned, it was better. (Sorry! As someone else mentioned, I think the place needs a deep clean and a bit of maintenance to be truly ready for guests--I understand the apartment is old and I don't care about that a bit, but that doesn't mean it can't be cleaned and maintained in a caring way, and I would feel a bit bad renting a place in this shape. It looks rougher than the pictures.) On the plus side: the apartment was the perfect temperature, it's conveniently located by the green line, the kitchenette is useful, wifi was fine, and Sean was really nice to bring a bike over for me that I felt badly I couldn't use in the end due to limited time and more snow. I get that things happen, and this is one way to do an Airbnb rental (minimal maintenance and a full guest list based on a good city location), but I would have appreciated a little more, “Sorry once again about the big hiccup getting in, I really apologize for that and will look into a better system so it doesn’t happen again!,” instead of him inquiring whether I’d returned the key (of course I did after my experience! :) )-- that would have gone a long way.

"28603","What a great place and great host! Very accommodating and friendly and would definitely recommend to future guests!","Leather District"
"15700","We stayed at the apartment for one night. Sean was helpful and accurate in the information provided, although we did not meet. At the time of booking we were aware of the small size of the study and mattress left on the floor (learned from previous reviews); the only positive aspect that we found was the proximity to public transportation.
The apartment was awfully dirty: stained mattress cover and probably unwashed, half an inch of dust everywhere, from shutters to tables and kitchen. On the floor of the bathroom we found several hairs, half-finished bars of soap and detergents that probably dated back to a few years ago. From the ceiling dangled the smoke detector. Finally, the noise coming from the street was rather annoying.
Concluding this apartment does not reflect the photos presented on AirBNB, as already reported by other users. Boston is expensive, so we opted for this solution (relying on the photos and on some good reviews). Certainly We didn't expect a hotel service but certainly not the situation in which we found ourselves. We wouldn't recommend this experience to anyone.
","Mission Hill"
"909"," To start with, the description was misleading along with the photos posted. We could not spend a single night staying there and were forced to find accommodation elsewhere. As we are students, we do not have much money and had budgeted our entire trip and this set us back quite a lot of money. We wish to highlight this almost fraudulent behavior. We had to lodge an official complaint with both air bnb and the host in question. The room was much smaller then the photos led to believe. It advertised that it had a kitchen with facilities however the kitchen was a cubby hole with a plug in hob balancing on a fridge. The hob also looked unsafe to use and there was no sink for use except for the In the bathroom. This is disgraceful and action should be taken for future users of this site. The bed was self made and looked unsafe in structure,  the sheets were not changed after we arrived and the host proceeded to let himself in without knocking knowing we were there. This felt very intrusive. The room itself was not too a good standard.  It advertised you could fit two to three people where one person alone where a tight fit in reality.
As we had issues getting in contact with the host in the first place to inform him when woulf arrive, we could not contact him to inform him we would not be staying there.","Mission Hill"

It's a beautiful home, extremely comfortable, and was a perfect place to stay for me and two colleagues.

"23760","This place's advantage is near T.. that's it. This room is only good for spring or summer NOT winter i guess, because of heater inside of room. Every ten minutes? or twenty minutes there was sound of heater.. it was disaster. If there was no heater, its gonna be freezing inside. Also, this room has a bunk not like a picture. Moreover, if you want to fine a more friendly host.. you should fine another place to stay. My mom and I just stayed here for two days out of a week and changed the place to Sharaton hotel in Boston. I was really disappointed both this place and Airbnb as well.

"15785","We hesitated a lot before writing this comment because we fand Sean really nice and kind: we met him upon our arrival as he was finishing preparing our flat. The bed sheets and towels have been changed. The first impression of the flat was that we have been trapped!!!
The appartment is definitly is a very bad shape and shall be completly refurbished: questionnable electrical installation (cables repaired with band,...), broken stores, ceiling in the bathroom almost falling down, ventilator in the bathroom also broken. The bed was even funny : the feet are composed of 2 superimposed shoe pairs on one side and a rechargeable battery on the other (!). But okay, what do you expect for this price ? This was indeed not was shocked us with this flat.
The worst part was the dirt. And even for such a price you can expect the flat to be cleaned !!! The floor was full of dust and of hairs (different sizes and colors so it was probably not only from the former guest unless they've lived with 5 people here).
The bathroom was covered with moisture, the electrical plate and the oven were black with dirt, the fridge had brown motives made of a fluid which one fell on it, the walls and the doors were covered with traces of liquid which made flowing motives when drying.

It's within walking distance to everything: BCEC, Seaport area, Chinatown, the red and silver transit line (which take you directly to the airport, downtown, Harvard, Cambridge, south Boston). Plus, it's nestled in an area that isn't too busy, so you don't have to deal with noise and traffic.

As a host, Jazz was amazing. She gave a lot of details about the area upon our arrival, including restaurants, pubs, shops and transit. Plus, she gave us the space and privacy we needed during out stay. Super nice and very accommodating. 

What are you waiting for? Seriously. Stay here, you won't regret it!","Leather District"
"891","I came to this listing knowing it would be a small, cozy apartment almost like a student dorm with a small private bathroom. What I didn't expect was how filthy it was. First off, the location is awesome. It is in an area near a ton of universities and right around the corner are plenty of food places and a couple of bars. It's right next to the E-Train so you have access everywhere! There is even a grocery store and pharmacy a block away. I would of had a more positive experience if the apartment wasn't filthy. I checked in early and the previous tenant's used towel and linens were still in the room. I checked in early at noon instead of 1, so I didn't mind. The house manual says that Sean comes in about one time per day to change linens, around 3PM. I left for the day to return around 6PM and the room still had not been cleaned so I contacted our host who said he was unavailable to come at the moment. He ended up coming by later that night around 10:30PM after some pleading and changed the linen and the towels. The room had clean linen now, but the room was still dirty. There was a lot of dust, stains of dried sticky liquid accumulated with dirt under the bed, and the bathroom had bugs. Several bugs would show up in the bathroom and rest on the towels. When he came in that first night, he didn't clean the floors or the shower floor and with the addition of bugs in the bathroom, I did not feel comfortable and ended up not showering for the duration of my stay. I told Sean about the bugs and he said he """"was sorry I had to see that"""" and blamed it on the missing tiles which he said he was going to come in the next day to fix, which he did not. Later, there was a discrepancy with the lock box which I wanted to notify him about and he responded by insulting another tenant. Honestly, although he was very nice in person, I think he may have too much on his plate and is in turn neglecting his duties as a host on AirBnB and would therefore not recommend staying with him at all.","Mission Hill"
"28608","The pictures do not justice to how amazing this space it, and how convenient it is to everything.  Jazz is fantastic host, as well.

"36897.1","The apartment is accurately shown in photos. Ann was good to work with. A friend and I shared the place for a week.

Pros:
***Great location (5-10 minute walk to LMA; two T lines within 4 blocks; 2 T stops from MFA; supermarket, drugstore, and many places to get food nearby.
—Resides on a lovely, quiet street.
—Good amount of space, with separate dining area, and even a porch if you're there in the right weather.
—Two full baths (one quite large), one with bathtub. 
—Great water pressure; hot water plentiful.
—Nice linens.
—Good internet connection.
—Quiet.

Cons:
—Place needs updating. Master bed is small and sags in middle, many of the chairs sag, place is dusty and needs thorough cleaning and new paint job, as well as weeding out of kitchen drawers and cupboards. (It's not that the place is dirty, it's just that there is too much stuff in it, much of it old and not in the best condition. It's a bit like living in a used furniture shop; just the far side of eclectic.)
—Located up a steep Amsterdamesque staircase with no landing outside door. Not a good option for anyone with mobility or vertigo issues.
—If you plan to use sofa bed, ask Ann to bring an air mattress. She provided that for us, which was much appreciated.
—Cost a bit high for condition.

Having said that, I would probably stay there again as I found it overall comfortable and very convenient.","Mission Hill"

"10129.1","THIS place was TERRIBLE and DOES not meet minimum cleanliness standards.

Joshua was not upfront that there are 5 other people leaving in that APT. Also he did not tell me that he does not live there any more. Basically he was subletting the place and I was not informed of this. 

The place is really Dark and very badly maintained by these 2o year old college kids. There was one bathroom used by all the five 5 roommates and it was nasty as hell. The other bathroom was on a different floor and the plumbing was broken. The bathrooms were not cleaned for months, as I could see rolls or used toilet paper and empty shampoo bottles with sticky floor. 

Since Joshua doe not live there and was a surprise for me, I was not comfortable staying with these people, and compete for the nastiest bathroom. I tried tried taking the shower and the water would not drain and my whole body started itching for the whole day with red rashes. 

I basically vacated the place without staying for a night, even though I reserved for 2 weeks.

I do not recommend this place for any one as this does not meet the cleanness standards or a place you would have to pay so much. Description does not meet what I say there.

Worst part the kitchen and the washing room were so dark and nasty with lots of Trash from almost 3 months lying all over the APT. I could even smell POT all over the place. There were cigarette buds 100's of them all over the APT, bathroom, kitchen etc.

"28531","eBay Version: Great location, great host, nice loft, highly recommend!

Deets:  Joe's loft is in the leather district, a small neighborhood between Chinatown and South Station.  It is very conveniently located; trains, cabs and the T one block away at the train station (not to mention Regina's Pizza, some of Boston's best!), easy access to I90 and I93, and walking distance via the nearby Greenway to Faneuil Hall and the North End.  This isn't Beacon Hill or Newbury Street, but there are plenty of good restaurants in easy walking distance (including Five Guys down the block and a great French place practically right across the street), and a convenience store and 24 hour diner very nearby.

Joe himself is a great host.  He has been very active over the years in the Airbnb community, so he knows exactly what his guests expect.  He met me to hand off the keys, and gave me a thorough walk through of the loft; and did a great job.

The loft is not super fancy, but very functional, attractive, clean and well laid out.  It is Joe's residence, not a dedicated Airbnb, but Joe did a great job of providing me with a clean, uncluttered space.  He left out the right things (completely outfitted kitchen, etc.) and put away the rest of his stuff.  The kitchen is excellent, with great appliances, and a really nice bar with stools.  The pool table is a beautiful old monster, the sofa in the living room is wonderfully soft leather, and there is lots of natural light.

It is a third floor walk-up, so keep that in mind if you have heavy bags.  The neighborhood was very quiet at night, and the bedroom is interior (not against the outside wall), so I slept very well indeed.

In summary, I would definitely recommend Joe's loft as a great place to stay in downtown Boston; and I would stay there again myself in a heartbeat.","Leather District"

"899","If I could give Sean a 0, I would. I wouldn't recommend this stay to anyone given the hassle it was for us to stay the night. First of all, if you have questions when you arrive don't expect him to answer his phone or respond in any way. When we arrived we had to drive around for two hours trying to find parking, I had to ask 3 locals where was appropriate to park for that apartment because he did not respond. After finally getting a parking spot, it being 10pm, we followed his instructions to get the key but the key was not where it should have been. He asked us to drive to him to get the key after finding the parking spot. We had to wait for Sean to bike a half hour to give us the key, we didn't get in till 11. The room was decent but the bathroom was much smaller than expected, and could use a good scrub. 
*ALSO, at 10am a couple walked right into our room because they also had a key to our room, and later when we returned to get our things they were in our room again. 
Terrible stay. ","Mission Hill"
"828","We don't met Sean during our short stay in the studio. There is a system of keybox to have the keys, this is a good point.
The studio could be a nice place: its located near the subway, there is A\C, hot water, a small kitchen with microwave...
Despite these positives points, this was not à good expérience... The bathroom needs some works, specially 
the bath who is very worn. The bed is bad, it make à lot of noise and the matress is uncomfortable.
To sumarise, if you want to spend few night in Boston and you search something not too expensive, it could be ok. But if you want à nice place, or if you have surplus budget, i don't recommend it.","Mission Hill"
"15729.1","Communication with Sean was very good and helpful, we did not have any problems to find the apartment and get into it. The Apartment itself was disappointing: extremely small and run down and somewhat shabby, especially the bathroom. Bed is very uncomfortable and too small for two. The photos are very well made... And one needs earplugs as the busy street is very close and the neighbourhood is loud.
Good: Towels, conveniently located and the breakfast place around the corner.","Mission Hill"
"15477","The apartment covers all of the basics but being that it's a tiny studio it definitely had some space issues for two people. Sean was awesome, even met us early on Saturday morning after our red-eye flight. The apartment is just over a block from a T stop and the local spots: Penguin Pizza, JP Licks and such are awesome!  The only downside was the age of the building and the fact that Sean wasn't able to clean it before we arrived (given that someone had just left and we were early). Overall, it's very accessible from public transit, has great local spots for food/drink and gives you a places to crash in Boston at a reasonable price. However, for some creature comforts I would splurge for something a little more plush.","Mission Hill"
"28689","The apartment is wonderful. The location is walking distance to everywhere. The most important thing is that Jazz is the best host I have ever met.

Above all, her hospitality is beyond words. I strongly recommend every traveler in Boston to stay at Jazz's place.","Leather District"
"789.2","I had a long stay there for business (~20 days).  Unfortunately my experience with Sean was not fun.  I will try to review his place in fairness.

Pros:
-The location was perfect. Very close to subway, buses, hubway, stop and shop, walgreens, restaurants and cafe.
-Good price. Based on the location, this low price is very attractive.
-Kitchenette is not gorgeous but has everything you need for simple stuff.  A grill, refrigerator and freezer, microwave (Sean brought it for me), pans, and silver ware.  Espresso machine if you'd like.
-Small but ok room. A Bed, a small sofa, little space to put a suitcase, and kitchenette. That's it.  I put one of my suitcases under the bad.  You have to be creative to find a place to eat and use laptop.

Cons:
-The bath room was nasty. There was no cleaning tools and I wonder when it was cleaned last time.  The bath tub was not draining water very well: it took hours to become empty.  I contacted Sean and asked to fix it.  After 2 weeks or so, Sean came to the room and started a big construction --- breaking the walls and floor around the bath tub and changing the drain pipe.  Not only that I couldn't use the bath tub for several days, this tiny room was cover by dusts, including my foods and bed.  I couldn't accept this conditions, and called Airbnb fro help.  After sending photos, Airbnb understood the situations, refunded for the remaining days, and allowed me to relocate to a nearby hotel by covering some cost for it.  Although Airbnb took care of this incident pretty well, it was a lot of unnecessary hustle during my business trip.
-Wifi was really slow.
-Sean's response to my Emails were slow.  Even after I requested him to change towels and sheets, he didn't respond to most of the time.

Summary:
I had a big trouble with Sean, but now he has fixed the problem with the bath tub.  Is it worth staying now? Maybe.
Airbnb customer service was nice.  It was hard to find contact number (phone number hidden)), but after I explained my troubles their response was generous.

"15564.1","I don't recommend this place. The studio is tiny, hardly any floor space once you have the two beds folded out. It wasn´t very clean and the shower is old and moldy. it's OK if you just want to sleep though and the area and public communications into Boston are OK. 
What really upset me and my friend however was that it was so difficult to get in touch with Sean on arrival. As we entered the US, we had to wait 1,5h (!) at border control (we are European citizens) and we immediately texted Sean that we would be late. We sent several texts, informing him. He never replied. We were really worried as it was nearing midnight and we hadn´t heard from him. We decided to find the studio, praying that he'd be there waiting for us. 

When we arrived he simply said, """"ah, I saw your text, but I didn't reply since it would cost me"""". This made both me and my friend furious, it was just so extremely arrogant to have us worrying like that, tired, late in a foreign city. I understand that he has lots of guests and that it's costly to text people, but hey, ONE SINGLE text, how expensive can it be? it left a very bad impression on me and I'd never recommend this place to anyone.

"15738.1","This room was perfect for me.  I came to Boston to visit my daughter and this place is only a few blocks from her apartment.  
It is exactly as billed.  It's an inexpensive alternative to very expensive hotels in Boston and conveniently located near the T.  An earlier reviewer described it best, it's like staying on the couch of a college student. I'd like to add it's better than that because you're sleeping on a comfy bed and you have your own bathroom! I could have stayed on my daughter's couch but didn't really want to share a bathroom with 4 girls or have to keep their hours.   
This is a student neighborhood so there's a bit more street noise on Friday and Saturday nights.  But the building is very quiet.
Sean was very attentive responding quickly every time I contacted him.

"1580","Christina was a great host. I felt very safe and comfortable at her place. She offered towels and anything else I needed. There is a whole foods nearby that was about a 5 minute walk. It is also a quiet and cozy place that was nice to come home to!  The only thing worth mentioning is there was no microwave for warming food up, but wasn't that big of a deal afterall! I would recommend this place for those who want a quiet, cozy place just outside of the main parts of Boston. ","Mission Hill"

"15798.2","Sean was prompt in answering phone calls, though he seemed not to be reading SMS and emails. So contact him by phone calls. 

Pros: The place was overall clean. The location is very convenient and close to the Green Line and many shops. The fridge and the microwave oven worked properly. 

Cons: The studio is small and the facilities inside seemed quite old. The faucet in the bathroom could not be closed tightly. The sound of dribbling of water was annoying and it was quite a waste of water. (I have known this from the host manual beforehand but could not understand why Sean did not fix it.) The location is too close to Huntington Ave and the noise at night was horrible. The air conditioner did not seem to work properly and was quite noisy. Interestingly we managed to use the noise of the air conditioner as """"white noise"""" to cover the noise from outside so that we had a better sleep at night...

"15631","The apartment is small, old, and not very clean, but it is also really cheap. If you plan to stay just a few days and have a limited budget I would recommend this place, but if you are willing to spend a little bit more for a better apartment maybe you should look for something different.
I stayed here with my girlfriend for four days and overall it was not a bad experience. The neighborhood is really nice and the subway station is really close to the apartment.","Mission Hill"

En general muy practico para un viajero o pareja de viajeros jóvenes que quieran conocer Boston/Cambridge y sus alrededores.","Mission Hill"

"27473.1","We stayed for three nights in the double bedroom and frankly found this a mixed experience.

Firstly, the place is good value for money based on other properties on Airbnb and elsewhere. It might be best suited the budget traveller.

Here were our issues:
1) Our room was smelly and stuffy. Especially the subway food smells from the store downstairs. We hate the smell of subway.
2) There are rules around cleaning dishes and pans etc after use, but they were not observed by the host when we stayed. Every time we went into the kitchen there were dirty dishes etc filling the sink and used kitchen stuff on the benches. We didn't feel comfortable using the kitchen facilities.
3) There were filled garbage bins in the living rooms for the first two days we were there. The living room was not really accessible for use by guests as the host was watching TV most of the time we were there and it is kind of set up as her office.
4) No space in the bathroom for guest items. The bathroom is small and has a fair amount of clutter in it meaning there is no room for guests to store items in the bathroom. On the last day we stay in the apartment there were a total of 6 people staying in the property therefore things can get a little congested and noisy.
5) The room is noisy from people upstairs and the host watching TV at night in the living room, albeit earplugs were provided by the host.
6) The double bed (fold out sofa) was a little small for us and could be more comfortable.  

We looked into alternative accommodation on the first night but were not able to find any, which gives you an indication of the expense and availability of accommodation in the area.  If we had found it we would have asked to move.

Understanding that there have been some great reviews of this place, we just wanted to provide the most balanced view on our experience.

The host was helpful letting us store our bags at the apartment on our final day and the communication was good.","Mission Hill"
"28630","All good. Responsive host, clear instructions, immaculate space, convenient location.","Leather District"
"25400","Only spent one night here, but would have loved to stay longer! The apartment was beautiful with a very sweet cat, a very comfortable bed, and in a very nice building. And there's free parking on a side street nearby, which was a treat. I didn't get to meet Alisa, but her fiance, Casey, was a gracious host-- he stuck around to let us into the building, offered us beer, and helped us guide our confused cab driver when we got lost on our way back to the apartment! All around great stay!","Mission Hill"
"13220","Really great place in a very convenient location - looks just like the pictures.  Matt was very responsive and willing to accommodate any reasonable request we had.","Leather District"
"28530","By far one of the best Airbnb experiences I've had.  Joe and Colleen were amazing hosts, we got in late - she was there to greet us and give a full tour.  Both were super responsive, helpful request, flexible about leaving our bags the last day (had  a late flight home and didn't want to drag our bags all over town from meeting to meeting).  The place itself was perfect, good feel/esthetic, clean, inviting - just wanted to hang there all day :) and the pool table (that should be a new filter when searching a place, does it have a pool table!  Great neighborhood, nice french place across the street, close to public transportation and walking distance to the North End.  Joe/Colleen - thank you again, if back in Boston, will definitely look to stay again if available!","Leather District"

"15612","We had a good short stay in Sean's apartment. It's very well located & great area. I think the apartment is as described, clean & had plenty of room for the two of us (but we are pretty low maintenance). . .Sean was helpful with letting us leave our bags at his place after a horrible overnight bus. However, was a bit slow giving us a specific time early on for check in after I asked if it would be possible to go earlier in the morning - he just kinda put of answering - woulda been nice to just get a specific time & arrangement earlier to arrange our short stay around that. Also, I hate to say it but there is still a few bed bugs. Nothing too serious - i was fine (& we kept our stuff well away in case) but my boyfriend got attacked all over the top of one of his legs :( & completely understand they are tres difficult to get rid of & Sean seems on top of the problem. But overall well priced, comfortable & well located apartment.","Mission Hill"
"28696","Jazz is a generous and charming host. I enjoyed our conversations, her tips for an Oyster bar before dashing off to the airport, and her modern loft.

"16177","After booking I found out that Kara is a representative of a company, not a host per se. This was only my second experience with airbnb so I was surprised.   The apartment is large, clean, but impersonal.  Great airconditioning, a priority for a hot boston week.  Helpful doormen. Great location near hospitals and museem of fine arts. 

.The staff leave starter bags of dishtowels, dish soap, toiletries. Nice.  But Took 5 calls to 3 different numbers to check out...the 2 numbers on  the check out sheet were """"unavailable"""" so had to go back to one on Kara's email. Frustrating.

"15600","I'm hesitant to give this 2 stars -- I'd like to give it one or none -- because I got BED BUGS from this place!  But I have to be fair and say that the location and convenience are great; it's super close to the T, great point from which to explore Boston and restaurants and shops close by. Also, Sean was accommodating and helpful; he brought us more bedding when we needed it and also let us keep our bags in the studio for a few hours past check out time on the day we left so that we wouldn't have to traipse through Boston with them.  BUT, and it's a big BUT, this place feels like it hasn't had a good cleaning in years.  There is dust everywhere and worst of all, the mold was THICK in the bathroom.  So bad and so nasty that I went out and bought tile cleaner and cleaned the thing myself!  When Sean came by (to drop the bedding) he noticed I had cleaned and said something about oh, it'll just be back because there isn't ventilation.  Um, no, it won't come back if you clean regularly.  He also said something along the lines of, well, that's why it's not $200 a night.  Again, no.  I don't care how much I'm paying, I expect a clean and healthy place -- and mold in every crevice of the bathroom is just plain disgusting and unhealthy.  There are also missing tiles in the bathroom floor and some are coming up.  I took pictures of all this by the way, because I couldn't believe it. I wouldn't care so much about that if -- again -- I felt that the bathroom floor had been properly scrubbed in the last year or so.  But whatever, I could get over all that -- it's the BED BUGS I'm mad about.  Lo and behold I come home and to dozens -- maybe hundreds? -- of bites all over my body.  I'd post pictures but they are rather gross. It takes a few days for them to appear so I didn't realize it till after I left, because believe me, otherwise I would have called Sean and AirBnB and demanded a new place to stay.  So yeah, here I am at home, now frantically washing all my clothes and linens.  So if the place were cleaned and exterminated, I'd give it a 3 or 4 (it is very small) but as is, I'd say go somewhere else!","Mission Hill"

During our stay the lock on the front door never seemed to work.. We were forced to pack up all our belongings and hide them in our car! On the second day (after the host told us he had fixed the door) we came home and were faced with a broken lock once again!
And to top it all off,my girlfriend woke up every morning covered with insect bites!
I would not recommend this apartment to anyone, unless you are extremely broke and do not mind spending an hour per day trying to enter and lock your apartment and waking up with itchy insect bites...","Mission Hill"

"15764","This listing was not accurate, except the location; I do not recommend this place. The place has not been cleaned in a really long time, everything is dusty and rusty. The faucet in the bathroom is leaking continuosly (for at least the last 9 months according to other reviews), and one of the elements on the stove is not functioning. Yes, the place has a great location right next to public transportation. As expected, the place was small, which didn't bother us, but the cleanliness did. Check in says 1 pm, with most of the time during school sheets being changed by 3 pm, I check in at 4 pm and place still had trash from the previous person and sheets were not changed. When I texted Sean to confirm that check in was 1 pm and I wanted to nap, since I was on the road since 4 am, I was told that using the word """"disgusting"""" to lay on other people's sheets was an exagerration and he proceeded to ask me """"How many times I change my sheets per week at home"""". I thought that was a very rude comment. Also, I was told that there are specifically rules about napping; I think he is confusing his listings (he has 6 listing), there is nothing about napping rules on this property. If I pay for a place, I should nap whenever I please. When he stopped by at 6 pm, he seemed like a nice person, but that still doesn't change my opinion of the place. I did appreciate that he took the window unit out of the window once I pointed that it was very drafty around it and it was a cold February week end in Boston. His listing also mentions that shoes should not be worn inside, fine by me, as long as you respect your own rules. When he came in he didn't take off his shoes and he left the floor wet and dirty. The little area rug was dirty and the floor was dirty as well. If you want me to take off my shoes, please provide me with a clean floor. Due to the schedule we had for Saturday, we were not able to secure  other sleeping accomodations so we spent 2 nights there. If I would have known the disrepair of this place, I would have definitely skipped it. We didn't expect a 5 star hotel for the price, but definitely not the dirty place we found. ","Mission Hill"
"15637","We spent a night in this room on 25 Aug 2013 (sorry we could not report earlier), and we were bitten by BED BUGS (more than 30 bites in total on various body parts), so they are NOT gone. 

Unless the owner can guarantee that the flat has been professionally sanitized (replacing the mattress is not sufficient), I would absolutely AVOID this place for the moment. We had to wash/dry/isolate all clothes and deal with ugly bites on a holiday trip... not funny. 

Apart from that the room is small (as expected) and rather dirty (not acceptable). The location is good, very close to public transport.","Mission Hill"
"28691","I had a lovely stay at Jazz's place. It was immaculate. Spare, clean, well-decorated. 
Jazz met me at the front and gave me a lay of the land. She hung around for a bit and departed. She is friendly, chatty, and helpful. 
I had a conference in Boston. When I returned in the evening, she was there to check on things. As I got into calls I had to make, she took her leave. 
I wanted a place close to South Station since I had to travel to the conference on the commuter train. It was incredibly convenient. 
Except for the garbage trucks coming into the alley at night, the place was truly quiet and relaxing. The bed was soft but firm. Best night of sleep is had in months. 
Jazz set up the coffee to go on in the morning and had English muffins out (even though there is an awesome diner just around the corner).

It was about a 10 to 15 minute walk to the T station.  Brookline is a great community and there are a couple of good places just around the corner from Amy's.  My only caution would be that if you have mobility issues, you may have difficulty with the steep stairs.  ","Mission Hill"
"34054","The apartment is fine, and the location is great for walking, but the T (trolley) stop is directly across the street, so the bedrooms do get noisy.  The apartment is a 4th floor walk-up (with dirty carpeting), which makes it a bit challenging.  The kitchen is lovely; the bedrooms and the bathroom could use better linens and mattresses and towels in order to be 'upscale', as advertised.  Half-used toiletries were left in the bathroom, which I think is inappropriate.  Kama was kind and helpful and was available by text thruout the weekend, and I appreciated her guidance.  The information booklet with vital information about parking, etc. left in the apartment was incomplete (pages missing).  This apartment just needs a bit of attention, I think. ","Mission Hill"
"15649","Sean's place was a kind of a disappointment for us. The place is small as described, but that's not the problem. The real issue is the big amount of dirt we found all over the place. The freezer reeks and is so dirty that we found it impossible to use. The location though is awesome. There are plenty of good places to eat around, not to mention there is a train station nearby. The thing is if you're looking for cleaness and a big room thats definetly not the place, but if your budged is low and you're trying to be well located, go for it.

"10129.3","THIS place was TERRIBLE and DOES not meet minimum cleanliness standards.

Joshua was not upfront that there are 5 other people leaving in that APT. Also he did not tell me that he does not live there any more. Basically he was subletting the place and I was not informed of this. 

The place is really Dark and very badly maintained by these 2o year old college kids. There was one bathroom used by all the five 5 roommates and it was nasty as hell. The other bathroom was on a different floor and the plumbing was broken. The bathrooms were not cleaned for months, as I could see rolls or used toilet paper and empty shampoo bottles with sticky floor. 

Since Joshua doe not live there and was a surprise for me, I was not comfortable staying with these people, and compete for the nastiest bathroom. I tried tried taking the shower and the water would not drain and my whole body started itching for the whole day with red rashes. 

I basically vacated the place without staying for a night, even though I reserved for 2 weeks.

I do not recommend this place for any one as this does not meet the cleanness standards or a place you would have to pay so much. Description does not meet what I say there.

Worst part the kitchen and the washing room were so dark and nasty with lots of Trash from almost 3 months lying all over the APT. I could even smell POT all over the place. There were cigarette buds 100's of them all over the APT, bathroom, kitchen etc.

"39612","The house is located in a nice neighborhood close to numerous bars and restaurants. The place is seperated from the rest of the house and has a private entrance. Everything was clean and tidy up. Ceilings are low and most of the space is taken up by furniture. For us it was perfectly fine but I can imagine that people with claustrophobic tendencies might not feel at ease. The hosts are very helpful and friendly.","Mission Hill"
"15727.1","We stayed 3 nights at the studio and there are so many things to say..
this studio does not meet basic standards of cleanliness and safety, Airbnb should not allow to rent such a place. The low price can not justify it! That was easy to get the keys, probably the only good point of this Airbnb (with the location, close to subway station). The rest was UNACCEPTABLE, and we contacted Airbnb to let them know, the pictures were taken probably many years ago, and the flat is not like in the pics. It was dirty, and mostly NOT safe. Even for the """"price"""" that is ok, this is not possible to rent a flat like that !!!  I took a lot of pictures that I am going to send to Airbnb to prevent this flat. 

MAIN ROOM: 
- 1st day, we saw a cockroach on the floor (even if the building is old), that is not possible !!
- wall lamp in the room is broken (not like in the picture). 
- the studio is old but the main problem is the level of disrepair, dirtiness (water splash on the door of the bathroom), and safety (electrical outlet where it's written """"do not unplug"""" , why ??) 
- I m not going to detail everything (old computer on the floor that takes place for nothing, foam insulation on the wall, etc)
- kitchen and bath are dirty and outdated 
- ceiling lamp with visible wires (very dangerous!) 
- the fridge was not emptied by previous renters 

Bathroom:
- broken ventilation in the bathroom is very dusty but still works (really unsafe)
- there is some mold on the bathroom's ceinling and some sanitary napkins to contain it !!! (this is more than dirty !!!)

For sure we were expecting a small and basic studio (as the pictures are showing) but not such an unhealthy place. This is unacceptable

"16512","Nicolas was incredibly responsive which at a time when the entire city seemed to be booked for the night provided a huge amount of comfort. I generally waited less than 3 minutes to receive an answer to any inquiry. The condo was exactly as pictured, perfectly located for my trip, and very easy to check-in and out of. Three of us stayed there and while I did not personally sleep on the sleeper sofa the report I got in the morning was that the quality of the bed's comfort was exceptional. This is a high end property with a fantastic host. As a first time Airbnb user I happily left Boston as new customer.  Nicolas' condo is great for an overnight business trip and imagine it would provide a special home-away-from-home for any extended stay. ","Leather District"
"15602","Sean was a very accommodating host. He worked very hard to make my stay enjoyable. As you might have read in other reviews, the apartment had a case of the bed bugs, which are VERY difficult to get rid of. I arrived early and Sean was in the apartment with the bed apart and steaming everything (the best way to get rid of them). I'm happy to say that in my 4-night stay, I saw no bed bugs anywhere. Yes, the apartment is small. But as others noted, you are probably going to be out all day and just need a place to sleep. Therefore, it didn't bother me. The room wasn't spotless, but it was as clean enough. It's kind of like what you'd expect if you crashed at a friend's dorm room. The location is nice: you are about 30 seconds from the Fenwood Rd Green Line stop. My only real gripes were that the wireless connection was slow and the bathroom faucet leaked. Otherwise, I enjoyed my stay considering the price.","Mission Hill"
"15581","Please read this review before you consider booking this place! Also please note that I am yet to leave a bad review on yelp. My partner and I have been travelling with airbnb stops for about the last 4 months and are not at all fussy travellers. 
The apartment is not what it seems when you book it.
Pictures-
The pictures on the site do not clearly represent the apartment. The photos are spaciously deceptive and do not  give a true representation of what we found when we arrived. There is not room for one person to be comfortable here let alone two travellers with suitcases. The pictures did not show how two people would have to sleep - with one on a mattress on the floor. The pictures also do not portray the state of the apartment - the kitchen and bathroom were both not in the condition in which we found the place.


Cleanliness-
The place was not acceptable to live in. It was disgusting. The bathroom tiles are filed with mould and rust and dust. The floors are all covered with dust and look like the place has never seen a broom before. I could never allow for a places would stay in to get like that let alone to leave it in such a state and have the nerve to let someone else stay there. It is an embarrassment to do such a thing. The kitchen was also disgusting and left uncleaned from when it was last used. It was in such a state that we did not feel comfortable to use the facilities. 

Overall it was a disgusting place to stay in where we can barely fit ourselves in let alone all of our luggage. I definitely do NOT recommend for anyone to stay here. We payed an outrageous price to stay in such a place - one of our most expensive stops on our trip and with out a doubt the worst. ","Mission Hill"

"28667","Jazz made my experience of Boston even better. She is very knowledgeable of the city and immensely accommodating. She has a ton of great recommendations for dining, night life, etc. The loft itself is kept very clean; it feels like a hotel. If you're traveling to Boston, I would recommend staying here.","Leather District"
"28679","From beginning to the end Jazz made us feel very much at home. The apartment is located in a highly accessible part of the city with easy access to many landmarks and mass transit stations. As described, the room is well maintained, the apartment is contemporary and clean and the host did an amazing job making us feel welcomed. ","Leather District"
"28622","Jazz is a phenomenal host: ultra responsive, flexible & generous.  From water at bedside to coffee, her loft offered a hotel-like experience at proximity to the waterfront / financial district.  

I wish all hosts could learn from Jazz and her responsiveness via Airbnb messaging and text.  She's an accomplished person I look forward to someday reunioning with in SF.","Leather District"
"28532","This is a beautiful apartment. My boyfriend, Eric, his dad and I stayed at the apartment for the weekend of Father's Day. We went to a Redsox game. The apartment is very spacious and interesting.  It gets lots of sunlight and was a lovely spot to hang out in.  Eric's dad is older and it was wonderful to have the apartment to rest in between outings and still be social.  The apartment added a great deal to our experience and was a comfortable space for Eric's dad. The location is terrific with some nice restaurants around. It is right next to South Station which makes it very easy to get anywhere in Boston.

Joe and Colleen were excellent hosts. Joe met us and showed us around the apartment and took us to a great neighborhood diner right down the block. He was very generous with his time. Colleen checked in with us several times during our stay to make sure we had everything we needed. 
I think the price is spot on - if we had stayed at a hotel and rented 2 rooms for 2 nights at a hotel it would have cost a lot more .
Guest's should be aware that the apartment is a 3rd floor walk up.

"15557","The suite is conveniently located for visits in Boston. There is quite a bit of noise from the nearby major street with street cars, busses and traffic. I wouldn't recommend it to light sleepers like myself. Even with earplugs, I woke up several times during the nights. It is a really small space, good enough to sleep in, but not great to spend any extra time.","Mission Hill"
"15733","I had a very poor experience with the apartment and the host. This listing has great reviews, so perhaps the host was a bit off of his game. Whatever the case, here's my experience: 

The apartment: The photos on airbnb show an inviting and clean if not small studio. In person, I found a cluttered room that had clearly not been cleaned in some time. There were food crumbs on the floor, and the bed unmade with apparently dirty sheets. 

The host: Sean initially confirmed the reservation very quickly, but when I needed information about getting the key and checking in, I couldn't get a response. I finally made contact mid afternoon of the day of my reservation. When I was finally able to drop off my luggage, I had no time to track down Sean to find out why the apartment was in poor condition. I didn't stay the night and had to find other accommodation. 

Sean was defensive and unprofessional when I confronted him via email. He refused to offer a refund. Luckily a Airbnb representative was able to intervene. Ironically, Sean was very quick to write up my review, even before I had a chance to formally ask for a refund.  So, at least you can be assured Sean can be responsive when he feels motivated.","Mission Hill"
"28710","What a great stay! Jazz was such a warm and welcoming host. The apartment is incredible and immaculately clean. Jazz made sure I was comfortable within her home and provided me with clean towels, toiletries, and water for my stay. She also had coffee/tea and English 
Muffins on hand for me in the morning. Her apartment is conveniently located just a few blocks from South Station. I will be staying here again!","Leather District"
"882","I never met Sean. I was only in touch with him through Phone and text messaging.  The place is a good location, a bed, and a tiny tiny bathroom and shower.  Everything about this listing is cheap cheap cheap.  The blinds on the windows fall as soon as you touch them, the bed was assembled with plywood, and the mattress has very little spring in it.  The cups and dishes were covered in dust and there was no obvious sponge to clean them, so I just ate out or bought prepared food.  He did leave me linens and towels.  Also, the window doesn't close well so it can get quite cold in the winter when I visited.  Nothing unsafe or dishonest about this apartment just definitely not luxury.","Mission Hill"
"15729","Communication with Sean was very good and helpful, we did not have any problems to find the apartment and get into it. The Apartment itself was disappointing: extremely small and run down and somewhat shabby, especially the bathroom. Bed is very uncomfortable and too small for two. The photos are very well made... And one needs earplugs as the busy street is very close and the neighbourhood is loud.
Good: Towels, conveniently located and the breakfast place around the corner.","Mission Hill"
"15594","Sean's apartment was lovely and quaint. 
It's a but rough around the edges but its got style and, most importantly, amenity on its side. 

It's right near the T that goes right into town and right past Symphony Hall (which was a big plus for me).

I enjoyed having my own space for a reasonable price. Sean was most helpful and accommodating. 

There was quite a bit of noise from the trams in the morning and the general building its self. But I recall being warned about that. 

Overall it's a good place to stay. I'd do it again. ","Mission Hill"
"15637.1","We spent a night in this room on 25 Aug 2013 (sorry we could not report earlier), and we were bitten by BED BUGS (more than 30 bites in total on various body parts), so they are NOT gone. 

Unless the owner can guarantee that the flat has been professionally sanitized (replacing the mattress is not sufficient), I would absolutely AVOID this place for the moment. We had to wash/dry/isolate all clothes and deal with ugly bites on a holiday trip... not funny. 

Apart from that the room is small (as expected) and rather dirty (not acceptable). The location is good, very close to public transport.","Mission Hill"
"28606","Great place to stay and Jazz was really flexible with arrival time and when I came and went.  She even saved me since it was raining like crazy when I arrived and she hooked me up with a jacket and umbrella.  She definitely bent over backwards to try and make sure I had a nice stay.","Leather District"
"27473","We stayed for three nights in the double bedroom and frankly found this a mixed experience.

Firstly, the place is good value for money based on other properties on Airbnb and elsewhere. It might be best suited the budget traveller.

Here were our issues:
1) Our room was smelly and stuffy. Especially the subway food smells from the store downstairs. We hate the smell of subway.
2) There are rules around cleaning dishes and pans etc after use, but they were not observed by the host when we stayed. Every time we went into the kitchen there were dirty dishes etc filling the sink and used kitchen stuff on the benches. We didn't feel comfortable using the kitchen facilities.
3) There were filled garbage bins in the living rooms for the first two days we were there. The living room was not really accessible for use by guests as the host was watching TV most of the time we were there and it is kind of set up as her office.
4) No space in the bathroom for guest items. The bathroom is small and has a fair amount of clutter in it meaning there is no room for guests to store items in the bathroom. On the last day we stay in the apartment there were a total of 6 people staying in the property therefore things can get a little congested and noisy.
5) The room is noisy from people upstairs and the host watching TV at night in the living room, albeit earplugs were provided by the host.
6) The double bed (fold out sofa) was a little small for us and could be more comfortable.  

We looked into alternative accommodation on the first night but were not able to find any, which gives you an indication of the expense and availability of accommodation in the area.  If we had found it we would have asked to move.

Understanding that there have been some great reviews of this place, we just wanted to provide the most balanced view on our experience.

The host was helpful letting us store our bags at the apartment on our final day and the communication was good.","Mission Hill"
"885","The apartment was exactly as described, and Sean was super easy to deal with. We didn't meet, but he sent over the information on how to pickup the key right away. It was super easy to find the apartment and the lockbox, and the neighborhood was super cute! Internet worked without issue. This is a really affordable option for staying in Boston if all you need is a place to crash comfortably. ","Mission Hill"
"28634","Jazz was very accommodating and my stay was fantastic. The apartment was clean and beautiful. This was my first foray with AirBnB but will definitely not be my last!","Leather District"
"15770","Sean was not at the location when I arrived despite having been called three times to alert him to the time of my arrival.  The key was not in the lockbox.  I waited in the cold rain for him to come with the key to let me in.  Upon entering the studio the previous tenant's used sheets and towels were in a pile on the bed.  Sean left me in the apartment while he went to the laundry in the basement to wash everything.  It was a good hour from the time I initially arrived outside until I was able to occupy the space.  It is, as I expected for the price, a spartan space, but it needs a thorough cleaning.  Sticky table, dusty lamp, dirty soap dish.  Sean warns of a leaky faucet in the bathroom, but it is more like a cascade of hot water pouring from the faucet.  Sean is a very nice man, however, and will rectify these problems for the next occupants, I hope.","Mission Hill"
"27726","Steven was a great host; he made it super simple to get to the apartment, was in constant contact via text message if I needed anything, and the apartment was accurately described. The apartment is situated in between the Orange and Green T Lines, which made getting into the city a snap. There are a few small grocery stores located nearby, as well as a larger grocery store 8 minutes away by foot. I didn't spend much time in the neighborhood, but it seemed like there were a lot of cool new restaurants and bars to check out. 

Some things about the apartment: it is small, but very usable. There is no washer and dryer, which is typical for Boston, so don't plan on being able to do laundry. Everything was very clean, but this is an old building, so it's not much to look at from the outside. The neighbors upstairs were often loud and there were a lot of people in and out of the building up until about 2 - 3am. If noise bothers you, I would not recommend staying here. I have lived in NYC, so this was not an issue to me. 

All-in-all, I highly recommend Steven's apartment!","Mission Hill"
"28676","We loved staying with Jazz. She was an amazing host. She gave us great tips of where to eat, visit, buy and everything, she was very helpfull for our trip. We were so confortable in her place, the apartament was so pretty and Jazz had a great attitude. Our room was very nice and we had a lot of place for our lugage and stuff. We even had our own TV. Her apartment is in a excellent location, it's so close to a lot of good places like Boston Common, Newburry and other places you will like to visit. 

She really maked us feel like we were at home :)","Leather District"
"15767","I hate to leave a negative review, but after many Airbnb experiences, this one left a bit to be desired. The entrance key was not left behind for me; the previous guests hadn’t left it as they should have, but the host hadn’t ensured it was there, which wasn't the best way to welcome a guest if anything goes wrong. In the end, I waited an hour and a half outside the building, to the point that neighbors offered to let me in and asked if I was ok. I would have gone for a coffee or lunch to avoid loitering, but Sean told me he was coming shortly.  I had very little time to spend in Boston, and though Sean responded fairly quickly, he didn’t come for an hour. While Sean seemed like a nice, laid-back guy who tried to accommodate me and did apologize (a little), he seemed somewhat oblivious to the fact that this was kind of a big bummer and really threw my plans off.  When I realized there was no key, I asked Sean to call me so we could sort it all that way quickly, but he only texted and sent Airbnb messages, which wasn’t easy to handle in the cold on my phone , and I guess that made me feel like he was avoiding a conversation, which would have been reassuring. Upon entering the apartment late in the afternoon with him once he arrived (3pm, check in was about 1pm), I can’t lie; the place was pretty dirty, had an odor, and at that point I was a bit exasperated. To Sean’s credit, after I returned in the evening and he had changed the sheets and cleaned, it was better. (Sorry! As someone else mentioned, I think the place needs a deep clean and a bit of maintenance to be truly ready for guests--I understand the apartment is old and I don't care about that a bit, but that doesn't mean it can't be cleaned and maintained in a caring way, and I would feel a bit bad renting a place in this shape. It looks rougher than the pictures.) On the plus side: the apartment was the perfect temperature, it's conveniently located by the green line, the kitchenette is useful, wifi was fine, and Sean was really nice to bring a bike over for me that I felt badly I couldn't use in the end due to limited time and more snow. I get that things happen, and this is one way to do an Airbnb rental (minimal maintenance and a full guest list based on a good city location), but I would have appreciated a little more, “Sorry once again about the big hiccup getting in, I really apologize for that and will look into a better system so it doesn’t happen again!,” instead of him inquiring whether I’d returned the key (of course I did after my experience! :) )-- that would have gone a long way. ","Mission Hill"
"15727","We stayed 3 nights at the studio and there are so many things to say..
this studio does not meet basic standards of cleanliness and safety, Airbnb should not allow to rent such a place. The low price can not justify it! That was easy to get the keys, probably the only good point of this Airbnb (with the location, close to subway station). The rest was UNACCEPTABLE, and we contacted Airbnb to let them know, the pictures were taken probably many years ago, and the flat is not like in the pics. It was dirty, and mostly NOT safe. Even for the """"price"""" that is ok, this is not possible to rent a flat like that !!!  I took a lot of pictures that I am going to send to Airbnb to prevent this flat. 

MAIN ROOM: 
- 1st day, we saw a cockroach on the floor (even if the building is old), that is not possible !!
- wall lamp in the room is broken (not like in the picture). 
- the studio is old but the main problem is the level of disrepair, dirtiness (water splash on the door of the bathroom), and safety (electrical outlet where it's written """"do not unplug"""" , why ??) 
- I m not going to detail everything (old computer on the floor that takes place for nothing, foam insulation on the wall, etc)
- kitchen and bath are dirty and outdated 
- ceiling lamp with visible wires (very dangerous!) 
- the fridge was not emptied by previous renters 

Bathroom:
- broken ventilation in the bathroom is very dusty but still works (really unsafe)
- there is some mold on the bathroom's ceinling and some sanitary napkins to contain it !!! (this is more than dirty !!!)

For sure we were expecting a small and basic studio (as the pictures are showing) but not such an unhealthy place. This is unacceptable 
Pierre","Mission Hill"
"27480.1","I would not recommend staying here.

Location - The apartment was in a good area as far as transit and walking goes.  I didn't have any trouble finding parking on the street and left my car for 2 nights without issue.

Bedroom - The bedroom was tiny.  The picture is just about the entire room.  The apartment is just above a Subway and the smell of bread was extremely strong.  The Subway also plays music starting sometime around 6:00 - 6:30 AM and it woke me up each morning.

Bathroom - The bathroom was shared, which is awkward in some instances but overall not terrible.  Problem is the bathroom was gross.  There was hair everything and a huge clump in the drain that swirled around when I turned the shower on.  I was so grossed out from the shower that I did not even shower the last morning.

Cleanliness - The bedroom was clean but that is it.  I already mentioned the bathroom but the apartment itself wasn't overly clean either.  In the middle of the living room there was a huge rack where the host was drying her pants.  I wouldn't care too much that the place was a bit messy but the host had a rule about no shoes and asked us to wear these ridiculous """"sandals"""" around the place.  

Friendliness - I would not classify the host as friendly.  She wasn't rude but definitely wasn't nice.  Every encounter was awkward.  I asked if I could store my bike on her patio and she just flat refused.  Her patio is quite large and empty.  She just wasn't very accommodating. 

Sleeping - The room was listed as sleeping three but what we found was one """"bed"""" and one air mattress.  The bed was not comfortable and the air mattress is an air mattress.  I would not recommend staying here with more than two guests.

Overall - I would not recommend that you stay here.  I was looking for alternative places to stay as soon as we """"checked in"""" but on such short notice I wasn't able to find anything.  Next time I travel to Boston I will absolutely not considering staying here again no matter the price.  

Final Note - I honestly felt that the profile for this place is borderline false advertising.  The room doesn't really sleep three, it's not cozy at all (it's tiny), it smells of Subway (not in a good way), the host isn't friendly, and the host isn't very accommodating.  If you have a choice, choose to stay elsewhere.","Mission Hill"
"15742","Sean seems  to have a lot of places to rent out in Boston, but he is relatively responsive and was very patient when I had a hard time to try to open the key locker. 

The location is good. But since it is pretty cheap to stay, you get what you pay for. The light is blinking so I had to go buy a new light bulb. The restroom is the part which I do not particularly like. There were no shampoo, body soap prepared. I have to admit I wasn't feeling comfortable to take shower there. But to be honest, if you pay less, don't expect more right?  I am not sure if I am the one who is picky or not. 

The internet is ok if you don't need watch videos on line. I was in Boston for Career Forum and it took me 2 hours to watch a 40 min company introduction video because of the slow connection. I was very frustrated but again whom I can blame?

The room is not really clean but I had clean sheet, clean towels. I could not find the heater? so it was a little bit chilly during the night. 
I think there is a lot of improvements can be done in that room but again I only paid that little money to stay. I didn't expect much but if you care about cleanliness and comfort, I recommend you to pay more for a better place.  

But I have to say Sean is a good guy. Since I forgot my charger in his house, he shipped it to me with express shipping. I really appreciate him doing that for me. 

I think for me, he just really needs to hire one guy to clean the whole place once thoroughly. ","Mission Hill"

My wife and I are 68 and fortunately we are both fit but the mattress would have been a problem for a less able couple.The smoke detector in the bedroom was hanging from the ceiling  secured by the electrical wiring. Both blinds in the bedroom were broken and did not operate. There was mold on the bathroom tiles.Only one element on the cooker worked. The whole apartment would have been vastly improved with a decoration and attention given to the above points none of which would have involved large financial expense.
I would not recommend this apartment to anyone.","Mission Hill"

We were extremely disappointed by Sean's careless attitude after a long journey to get to Boston. ","Mission Hill"

"789.1","I had a long stay there for business (~20 days).  Unfortunately my experience with Sean was not fun.  I will try to review his place in fairness.

Pros:
-The location was perfect. Very close to subway, buses, hubway, stop and shop, walgreens, restaurants and cafe.
-Good price. Based on the location, this low price is very attractive.
-Kitchenette is not gorgeous but has everything you need for simple stuff.  A grill, refrigerator and freezer, microwave (Sean brought it for me), pans, and silver ware.  Espresso machine if you'd like.
-Small but ok room. A Bed, a small sofa, little space to put a suitcase, and kitchenette. That's it.  I put one of my suitcases under the bad.  You have to be creative to find a place to eat and use laptop.

Cons:
-The bath room was nasty. There was no cleaning tools and I wonder when it was cleaned last time.  The bath tub was not draining water very well: it took hours to become empty.  I contacted Sean and asked to fix it.  After 2 weeks or so, Sean came to the room and started a big construction --- breaking the walls and floor around the bath tub and changing the drain pipe.  Not only that I couldn't use the bath tub for several days, this tiny room was cover by dusts, including my foods and bed.  I couldn't accept this conditions, and called Airbnb fro help.  After sending photos, Airbnb understood the situations, refunded for the remaining days, and allowed me to relocate to a nearby hotel by covering some cost for it.  Although Airbnb took care of this incident pretty well, it was a lot of unnecessary hustle during my business trip.
-Wifi was really slow.
-Sean's response to my Emails were slow.  Even after I requested him to change towels and sheets, he didn't respond to most of the time.

Summary:
I had a big trouble with Sean, but now he has fixed the problem with the bath tub.  Is it worth staying now? Maybe.
Airbnb customer service was nice.  It was hard to find contact number (phone number hidden)), but after I explained my troubles their response was generous.

Plus Joe is a great host, very responsive and very flexible. It was sooo easy that I'll never go back to staying in a hotel again and when i go back to Boston I will DEFINITELY stay at Joe's again. The neighborhood is quiet and within walking distance of basically everything in the city and the South St station always has cabs ready to go. There is an awesome diner on the corner that is open 24/7 and some really classy restaurants and a french wine bar directly across the street. Minutes from the Commons, what else do you need??? If you visit Boston, stay here, you will thank me...and Joe!!!!","Leather District"
"16177.1","After booking I found out that Kara is a representative of a company, not a host per se. This was only my second experience with airbnb so I was surprised.   The apartment is large, clean, but impersonal.  Great airconditioning, a priority for a hot boston week.  Helpful doormen. Great location near hospitals and museem of fine arts. 

.The staff leave starter bags of dishtowels, dish soap, toiletries. Nice.  But Took 5 calls to 3 different numbers to check out...the 2 numbers on  the check out sheet were """"unavailable"""" so had to go back to one on Kara's email. Frustrating.

"921","Sean was good with communication, it was cheap and for one night worked ok. We did have several problems however. Room really is very small. Arm length and a half wide and two lengths long, clean enough but not sparkling which is ok can't expect too much for 80 a night, but I wouldn't stay there again. I've stayed at the Hostel in Chinatown and although you don't get a private room you still have more space than Sean's place and as a single traveler you'll save 20 bucks. Our biggest problem was in the bed. I laid down and there was no way it was holding us for the night. We literally had to sleep with the mattress on the floor because the plywood and 1x planking couldn't hold us. I'm not small but we aren't huge either. Id say if your going to build a bed do it with materials that will hold weight, 2x4's and posts not extra flooring really poorly put together. Sean should spend the money and go to ikea. Our other problem and this one was awkward was a knock on the door around 1030 am wanting to look at the """"apartment"""" I was in my underwear and well 4 people in that tiny room with me in my undies was a bit awkward. One person one night on a budget ok, but I'd still stay at one of the hostels if traveling alone and honestly with two of us even as a couple it was too small.  We really aren't that picky I promise, it just even for the inexpensive price was not worth the value. ","Mission Hill"
"28604","Jazz was a wonderful host - she had everything prepared and ready for me.  She also gave me a whole bunch of pointers for things to see and places to go in Boston.  

The place is spotless and spacious. It's a short walk to Chinatown.  City transport was also very accessible.","Leather District"
"28705","great loft, great location, great host. 
bottom line: wonderful experience!","Leather District"
"824","L'appartement est proche de la ligne E, et tout le nécessaire est présent. Sean répond rapidement aux messages. 
Cependant l'appartement est sale (poubelle non vidée, les toilettes ne sont pas entièrement nettoyé, le dessous du lit n'a pas du voir de ballet depuis 6 mois...) et manque vraiment d'entretien. Il y a un trou dans la fenêtre qui laisse passe l'air et le bruit. Du coup on entend tout dehors... 
Bien pour une ou deux nuits max si vous avez un tout petit budget...","Mission Hill"
"27476","Alexandra was very accommodating. We arrived before the check in time and she invited us to pass by her office (1 minute from the house) to pick up the keys and make ourselves comfortable at home. She also allowed us to leave our luggage at home during the day of departure, although in the end we didn't have to. During our stay, she behaved in a polite and quiet way. 
The """"cozy private room"""" is indeed cozy and the bed is comfortable for two people. There is enough room in the closet to put your belongings. However, the room has no proper ventilation and gets a little stuffy. I found the general hygiene only moderately correct. Linens and towels were freshly washed, but not the cover or the floors. The bathroom and the kitchen were not very clean either: hair in bathtub and sink, dirty dishes, etc. The entrance stairs that lead to the apartment are really smelly and dirty. I don't mean that it was unbearable, but since all reviews claim that the apartment is super clean, I just wanted to emphasize that according to certain standards it was not. 
Internet worked perfectly, and the T and bus connections are just as Alexandra describes, so no surprises to that effect.
I thank Alexandra for welcoming us in her home!","Mission Hill"
"28612","This has been mentioned in other reviews, but I'll say it again: the photos don't do this apartment justice! HUGE space and very very clean. I would rate this above my best hotel visits. Jazz is a great host and very detail-oriented. She was available throughout our stay for questions via text/phone and also left a helpful printout guide for the apartment. She also included (in the guide) some of her favorite places to eat and where to find necessities (toiletries and coffee) in neighborhood.","Leather District"

"28688","Staying at Jazz's place makes you feel at home. The house is well-organized, clean, and comfortable—And yes, the location really is close to everything. 

Jazz is a lovely and helpful host. My girlfriend and I were visiting to survey the area for the possibility of living there in the future, she then spent a significant amount of time answering our questions and helping find apartments.

10/10 would stay again.","Leather District"
"15538","The apartment was exactly as described and pictured. The location was great as it was on one of the main tramlines to downtown. Lots of take-away places nearby and a supermarket round the corner. This place was perfect for me as I just needed somewhere to crash at night but it would be a tight squeeze for 2 people. Sean very kindly waited in for me as I arrived late (3am) so I was very thankful for that. He was very helpful and answered most of the questions I had. A little expensive for what it is (going on what I have had elsewhere) but I guess that's because it is Boston. All in all very pleasant experience.","Mission Hill"
"28684","I had a really great experience with Jazz. Her place is super clean and modern with a comfy bed. Very convenient to great food, entertainment, Boston Common, South Station, etc. She really should charge more for such a nice place! No doubt I'll book with her again.","Leather District"

"28542","Joe's place is great! It is about 5 mins walk from South Station, Chinatown and the Common so a perfect base for exploring the city. 
The flat was really cosy and we felt really at home there. Oh and the beds are so comfortable! We were late getting in from the airport and Joe stayed around until we arrived.  He was on hand to answer any questions we had during our stay. The neighbourhood was quiet and safe, with a great store a few doors up and the famous South Street Diner on the corner. I can't recommend this place highly enough :-)","Leather District"
"28701","This is how you do it! Fast communication pre booking, excellent arrival instructions, fabulous place style wise, comfy bed, air con, great shower. It's under five mins from south station and was pleased I'd picked this location over back bay etc, for ease of walking everywhere. Jazz knows what she's doing . Definitely stay here.","Leather District"

"15627","This apartment is fine if you are only spending a short time there and just need somewhere for a night. I would not recommend it for longer. The location of this flat is excellent, it is right on the green T line and is near to some good places to eat and local shops. The flat itself, however, is rather tired and is in desperate need of decorating and thorough cleaning. The fan is hanging off the bathroom ceiling, a light is missing, walls and sheets are also stained and the room itself needs quite a lot of work. There is a single bed and an air bed so having a double bed is quite tricky especially given the very small dimensions of the room. Sean was helpful and responded to emails quickly so I can only give positive reviews of the host himself. ","Mission Hill"
"15601","Pros: 
- good location
- easy access to public transportation
- wireless internet, running water, lights turn on
- host was prompt with responses via email/text/phone
- reasonable price

Cons:
Despite what the host says, there are STILL bed bugs at this apartment. My friend and I found bugs EVERY, SINGLE night and woke up with bites. I took pictures of the bugs too and would post it up if it were possible. When the problem was addressed to the host  in person at the end of my stay, he came off as defensive and kept repeating the fact that he had hired someone to get rid of the bed bugs already. But at the end of the day, there are still bed bugs so it doesn't matter to me if someone was hired to exterminate the bugs already. I understand that this place was fairly inexpensive to rent, but the apartment was dusty and bug infested. I had to frantically wash all my clothes and sheets when I got home. ","Mission Hill"
"28674","Jazz was a great host.  Great communication, nice room, and great location.  I would definitely stay hear again anytime I visit Boston.","Leather District"
"15693","Communication with the host was satisfactory. The Apartment was very disappointing. There was no stopper for the bath or basin and the basin faucet dripped all the time. The cover was missing from the extract fan which was clogged with dust. The bed was a mattress on the floor. My wife and I are 68 and fortunately we are both fit but the mattress would have been a problem for a less able couple.The smoke detector in the bedroom was hanging from the ceiling  secured by the electrical wiring. Both blinds in the bedroom were broken and did not operate. There was mold on the bathroom tiles.Only one element on the cooker worked. The whole apartment would have been vastly improved with a decoration and attention given to the above points none of which would have involved large financial expense.
I would not recommend this apartment to anyone.","Mission Hill"

"15571.1","Positive points: this very small flat (definitively for a single) is well situated, very close to a T station linked to downtown in 15mn.
Negative: it requires to be refurbished urgently: very old, numerous failures, electric network outdated and dangerous, but it is also dirty (room and washroom). Sean do not do the minimum after each stays. Additionally, you are not allowed to switch off the old PC, so you have the noise made by the CU all along the night (+ the fridge noise, plus the dropping tap + the roar of the avenue...): don't miss your ear plugs.
I met a stressed Sean 15 mn on arrival and bye-bye. No guest book in the room with key informations and advices...
Sean is not fair enough and do not fulfill the Airbnb minimum requirements. 
The price is good... until you discover the reality.","Mission Hill"
"13225","Mat is a good guy. He made both of us feel very welcome and was on hand to answer any questions throughout the 2 weeks we stayed there.  The apartment was perfect as just a few steps from the office.  Brilliant, homely and well equipped with everything we needed.  Beds were comfy and large.  Great location and will def recommend to other  people in the business if they stay in the future.  Thanks for being o flexible Mat :)","Leather District"
"28645","The stay in Jazz's apartment helped me enjoy Boston even more because of the feeling of returning home. The loft is amzing. Jazz is restless in making you feel at home and at ease around town. The bed gives you the proper rest.","Leather District"
"28680","The place is exactly how it looks in the pictures, and Jazz is extremely firnedly and welcoming. I stayed for 8 days and she only slept at the apartment 2 or 3 nights. It is in a great location if you are looking to be near the convention center, I could walk there in 15-20 minutes. I also was able to walk to the Freedom trail and other attraction sites easily from her spot. The bed is super comfy, I was never cold and the place is immaculately clean. I would definetly recommend this rental again and again. ","Leather District"
"28646","This place is picture perfect. Great location, awesome aesthetic and the host is super thoughtful. Would stay here again---every time! ","Leather District"
"891.1","I came to this listing knowing it would be a small, cozy apartment almost like a student dorm with a small private bathroom. What I didn't expect was how filthy it was. First off, the location is awesome. It is in an area near a ton of universities and right around the corner are plenty of food places and a couple of bars. It's right next to the E-Train so you have access everywhere! There is even a grocery store and pharmacy a block away. I would of had a more positive experience if the apartment wasn't filthy. I checked in early and the previous tenant's used towel and linens were still in the room. I checked in early at noon instead of 1, so I didn't mind. The house manual says that Sean comes in about one time per day to change linens, around 3PM. I left for the day to return around 6PM and the room still had not been cleaned so I contacted our host who said he was unavailable to come at the moment. He ended up coming by later that night around 10:30PM after some pleading and changed the linen and the towels. The room had clean linen now, but the room was still dirty. There was a lot of dust, stains of dried sticky liquid accumulated with dirt under the bed, and the bathroom had bugs. Several bugs would show up in the bathroom and rest on the towels. When he came in that first night, he didn't clean the floors or the shower floor and with the addition of bugs in the bathroom, I did not feel comfortable and ended up not showering for the duration of my stay. I told Sean about the bugs and he said he """"was sorry I had to see that"""" and blamed it on the missing tiles which he said he was going to come in the next day to fix, which he did not. Later, there was a discrepancy with the lock box which I wanted to notify him about and he responded by insulting another tenant. Honestly, although he was very nice in person, I think he may have too much on his plate and is in turn neglecting his duties as a host on AirBnB and would therefore not recommend staying with him at all.","Mission Hill"
"16513","Nicolas was a great host and I loved the place. He was very responsive to communication and the place itself was cozy. And all the reviews about the comfortable bed are true!","Leather District"
"23747","Alexandra was really accommodating upon our arrival. She arranged to give us the keys even if she was not at home when we arrived.
She also allowed us to us the laundry machine, which we really appreciated!
The room is exactly as on the picture. The beds were actually air mattresses, which we did not noticed while reading the add... The room and the bathroom were clean.
The two negative points are that 1) the air conditioning conducts directly opens in the room and the air conditioning sometimes starts in the middle of the night blowing cold air on your face and making a lot of noise and 2) that the smell of the Subway restaurant spreads in the whole apartment.
Otherwise, the house was located close to the subway which was really convenient to go in town.  The neighborhood was great. There were some cafe and bars. There was also a supermarket close to the subway.
In my opinion, this place is nice for a short stay.","Mission Hill"
"28607","I stayed for 4 nights with Jazz.  She was a fantastic host, very friendly and helpful.  Her apartment is beautiful and  clean.  The bed is super comfortable.  And the location in perfect for exploring  Boston on foot, with great access to metro to commute to the surrounding area.","Leather District"
"40692","We stayed at Alexandra´s place for two nights, four people (two couples) and we rented out the two rooms. Issues as stated by other guests include: Subway smell, cleanliness of the bathroom and rooms, air conditionning always on (made a very loud noise in the room with the two  air beds) and locked with password.  We completely agree with Chases's review. ","Mission Hill"
"28537","This is a BEAUTIFUL apartment located very close to the train/bus station and a short walk to the convention center.  The apartment was extremely neat and clean.  The bedrooms are located along the interior of the building, so you will not deal with noise from outside.

Joe was excellent with communication and setup, and will make your stay go smoothly.  Since my train didn't leave until a few hours after checkout, he had no problem with us keeping our bags there until we left.

There is a great little restaurant and a wine bar across the street, and there is a store downstairs and slightly south on the same block as the apartment if you need to pick up any incidentals (or a bottle of wine).

It's a 3rd floor walk-up, so keep that in mind so you aren't surprised when you get there.

"15763","While affordable, you will make concessions stay in this studio. The bathroom needs a deep cleaning. The sink needs repair (it drips and previous guests have Macgyver'd a sponge to dampen the noise). The beautiful looking drafting table wasn't there when I stayed. The host interrupted me in the middle of my stay and asked if I wanted clean sheets... I would have appreciated a message beforehand that he would not have an opportunity to clean the studio before my arrival, and to expect him.","Mission Hill"

   The studio is small and basic. It  has what you need for a quick night's stay.  The bed is a twin. The pull-out bed doesn't make it a double. Excellent internet. He leaves terminal his on.
   Location: You're basically at Brigham and Women's hospital. We walked to the Pru Center in about 30 minutes. Lots of schools are closer than that. It's just a few easy blocks from Green Line metro/Brigham Circle. The 'T' is about five-10 minutes from downtown. 
   Very good stores such as a good Stop n'Shop supermarket and Walgreen pharmacy. Very good internet access..he leaves his computer on. 
   Drawback? Old building not a dream, but fine. Neighborhood is fairly dodgy, but I parked on the main drag unde street lights and around stores. No problem. 
   I'd go back for another stay.","Mission Hill"

"17806","I got the place because it was convenient and only a walking distance from BIMC.
However; I think it's way over priced I paid 6k for a one month stay and had to pay extra for parking . The whole building smells so bad. It takes forever to get on the elevator and when you do finally get on one you're like a sardine with 8 Indians from India or Arabs.
There was a sewage leak in the hallway for like 5 days.
For the amount of money I paid you'd think that you would have a washer or dryer but no. Also The bed was extremely uncomfortable. And college kids on the floor were loud most nights! 
Looking back i should've booked a hotel. It would've cost the same for a much pleasant experience.

It is a really easy, short walk from South Station and in a nice neighbourhood. Jazz is a wonderful host, very kind and helpful and her room is just beautiful.

She's very knowledgeable of the cool places in the city and she has great taste, don't forget to ask her for advises if you are looking for the best of Boston! Her artsy and comfy apartment is like a home in town, I'd strongly recommend it to all my friends.","Leather District"

"15713.1","Wir hatten eine gute Zeit bei Sean.

Die Schluesseluebergabe erfolgte nicht persoenlich sondern ueber eine lockbox, was den Vorteil hat, dass man unabhaengig von der Ankunftszeit in die Wohnung kann.

Zugegeben war der erste Eindruck, wenn man die Wohnung betritt, nicht der Beste, da das Studio und die Einrichtung nicht das/ die Neueste ist/ sind. Allerdings hat sich der Eindruck innerhalb kuerzester Zeit verfluechtigt! Alles hat problemlos funktioniert und wir haben uns in den 4 Tagen sehr wohl gefuehlt. 

Die Nachbarschaft und Umgebung war gut; wir haben uns jederzeit sicher gefuehlt.

Ausserdem hat das Studio eine gute Anbindung an die T (Tram und Ubahn in Boston).

Alles in allem trifft die Beschreibung von Sean zu 100% zu und wir koennen ihn und das Studio auf alle Faelle weiterempfehlen!

"12310.1","Veronica was great to deal with, prompt in her replies.  The apartment is small and has everything you need, as advertised.

There is no air conditioning in the unit and it was very uncomfortable on the hot days.  The apartment could also use a very thorough cleaning.  Cable was not available in the unit which was disappointing.  The bed was also very uncomfortable, I think it was a double bed on a queen frame.  

That said, it was the cheapest option in the area, so I think it's a get what you pay for scenario.","Mission Hill"
"36897","The apartment is accurately shown in photos. Ann was good to work with. A friend and I shared the place for a week.

Pros:
***Great location (5-10 minute walk to LMA; two T lines within 4 blocks; 2 T stops from MFA; supermarket, drugstore, and many places to get food nearby.
—Resides on a lovely, quiet street.
—Good amount of space, with separate dining area, and even a porch if you're there in the right weather.
—Two full baths (one quite large), one with bathtub. 
—Great water pressure; hot water plentiful.
—Nice linens.
—Good internet connection.
—Quiet.

Cons:
—Place needs updating. Master bed is small and sags in middle, many of the chairs sag, place is dusty and needs thorough cleaning and new paint job, as well as weeding out of kitchen drawers and cupboards. (It's not that the place is dirty, it's just that there is too much stuff in it, much of it old and not in the best condition. It's a bit like living in a used furniture shop; just the far side of eclectic.)
—Located up a steep Amsterdamesque staircase with no landing outside door. Not a good option for anyone with mobility or vertigo issues.
—If you plan to use sofa bed, ask Ann to bring an air mattress. She provided that for us, which was much appreciated.
—Cost a bit high for condition.

Having said that, I would probably stay there again as I found it overall comfortable and very convenient.","Mission Hill"

In terms of location, I came here for business and my office is a 10 minute walk away, but since Jazz's apartment is a five minute walk from South Station, I imagine it to be convenient for all other visitors as well. I will reach out to Jazz again for my next visit to Boston. Recommend it for everyone else!","Leather District"
"15595","Sean couldn't have been more accomodating.  He met up with us even though we got there later in the evening.  The place is in a great location right off of the train line, near museums and near a few great bars and shops.  That being said read the other reviews and you know what you're getting. It is what it is (It is literally a college dorm room)! You cannot beat the price and it was perfect for our weekend trip where we just needed a hot shower and a bed.  As for the bed itself it is a trundle bed that pulls out to make a queen bed, but the mattress is not comfortable on both sides. One side is very thin and lopsided.  The windows in the place are pretty this so be prepared to hear anything that goes on outside and if you go when it's cold, it can get a bit chilly (I couldn't find a thermostat anywhere in the joint)  for those reason it got 4 stars, but really We'd stay again if we went back! It's perfect for your minimalist travelers! ","Mission Hill"
"12939","I stayed in the flat of Yosef for two times over a couple of days in December 2014. It was a very clean, comfortable and well located place near Mission Hill with only 1 min. to go to the next tram/subway station (green line). Yosef and his roommate were perfect, very welcoming hosts, providing detail instructions prior to check in. I would go there anytime again.
Im Dezember 2014 wohnte ich (53, erste Erfahrung mit airbnb) zweimal für mehrere Tage in der Wohnung von Yosef und James. Yosef war in dieser Zeit bei seinen Eltern und ich wohnte in seinem Zimmer, was, wie die gesamte Wohnung, sehr sauber und komfortabel war. Die Lage nahe Mission Hill und die kurze Entfernung zur nächsten Straßenbahnhaltestelle (green line) waren perfekt, auch für Ausflüge in das Stadtzentrum.
Die Kommunikation vorab war schnell und ausführlich und das Einchecken absolut unproblematisch. Yosef und sein Mitbewohner James waren perfekte, freundliche und angenehme Gastgeber.
Bei meinem nächsten Aufenthalt in Boston würde ich diese Wohngelegenheit auf jeden Fall einem Hotel vorziehen und würde gerne wieder bei Yosef und James wohnen.
