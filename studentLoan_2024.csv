2024-02-13,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","My wife and I have Parent Plus loans for our children. This past XXXX, I was inquiring about the SAVE plan to get lowest payments. We asked very detailed and pointed questions and they said to consolidate all the loans. I did as they said but then found out about the Double Consolidation method to have Parent Plus loans be able to get on lower IDR Plan, instead of ICR Plan. Based on my calculations, the IDR plan would cost about XXXX XXXXXXXX or so as opposed to XXXX XXXX, currently. They are supposed to provide advice as it is very hard to figure out all the steps needed. I was misled and need to re-consolidate so i get the IDR through double-consolidation.

My issue is that college bound children are limited by FAFSA loans. The bulk is taken up by the parents so we should be eligible for IDR, under SAVE. That would only be fair as parents do not have financially feasible options with price of colleges, as I sent my kids to all state colleges. Plus, the calculations for ICR do not make sense, with the poverty level calculations as the middle class feels the financial hit.

What can you do to help so that I can consolidate the Parent Plus loans so that I can pay my monthly fee and not default due to high fees.","","Nelnet, Inc.","VA","223XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-13,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8337828,2024

I signed a contract with my employer to keep working for them for a number of years to make a large sum payment to my loan. I work for the federal government ( USDA ), and they sent a check that was never applied to my loan. I was on the phone 4-5 different times to follow up on where the money was because my employer said the check had been cashed, but never applied. The check was sent in XXXX, and I have provided the follow up asking where the money was and no responses ever to the written messages. And on the phone the provider said they were just backlogged with work. I received a message from my employer saying the funds were returned to them this XXXX. I have called the loan servicing provider 10+ times over the course of the last 2 weeks and can not get ahold of a live person to discuss why they were never applied like I was assured they would be.

2024-01-19,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","I am having issues with Mohela and Public Student Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ). I have been a XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX for XXXX  years. I have taken out student loans to further my education and move up the pay scale as a XXXX  in XXXX. This is the only way to earn more money as a XXXX in the state of Arizona. The Department of Education, under Biden 's administration, implemented a PSLF waiver in early XXXX to help public servants gain years of credit toward complete student loan forgiveness under the PSLF program. Mohela ( and the Dept of Education ) refuses to count 2 and a half years of payments I made toward my student loans, from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX need 120 payments to obtain complete student loan forgiveness. I should already have more than 120 payments. 

If the Mohela and the DOE  would count my student loan payments during the years of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I would have significantly more than the 120 payments needed on my PSLF tracker right now. I would qualify for loan forgiveness immediately! However, the DOE and Mohela will not count these years of payments. I have called Mohela every month ( since XXXX XXXX ) to find out why these months are not being counted toward PSLF. I am on hold for hours EACH time I call. Every Mohela representative I speak to tells me something different each time I call. The Mohela reps have absolutely NO idea what they are doing. Most reps I speak to are completely incompetent and they seem to make stuff up because they don't know what else to say and have no idea what to do. Some days I call Mohela, and I get disconnected with no call back. It is beyond frustrating! When I call the Department of Education, they have no idea what they are doing either. No one can give me any answers! I do not know what else to do or who else to contact. 

The representatives Ive spoken to at Mohela tell me that they can see in my account history that I did, in fact, make payments during those years. The Mohela representatives dont know why these years are not included on my PSLF tracker. They tell me something different EVERY time I call. I was in repayment status during the years of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, but no one will give me credit for these years of payments! The Department of Education will not give me answers either. 

I have already made more than 120 months of student loan payments needed for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, but Mohela will NOT count 2 and a half years of payments I made. I even have sent in my bank statements to show them that I made payments in XXXX, XXXX and the first part of XXXX! Meanwhile, I had to start making large student loan payments back in XX/XX/XXXX because every representative I speak to is incompetent and I never get accurate answers. I just need answers and I need to know why they refuse to give me credit for 2 and a half years of payments that I made. My student loans should have already been forgiven.

I called 2 more times. Same result. 
Contacting Mohela is very difficult. I need to figure out how to pay the so called """" past due '' amount. I keep paying them via their online platform and they keep saying I am still late. This month they are saying I am late. IMPOSSIBLE! I am paying what they are telling me to pay! Including whenever they say I am late. 

I was told by a financial advisor to look into consolidating my loans so that I can be granted another loan servicer. I am in the process of doing that. I am sick and tired of this every month! The amounts change from month to month and the automated system says I owe {$97.00} dollars for this month, but the bill for this month says {$100.00}. 

Then it says I owe {$56.00} past due since XX/XX/2023. I paid what the website said what was due!!! 

When I try making a payment via the automated service, I wait for the long automated update regarding long wait times and that they are transferring my account to a new platform and that I should wait for them to contact me. So, I press 1 to make a payment and then press 2 to pay specifically my so called """" past due '' amount. When I press 2, it automatically takes me to customer service and then the long wait begins again. After waiting a long time, the call is suddenly disconnected by Mohela. 

When I pay my bill -- - the """" current amount '' is only paid. There are no options on the website or way to confirm that I am paying both the so called """" past due '' amount along with the current. I do not even know how I am past due as I have been paying monthly.

The dates of employment I submitted are entered in incorrectly, the amounts owed have changed drastically over the past several months, and I have made XXXX payments of the XXXX required but only XXXX are counting. This system and the rules are confusing and difficult to access so I overpaid for years. All of these extra payments have been deemed ineligible because it was during forbearance but I was working full-time at my university then so they should count. Last month I got a notification that XXXX payments out of XXXX counted. Every month I get drastically different information about whether my payments count and how much I currently owe. 

On the main account page it says my next payment of {$330.00} is due on XX/XX/2028 because of all the extra payments but I just got a statement saying that {$1100.00} is past due from last month. Which one is it? And shouldn't all of my extra payments be applied toward loan forgiveness? 

It is impossible to get someone on the phone ( I have tried 3 times and I get disconnected or never called back or called back at times when I can not pick up ) and unclear what I should be doing now. 

The bottom line is that I have made many more payments than I needed to in order to qualify for loan forgiveness and my loans should be forgiven.

They were supposed to reach out about that. But they didn't. Now I'm getting mail from the US Department of Education about my missed payment. This has to stop but I feel like I can't get traction. I fear this mistake will affect my credit record and my standing with the Department of Education, particularly if there ever is a forgiveness for accounts NOT past due. This needs to be corrected once and for all and cleared from my record. I want to ensure that the Department of Education is notified of the mistake and the credit bureaus are as well.","","Maximus Education, LLC dba Aidvantage","CO","80112","Older American","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-25,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8415637,2024

XXXX XXXX XXXX : Good afternoon, my name is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX writing to you to express extreme concern, confusion, frustration and total disappointment with how we have been treated and serviced by Citizens Bank and XXXX XXXX! 

To keep this year long struggle brief, my son upon needing to repay his Student Loan back via a consolidation of multiple loans, XXXX, my wife and myself followed protocol to complete all steps as directed in order to get one loan payment and begin the process on his obligation. We were told a number of times that additional steps and information were needed to complete the application, to which we immediately replied to! We continued to follow up and told by representatives that the loan was in process or, the information was never received! We again followed up competing the information request and repeatedly were told it was not received! In addition in talking with other reps, they acknowledged that the information was received and the process was in place. This went on for several months! 

We now find ourselves receiving calls from Collection Agencies and Law Offices to work out a payment arrangement within a specific time, suggesting we exhaust our XXXX XXXX and mortgaging our home, as this has destroyed our credit. We were totally blindsided by these actions and we in good faith, co-signed for our son so he could receive financing to get a college education in this competitive world we live in! We are honorable people who never had any intentions for this to escalate to this level, or to mortgage our lives away as I am a few years from XXXX  and have had some recent health issues requiring XXXX. 

I ask of you to please take this into strong consideration and to have a one point of contact, qualified person to reach out to resolve this matter so we can do this as originally intended.

Your prompt reply would be greatly appreciated in hopes of your understanding our frustration and intent to resolve!

The PSFL promises repayment of loans after 10 years/120 payments. I have made 12 years of qualifying payments. In addition, 3 years during COVID provisions should have been counted as well. 

I contacted Mohela, my loan service provider, when my federal loans were transferred to this agency to ensure my payment and PSFL dates were correct. 

The only way to communicate with this agency is to message them on their website. My first communication was responded to promptly and my employment was verified. The second message, asking for clarification as to why my loans were not yet forgiven was not responded to in over 1 month. The response was not an answer to my question. 

However, a month or so later, I got a letter stating some of my loans were forgiven. I am thankful for this. Unfortunately, these loans originated after other loans on my account which should have also been forgiven. Correspondence regarding this has not been addressed by Mohela. My response stated that payments were not counted towards my loan due to deferment. My loans were indeed in deferment while I was in my XXXXXXXX XXXX  beginning in XXXX. However, payments before that time were not accounted for correctly and my COVID relief credit was not applied either.

I have the paperwork from XXXX, indicating the loans were paid in full by the guarantor, dated XXXX, as well as the letter from the US Dept of Education, Federal Student Aid dated XX/XX/XXXX confirming the loans were discharged.

I contacted Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that they mainta a database and that is where the information is listed. They were not able to confirm where the info loaded into their database comes from. They were not able to provide any further assistance. I contacted the US Dept Ed on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that they weren't able to assist as they don't manage Nelnet content and since the loans were dischared from the Federal Student Aid Dept I would have to contact that division. The representative did provide an email of XXXX to notify and get direction. I sent an email and never received a response. I contacted Nelnet again on XX/XX/XXXX and was told I would receive a letter and that apparently the student loan database was not updated. I received no letter. I contacted NSLDS on XX/XX/XXXX who sent me to the Federal Student Aid Loan discharge and cancellation department who advised me I should contact XXXX as they were the loan provdier before Nelnet. I have the XXXX coupon book and account info originally provided to me. I contacted XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and was told to send an email to XXXX for assistance. 

I received a response from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX indicating there is no account listed under my name with the last XXXX digits of my SSN. They directed me to the NSLDS website to search for a history of my federal student loans. I was instructed to login with an FSA ID and password or create one. I have tried multiple tines over the last several months to access https : //nslds.ed.gov as instructed and the site never loads. I have tried different deviceds and always receive an error/Not found message.

This is extremely frustrating as we have everything in hand to confirm these loans were discharged through proper channels back in XXXX after having initiated the process in XXXX. I can't get anyone to take ownership of resolving this issue and the several institutions I have connected with can't even find my information.

I was told that I owed {$2400.00} for interest that accrued over several months during my deferment while I was still in school. I called ECSI to ask what my regular monthly payment would be once I made the lump sum interest payment, and was told that the {$2400.00} would be my monthly payment amount as well. I responded that this monthly payment amount was too high for a {$25000.00} student loan. The customer service representative continued to argue that it was correct and I asked to speak with a supervisor. I was told that no supervisor was available, then I was placed on hold while the representative conferred with another team member. When the representative returned, she told me that if I paid the {$2400.00} interest that accrued, I would get a statement the following month showing me my regular monthly payment- which would likely be around {$500.00} or so a month. I used my income tax return to make said payment, and the following month I received a statement from ECSI stating that my next monthly payment is again {$2400.00}. I also wrote and mailed a letter to the company asking to be contacted about this unreasonably high payment and was never contacted. In addition, last year this company sent me to collections for just over {$700.00} in interest without ever notifying me by mail, email, or phone that I owed this amount. Again, I got nowhere with their customer service and had to write letters to the three major credit bureaus. After contacting these bureaus, suddenly my account was no longer in default.

During this time, from XXXX of XXXX through XXXX of XXXX, I continued paying my minimum payment that was due every month because I was under the impression that the life of my loan was going to be extended if I didn't pay. They continued to deposit this money every month without notifying me via mail or phone call or email that I didn't need to pay. During the summer of XXXX I applied for loan forgiveness. I spoke with multiple people at Mohela during this time and all of them stated that I would be reimbursed for those payments because I didn't need to pay them and that the federal government had a policy for repayment. They told me to wait for my loan to be forgiven ( I had applied for XXXX and was in the process of waiting ) because I had already made over XXXX payments. They all assured me that I needed to wait out the process and then fill out the appropriate reimbursement paperwork after my loan was forgiven. I called to follow up again in XX/XX/XXXX and during this phone call they told me that my loan was officially forgiven and that they will reimburse me for XXXX payments ( because I made XXXX payments ). During the same phone call they also told me that the window for applying for reimbursement for payments made during the covid payment pause closed in XX/XX/XXXX and that I can no longer apply for reimbursement. This company deposited all my payments from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX and the amount they owe me is approximately {$13000.00} ( they reimbursed me for my last XXXX payments ). Every time I have called since, they try to transfer me to a supervisor. I have never been able to speak to one. I have left my phone number for call back multiple times and have received no follow-up. They are at fault because they never should've taken my money to begin with.

I called Nelnet on XXXX and spoke with XXXX, who recalculated my monthly payment and stated that I should be on the SAVE plan with a monthly payment of XXXX XXXX.

2024-03-22,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","Chronology of Events : - In XX/XX/XXXX, I applied and was approved for the income-driven repayment program, REPAYE, which commenced on XX/XX/XXXX, with an agreed monthly payment of approximately {$360.00}. 
- In XX/XX/XXXX, the REPAYE plan transitioned to the SAVE plan, under which my payments continued smoothly. 
- Without any request or justifiable cause from my end, in XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that my loan had been erroneously switched from the SAVE plan to the LEVEL plan by MOHELA, resulting in a disproportionate monthly charge of {$1900.00}. I had not requested to be taken off the SAVE plan, nothing about my situation had changed that would have warranted being taken off the SAVE plan, and it had only been a few months since being on it ( not the 12 months that might have caused a change in plan ). 
- Upon raising this issue with MOHELA 's customer service representatives ( on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ), I was informed of the mistake and promised correction. My account was temporarily placed on processing forbearance while awaiting re-enrollment in the SAVE plan. It was affirmed that the forbearance period would count towards my PSLF eligibility. 
- Despite these assurances, in XX/XX/XXXX, I was again charged {$1900.00}. A refund request made in XXXX was inexplicably canceled ; a subsequent request in XX/XX/XXXX remains unresolved. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX, confirmation was received from a MOHELA representative that there was no basis for the initial switch from the SAVE to LEVEL plan in XX/XX/XXXX, acknowledging the error. SAVE payments are set to resume in XX/XX/XXXX, five months after improperly being taken off SAVE.

Key Issues : - Erroneous Plan Switch : I was unjustly removed from the SAVE plan, resulting in a more than fivefold increase in my monthly payments.

- Impact on PSLF Eligibility : The undue forbearance period from XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, due to MOHELA 's delay in reinstating the SAVE plan, jeopardizes my PSLF payment count. I propose to rectify this by making retroactive payments under the SAVE plan for the affected months. 
- Customer Service Failures : Addressing this situation has consumed an inordinate amount of my time, aggravated by lengthy wait times, inadequate information from customer service representatives, and impractical callback practices from supervisors. 
Requested Resolution : This complaint is submitted in the hope of receiving a prompt and fair resolution to the issues outlined. I trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will assist in rectifying these errors and ensuring that such discrepancies do not recur, affecting borrowers ' financial well-being and their trust in the loan servicing process.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","CA","XXXXX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-22,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8604164,2024

I am writing to bring to your attention a concerning discrepancy I have encountered with my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX tracker. I have diligently been monitoring my progress towards loan forgiveness, and I recently noticed a significant error that has left me confused and anxious about my future eligibility. All payments prior to XX/XX/XXXX are not showing in the payment history and counting towards my XXXX 

Originally, as of XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX tracker indicated that I had XXXX qualifying payments left before achieving loan forgiveness. However, to my surprise, the tracker now reflects that I have XXXX payments remaining. This discrepancy has raised considerable concerns, as I have been making consistent efforts to ensure the accuracy of my payments and stay on track with the XXXX program. 

In my pursuit of resolving this issue, I have taken the necessary steps to ensure my eligibility. I have submitted the XXXX form multiple times, as my employer, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, does not facilitate electronic signatures and requires manual submission. I have been continuously employed as a XXXX teacher with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX since my start date in XX/XX/XXXX. Throughout my tenure, I have maintained an unbroken service record, without any interruptions or gaps in my employment. 

Based on my own calculations, I should have approximately XXXX qualifying payments remaining towards achieving loan forgiveness. I understand the importance of accurate tracking within the XXXX program, and I am committed to fulfilling all requirements in order to receive the loan forgiveness I have been working towards. 

Given the significance of this matter and the potential impact on my financial future, I kindly request your prompt attention and resolution of this issue. I am open to providing any additional information or documentation that may be required to rectify the error and ensure the accuracy of my XXXX tracker. 

I am grateful for your understanding and assistance in resolving this matter. Your guidance will provide much-needed clarity and peace of mind during this uncertain time. Please advise me on the necessary steps to rectify this situation and continue progressing towards my goal of loan forgiveness.

2024-02-29,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Problem with customer service","My student loans, like most other people 's, started repayment back in XXXX. Because of them not doing what they were supposed to do, none of the information showed up to properly repay the loan. I had submitted an application for income based repayment to lower my payments and even after receiving that information they had my monthly payments at about {$250.00}. Needless to say, when I contacted them, they said that was incorrect and my application was not processed. I checked the website multiple times to find out if I was missing any information and based on the website and speaking to a couple different people with mohela, it did not look like I was missing anything. For some reason unbeknownst to me, I had to resubmit my w-2. I did what I was supposed to do again and my payments were lowered to about {$60.00} a month. They told me that I did not have to pay my loans back until XXXX and then they told me I had to pay in XXXX. Because of that misinformation on their part, my budget was not ready to start repaying that loan until XXXX. When I called mohela, the woman I spoke with told me that I could file a forbearance in order to cancel my payments for a few months while I got my finances in order to budget paying this loan again. My forbearance application was filed in XXXX and it is now almost XXXX with no information from them, except constant emails about me having missed payments. I have called Mohela about six times since XXXXXXXX XXXX application was filled out. Each time I speak with them someone tells me something different. One woman told me that I was missing information and she had to transfer me to the correct department. The correct apartment told me I was not missing any information and that Mohela just has not done anything about my application. Another time I was told it could take 90 business days for them to even look at my application. I think it's funny that I'm expected to do everything on time or else but they can't even process my application in a timely manner 90 business days is outrageous to have to wait for an application to be approved or denied as there are only about 20 business days in a month. Every single time I call them I am literally waiting on hold for at least 45 minutes just to have somebody tell me that there's nothing more than I need to do. I don't understand how I have missed three payments and they can send me emails about that, but they can not process my forbearance application. I only needed a few months to get my things in order but now I'm about {$200.00} overdue because they can't either accept nor deny my forbearance application.

When I did that I did not realize that I was put into a forbearance. I contacted MOHELA in late XX/XX/ 2023 to say I did not want the forbearance and wanted to restart repayment immediately. I was told that wasn't a problem but it could take a few months for the forbearance to drop off but as long as I went online and manually made the payments they would be counted as eligible. The forbearance fell off in late XX/XX/2023 and the XXXX  2023 payment auto-debited from my account and showed as qualifying for PSLF. In XXXX or XXXX the XX/XX/2023 payment which I made switched from ineligible to eligible as it was no longer listed as being in forbearance. The XXXX payment was still listed as being in forbearance though even though I made the payment. I contacted MOHELA and was told by a representative they say the notes and it would still be taken care of but they could only change the status of XXXX payment per month and it would be resolved the following month. Currently the XX/XX/ 2023 payment is still showing as ineligible due to deferment or forbearance. I spoke with MOHELA again today and was told that even though they put the forbearance XXXX and resolved the issue for the XXXX payment they couldn't do so for the XXXX payment and the Federal Student Aid was responsible for the payment counts. I have also spoke with FSA and they say because MOHELA says they have in forebearance they can not count the payment until MOHELA says the payment period was not in forbearance. I have gotten nothing but runaround and excuses from MOHELA for months. Today I was told they could submit a form to accounting but it would be rejected.

2024-02-01,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","I have worked in public service since XXXX but due to the type of loan repayment I was on I was unable to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. I had decided to just make larger payments to pay off the loan rather than switch repayment since I would be putting more towards the principal each month. I had been serviced by XXXX  XXXX from XXXX to XXXX. I had applied in XXXX to PSLF and was denied due to the repayment schedule. I had done the math and I would end up paying more if I switched due to the payments I had already made and the monthly payment amount. 

When the covid payment pause went into effect I continued to pay since I could finally make a real dent in the principal since the interest was frozen. I made 28 payments of {XXXX} during this time. In XXXX on XXXX I was finally able to qualify for PSLF thanks to the limited waiver program. At that time my loans were moved to Mohela. I had no way to continue to make payments at that time due to the payment freeze and being a new client without and owed balance. I therefore waited till repayment started before continuing to pay. I had received notification that I had made 113 qualifying payments at the time of my approval into the program in XX/XX/XXXX. I was never notified that the covid pause was counted as payments at any point by XXXX, Federal Student Aid, or Mohela. I have gone back and re-read all of my communications and this was never listed. On XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX was the first reference to these paused payments counting toward the PSLF program in an email about starting repayment. At this time I sent a message on XX/XX/XXXX to Mohela referencing this email and asking if this mea n't I was done paying my loan. I was informed in the auto response they would respond in 15 days. They responded on XXXX XXXX 43 days later, saying that these covid paused payments did count and that I had to recertify to update my qualifying payment count. 

I immediately rectified and was notified on XX/XX/XXXX that I had 126 qualifying payments, not 113. This was the first time I was made away that these non-paid paused payments counted. At this time I immediately called and requested my full payment history since I knew I had over paid in the XXXX as well as during covid. At no time did they mention not being able to request this as a refund. I immediately requested the 2 payments I had made in XXXX and XXXX of XXXX since they were over the required 120 payments needed for forgiveness. Since my loans had moved from XXXX to Mohela I had no way of seeing my past payment history to know how much I had overpaid throughout the many years. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I finally received my full payment history in the mail. It was at that time I was able to see that I had overpaid {$6800.00} total, XXXX} of that being paid during the covid pause. At that time I immediately looked up how to request a refund and was only then notified that refunds could no longer be requested after XX/XX/XXXX for payments made during the covid pause. At that time I went and searched every email and conversation with any servicer and not one mentioned a refund, this date, that these months were counted whether and actual payment was made or not, no reference in any communication at any time. The first and only reference was in an email sent after the refund date had passed and it did not directly what was and was not counted or that refunds had been issued or that the refund time ended. I am attaching this email and the other referenced communications. 

I have spoken to Mohela and informed them of this and they informed me they were aware there was no notification but that they could not process a refund for this {$4900.00} due to the XXXX XXXX XXXX refund deadline passing. 

My complaint is that whether the refund can be requested or not, I was not notified at any time about any part of these paused payments counting or refunds being requested until after the deadline. This {$4900.00} is there for not a payment made towards my loan but funds being held XXXX and not being applied to any debt. From the time I was able to qualify for the program I stopped payments so these were not payments made in error, these were payments made with the good faith effort to repay a debt I had no reason to believe would ever be forgiven. 

I believe there for it is illegal for these funds to be held whether the refund time has passed or not given the lack of transparency and the immediate action upon notification on my part. Please advise on how best to proceed with this complaint to resolve this issue for myself and for what is surely millions of others who also attempted to repay this debt. I am simply requesting the {$4900.00} back as it is not being applied towards moneys owed.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","KY","417XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-01,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",8268538,2024

My previous employer had made an initial error in paperwork which I didn't catch unfortunately until after I submitted and got denied the first time. I spoke to a representative in XX/XX/XXXX and they said to simply resubmit the application with the corrected information and signature from employer. Since then I've had the form denied and canceled 2 times because they considered it """" duplicate '' once in XX/XX/XXXX and another in XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to a """" specialist '' at Mohela in XX/XX/XXXX regarding the particular situation and they put in a """" request to review, recalculate, and update my payment tracker '' because he saw that it was a corrected form and indeed not a duplicate and confirmed it was an approved employer. He told me I wouldn't get any notification until the information was updated. When I called today, XX/XX/XXXX to check on the status since I didn't see an update to my tracker, the representative today said the request to review was """" canceled, '' but could not tell me why.

2024-01-23,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","I XXXX from a XXXX program in XXXX of 2023. My loans were going to resume in XXXX of 2023. I work at a XXXX that qualifies under Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ). I submitted paperwork for Income Drive Repayment plan ( IDR ) on XX/XX/2023. They claimed processing takes 5-10 business days. Shortly after, my loans were placed under administrative forbearance. I saw that in XXXX, I had a payment of ~ {$320.00} due, later to find out that was because it was not under the direct loan that is in consideration for IDR. Still, I made the payment, only to find out in early XXXX in the first of my XXXX phone calls to date, that since my account is in forbearance, no payment is due. I clarified the rules of PSLF, IDR, what constitutes, how much it will be, and that it is taking longer than normal. A few weeks went by, and at the end of XXXX I checked to see that my account was delinquent and saying I missed a payment of {$1800.00}. My account was in forbearance and should not have been in a payment period. I again called, and they verified that this was a mistake and that they will further notify that my account is in forbearance. This happened XXXX times in XXXX and as it turns out, phone calls XXXX were employees under training and were placing individual loans into forbearance, not the entire collection of my loans. I was assured that IDR was taking time because they were behind schedule. Additionally, I had signed up for Auto-debit to save interest. In late XXXX, I received notification that on XX/XX/XXXX, an {$1800.00} would be due because I had """" missed '' a payment. I went online to suspend my auto-debit so that the money would not be removed. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, my bank notified me that {$1800.00} was removed from my account, while I was on forbearance without IDR completed. I called MOHELA, again, and basically XXXX, a resolutions officer, said it was their mistake, they can not refund the money, only give it back within 30-60 business days. They attempted to swoon me to consolidate loans, but that was not my problem that they could not keep up. So, losing nearly {$2000.00} and an additional {$320.00} that I did not have to pay, I wanted to have call logs released to me, which she stated they could not unless court ordered. My sales force tracking number from the call with XXXX and the complaint she filed on my behalf was XXXX. 

Frustrated, I wanted to move on and get solution fixed. When my IDR was completed, it was higher than expected and it has been XXXX weeks since I have been able to get into contact. Long holds, no call backs, and still, my autodebit is not cancelled, and attached will be photos -- when I click """" cancel auto debit '' it says a payment is already processing, which would be XXXX weeks before due date, but when I click """" suspend auto debit '' a message appears that """" there is no payment due '' making contradictory statements. I called to speak to MOHELA ( XXXX XXXX ) on Friday XX/XX/XXXX and waited on hold for an hour and spoke to a representative. I told them I want a supervisor immediately regarding my payment and issues, and was told they would call me back. I received a call on Monday XX/XX/XXXX by a supervisor, but unfortunately I was in the operating room at work and asked if they could call me today, Tuesday the XXXX or Wednesday. The statement was """" No, we can not, you will have to call again as this case will be closed ''. That is the disregard, arrogance, and incompetence this company functions. Meanwhile, I have lost > {$2000.00}, I have not received credit for XXXX possible PSLF payments, and exerted time and energy on something that has been a large stressor. I want to contact the Missouri Attorney General, I want them to take responsibility, I want credit for PSLF payments, and I want someone to answer my questions and take accountability for their horrendous mismanagement, that they already admitted in XXXX. They are flirting with fraudulent business tactics at this point. I can not even remove my bank account without adding a new one for the auto debit payment. Attached will only be some of the correspondence notifications I have received. My IDR is still incorrect. I have called XXXX times today alone, on hold twice, and in the morning a customer service representative transferred me to a sueprvisor where I was placed on hold and told to leave call back number. That was at XXXX eastern time.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","SC","29455","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-23,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8208376,2024

2024-03-25,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Struggling to repay your loan","Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","There are a couple issues involved with this complaint about my federal student loans and PSLF : 1. I have federal loans from an undergraduate and graduate  education. As per the MOHELA website, my original principal balance I took out to cover these degrees was {$110000.00}. At some point during my education when I was on a forbearance due to being a student in school, a lot of interest was capitalized and added to the principal. The principal total is now {$130000.00} and I don't understand why. I tried calling Student Aid and MOHELA, and I was hung up on by the phone system because there are so many callers at once. I keep reading there is an XX/XX/XXXX deadline to consolidate in order to get a benefit or help for student debt, but the information online isn't clear about what I should or shouldn't consolidate, and I need more help than I'm getting from the website and phone representatives. I currently have 3 consolidated loans and I'm not sure if I should consolidate those 3 together into 1, or will that ruin my PSLF progress? Which leads me to the second part of the issue... 

2. I'm trying very hard to work towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness. I was laid off from my PSLF-eligible employer in XXXX  due to the pandemic and it took me 2.5 years to find another eligible employer full time, so I lost 2 years of payments. I called to ask if I could get credit for this time but I was told no, even though I've heard of pandemic credits being given out. Next year will mark 10 years since I graduated with a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and I've been working for XXXX XXXX employers full times as much as possible -- except for the 2.5 years of the pandemic, and desperately need help attaining credit for those 2.5 years so that I can gain PSLF.

2024-02-26,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","MOHELA committed financial fraud in XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment to MOHELA and requested my remaining balance for both principle and interest. The agent, XXXX ( XXXX # XXXX ), stated that my principle was {$10000.00} and that my interest was {$0.00}. I asked her to repeat these numbers several times to ensure they were correct and accurate. This conversation was recorded. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I telephoned MOHELA again ands spoke with, XXXX  ( XXXX # XXXX ), regarding my physical bill, which was mailed via U.S. Post office and therefore constitutes a notarized legal document. The bill states that my principle balance is now {$10000.00}. The bill does not list any interest as I have enrolled in the fraudulent SAVE plan. Upon review, MOHELA stated that my principle balance is {$10000.00}, and my interest is {$33.00} USD. When questioned about the discrepancy I was initially informed that I was told a different number. Specifically, the number listed on my physical invoice. After informing the agent that I had recorded the conversation, I was subsequently informed that this was an alleged accident, and not illegal conduct being willfully concealed by MOHELA. 

This is fraud. This is wire fraud. This is financial fraud. 


This is a violation of 34 CFR 685.102, 34 CFR 685.200, 34 CFR 685.220, 34 CFR 30.1-30.70, 34 CFR 685.206, 34 CFR 685.222, 34 CFR 668.171- 668.176, 34 CFR 685.204, 34 CFR 685.208, FDCPA 1692-1692p, FDCPA 801 819, and 15 USC 1601. 

MOHELA is legally obligated to report updates, adjustments, and payments to debt amounts on the first of each month, and in a correct as well as accurate manner. 

This false information is also a violation of CA civil code statutes AB 376, AB 1864, SB 908, 1788.101 ( a ), 1788.101 ( b ) ( 1 ) - ( 6 ), 1788.101 ( b ) ( 7 ) - ( 10 ), 1788.102, 1788.102 ( b ), 1788.102 ( c ) - ( d ), 1788.102 ( e ), 1788.102 ( f ), 1788.102 ( g ), 1788.102 ( h ), 1788.102 ( i ) and ( k ), 1788.102 ( j ), 1788.102 ( l ), 1788.102 ( m ), 1788.102 ( n ), 1788.102 ( o ) - ( r ), 1788.102 ( s ), and 1788.102 ( t ). 


Furthermore, this is not a duplicate reporting of fraud. This is an additional unique instance of fraud conducted by MOHELA. This company continues to engage in fraud as an attempt to act as a subsidy for the U.S. Treasury department. 
Finally, I was informed that MOHELA is unable to provide an accommodation in compliance with the ADA ( 1990 ). I was informed that MOHELA is unable to provide physical copies of my receipt notarized by the U.S. Postal Service. This is a violation of CA AB 376, Special disclosure requirements for private education loans law 1026.46 ( b ) ( 5 ), and 34 C.F.R.

2024-02-19,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Struggling to repay your loan","Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","I have been employed in public service for over 20 years and in student loan debt for just as long. Specifically, I have worked in public service at a qualifying employer prior to the implementation of PSLF in XXXX  until now. As such, I would have been eligible as of XXXX. Fed Loan was my loan servicer. As a loan servicer, it was difficult to get information about PSLF/repayment plans as well as their ever-changing criteria. I was always told I had the wrong loan type or repayment plan resulting in my payments not counting towards PSLF. 
The Cares Act suspended student loan payments and waived interest between XXXX and XXXX. However, I made consistent payments during this time. Additionally, I was able to qualify for loan forgiveness solely due to the temporary changes made to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) program between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 
In XXXX, my loans were forgiven and I was determined eligible for PSLF as of XXXX. As I believed my eligibility date should have been XXXX, I sent verification of my qualifying employment during XXXX to FedLoan and Department of Education as they both instructed for reconsideration of my PSLF eligibility date. As stated, Ive gotten emails from FedLoan indicating that there was a refund of payments that supposedly came in a lump sum but they refused to provide additional information such as deposit details or verification. I have filed complaints about them with the Department of Education to no avail. 
Neither corrected my PSLF eligibility date NOR issued a refund for any and all payments made since XXXX. Immediately upon being notified of the forgiveness, I no longer had online access to view my payment history on FedLoans website. I attempted to contact FedLoan by phone and email spending countless hours on hold and back & forth emails with no resolution. I am due a refund for overpayments since XXXX. Fed Loan redirected me to the Department of Education, and vice versa. FedLoan insisted they issued a refund but provided no other information and consistently redirected me to the Treasury Department. I am due a refund in excess of {$12000.00} plus interest. They should incur the same late fees and penalties we have to incur as borrowers in this student loan debt scheme. I am long overdue a refund for all overpayment/payments made since XXXX. 
Conveniently, FedLoan discontinued their loan servicing while outstanding debts are owed and transferred accounts to XXXX. I have made several efforts to contact FedLoan Servicing prior to their discontinuation of loan servicing. I was told my account would not transfer to XXXX since my loans were forgiven, however, I received correspondence from XXXX stating that my PSLF is under review. I contacted XXXX by phone for additional information but there is no record of me/my accounts in their system. There continues to be a lack of communication and transparency.","","AES/PHEAA","LA","705XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-19,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8373209,2024

As my recertification anniversary is indicated as XX/XX/XXXX, I believe that, according to this policy, my recertification should not be due until XX/XX/XXXX. However, I have been in communication with MOHELA, and they assert that my recertification date is XX/XX/XXXX. They have informed me that I must recertify immediately, or I will be enrolled in the standard repayment plan. Despite my attempts to seek clarification and resolution, I have not received a satisfactory response, and my request to speak with a supervisor remains unfulfilled. I understand and acknowledge the importance of recertification and am willing to comply when appropriate. However, it appears that MOHELA is not aligning with the recertification structure mandated by the federal government. I kindly request your assistance in resolving this matter and ensuring that the recertification process is conducted in accordance with the federal guidelines. Your prompt attention to this issue is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Follow up : I recently had another conversation with MOHELA regarding my student loan repayment schedule, and I am seeking futher assistance in resolving a discrepancy. During our discussion, MOHELA mentioned that my """" soft recertification '' date is set for XX/XX/XXXX, and the """" hard date '' is XX/XX/XXXX. Furthermore, they indicated that my next payment due and repayment option 's next tier commence on XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately, my request to escalate the matter to a supervisor for additional verification was declined, deeming my reasoning as """" inappropriate. '' Upon reviewing the information available on the FSA website, I understand that my IDR anniversary date, or recertification date, is scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. This contrasts with MOHELA 's assertion of a recertification date on XX/XX/XXXX, which coincides with the first payment date -- a month after the recertification deadline. I am seeking clarification on whether it is standard practice or appropriate for a """" hard recertification '' date and the first date of repayment to align. I apologize for the frequency of my communication, but I believe providing comprehensive information is crucial for a clear understanding of the situation. Your guidance on the next steps I should take would be immensely valuable. Thank you for dedicating your time to review my concerns Most recently, my monthly payment has increased from $ 199 monthly to {$3500.00}, due XX/XX/XXXX, since I did not recertify - as the FSA webpage suggested I did not need to.

I have experienced incredibly long processing delays, relaying of incorrect information from MOHELA representatives over phone calls, instances of MOHELA representatives telling me I am on administrative forbearance when I have not been placed on it even after requesting it on many phone calls and being placed on hold for hours. I was also given incorrect information by a MOHELA representative during my consolidation application was being processed and was told via phone that ALL of my loans were forgiven and """" no action is needed ''. This is not what is reflected in my account. Every agent I have spoken to has provided different information and I was incorrectly denied an IDR application. I have been asked to recertify income 4 times now in XXXX without any progress made on being placed on the appropriate IDR plan. Additionally, I should have been on an XXXX plan prior to my loans being transferred to MOHELA when they were with Great Lakes. Since XX/XX/XXXX I have spent XXXX hours on phone calls, emails, and documentation updates as a result of these inefficiencies and my account reflects this poor service with the increased interest added. Additionally, my PSLF forms have not been updated appropriately on my account, and my payment count is lower than it should be. I am documenting every conversation I have with MOHELA representatives in writing and will keep my records or conflicting information provided and I will be utilizing this information as I continue to submit documentation to support my PSLF forgiveness.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","OR","97035","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-10,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8138177,2024

I am pursuing public service loan forgiveness and had to call on XX/XX/XXXX to request a temporary forbearance for one month until my new recertified payment starts.

2024-03-27,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Problem with customer service","I applied for the SAVE plan on XX/XX/XXXX. I am on an income driven repayment plan but am trying to lower the monthly payment. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to MOHELA representative XXXX at approximately XXXXXXXX XXXX who stated there was an error on their end and my application would be reprocessed within 15 business days. He did not advise me to make any changes to my current application. He then transferred me to a female billing representative to get additional information. The female representative indicated my application had been assigned yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX and it should be fully processed within 15 business days. She did not advise that I had to make any changes to my current application. She advised my new payment had already been calculated and it was {$100.00}. She stated if I did not receive confirmation it had been processed to call back. She disclosed all the loan information to me at that time. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, at approximately XXXXXXXX XXXX I spoke with MOHELA representative with a Session ID XXXX Employee ID : XXXX. I had not gotten any communications from MOHELA since the call in XXXX, so I wanted to follow up. This representative told me my application had just been assigned today, coincidentally, to a XXXX XXXX and the status of my application was still showing as pending on her end. After consulting with a supervisor several times, this representative told me my application will be processed within 2-3 business days. She read the script that stated she would approve an administrative forbearance while this was being updated until XX/XX/XXXX. She did not indicate I needed to make any changes to my current application. She informed me of the loan information at that time. 
At approximately XXXX, I logged into my MOHELA account and my application status was 'canceled. ' At XXXX, I spoke with MOHELA representative XXXX and inquired why my application was showing as canceled and informed her of the plans that were established earlier in the day. XXXX consulted with a supervisor over the course of an hour, and told me I needed to re-submit a new application, without any reasonable explanation given the plans that were made earlier. XXXX stated she read my conversation with the representative earlier, and sees that the plan was established to place me in forbearance, but she can no longer do that since my application was canceled. In a matter of hours, I went from having an active application that was being assigned to a XXXX XXXX and was assured to be processed within 2-3 business days with a forbearance to assist during the interim to avoid delinquent status to being completely canceled. I was not given any notice of this from MOHELA and only discovered it by randomly logging into my MOHELA account. Based on my conversation today, I was told I would be in forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX with a processing application to be completed within 3 days. Had I not had the intuition to check this, my account would have been sitting delinquent, and my application was canceled without me being made aware of this. My new payment was already calculated and had been processing for months. I am able to pay the new payment. I am failing to see why I should have to re-start this process all over again. I am very concerned with the lack of accountability from MOHELA. There will be records indicating what was told to me and I do have an audio recording that verifies the representative observed the forbearance arrangement that was made. It is unreasonable for them to cancel my application the same day I made these arrangements. Especially without notifying me. This could have had very negative consequences on my financial situation and my public service loan forgiveness plans. I am ready and able to pay the already calculated payment of {$100.00} but they've made it impossible to do so. I don't feel I should be punished because they've failed to process my application in a reasonable time frame.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","WI","54701","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-27,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8644488,2024
2024-03-25,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","MOHELA - I am enrolled in PSLF and IDR with repayments beginning XX/XX/XXXX. Despite having created my account and enrolling in auto debit in XX/XX/XXXX they messed that up and I had to manually pay on XX/XX/XXXX which I did in the full amount owed, XXXX. Auto-debit began from my bank account to MOHELA XX/XX/XXXX and continued to pay on the exact XXXX date of every month : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email and letter from MOHELA stating that I missed my XX/XX/XXXX payment. My bank statement said I paid and the account online stated I paid but claims the payment posted on XX/XX/XXXX. When I called MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to XXXX who apologized for the errors and stated that my account had posted payment on XX/XX/XXXX. I also received an email letter from MOHELA stating that they received my payment on XX/XX/XXXX. I have never once missed a payment on IDR and PSLF since enrolling XX/XX/XXXX through all now 4 different servicers. ONLY MOHELA is problematic. In addition to claiming I did not pay, they added a late fee of {$67.00}. I was informed by XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX that this would be rectified and removed by end of business on XXXX. It was not. In fact, on XX/XX/XXXX my online account showed that I owed {$1200.00}. I called to inquire and s/w XXXX who was very incompetent and gaslit me telling me i never paid in XXXX and I owed {$1200.00} as my regular payment. I am in IDR and auto debit for XXXX. She then confirmed I was correct and repeatedly put me on hold to talk to her supervisors and team lead but was adamant to me that I was not allowed to s/w them as they arent allowed to come on the phone. Then it was confirmed to me that I did make my XXXX payment on the XX/XX/XXXX date in full and it was auto debit. Then I was told I still owed the {$1200.00}. Then I was told that the reason my payment was so high was because I paid too much at once. I was confused by this. She then told and and I saw on my online account that all my monthly payments from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX were paid on XX/XX/XXXX. This is fraud. I have bank statements to prove this and on XX/XX/XXXX my account did not show that but showed the actual dates I paid. I sadly do not have a screenshot of that but should have taken one I knew it. They refuse to fix my account. Calling them is always 1-3 hours on hold and then another hour on the phone to not resolve anything. I was told a supervisor would call back the next day. AT XXXX I received a call from an automated machine telling me that I missed a call. How?! I answered it. So they had XXXX intent to follow up and the automated machine told me i missed the call I answered and then also I had to call back the main XXXX number which is another 3 hours on hold to not even speak to someone who can help me. We go round and round for weeks with the same nonsense and nothing gets resolved. Additionally, my IDR plan was scheduled to change for payments on XX/XX/XXXX coming up - I had applied when mine was due- the reapplication in XX/XX/XXXX. MOHELA did not touch it yet my other loan company did in XXXX. I was told this would be expedited. As of XX/XX/XXXX I was informed my IDR was denied and also cancelled. My account shows both and no reasoning as to why this happened. No one could answer this for me when I called and wasted another 3 hours of my life on hold. Federal student aid states all IDR was put on hold b/c MOHELA needed to catch up. Well my account in one section states my IDR is still XXXX and not scheduled to renew until XX/XX/XXXX. However, my account now also says I was denied XXXX and that my XX/XX/XXXX payment is XXXX and ALSO that i owe {$1200.00}. I do not owe this. I can not pay this. I have never missed payments for XXXX. This is absurd and no one at MOHELA will fix this or take care of it at all. I have to work and can't call daily. Every time you call it's extreme absurd hold times and everyone gives a different answer ; it's bordering weaponized incompetence. I can't have this amount of money taken every month, that is a whole paycheck and then I can't pay rent or eat. They refuse to work with me and my income and family size has not changed since pre-covid so how they are denying and also fraudulently messing my account up is beyond me! They seem to clearly be trying to reap as much repayment as possible since i'm almost done with PSLF and trying to boot me out of it on purpose so that I am trapped. This is completely absurd. I also went to a predatory lending school and am already in a nightmare on top of this nightmare.

The next representative claimed the charge was related to the transfer and initially suggested I reapplied the payment ; then she stated the accounting department reapplied it. When I questioned the logic behind this and the fact that it made me appear delinquent, she explained it was an interest charge, as loans accrue interest daily. However, this explanation didn't add up. Why was I being charged {$19.00} randomly? This seemed like an error on their end.

I have not missed a payment. I am currently unemployed. I applied for IDR and PSLF after visiting FSA and seeing that I qualified for both. To apply for the PSLF I was required to apply for consolidation to insure accredited payments are applied evenly. I think XX/XX/XXXX was the date I applied. I received letters in the mail stating I was placed in forbearance pending determination for both programs. For IDR, I selected the SAVE plan because it had the lowest monthly rate and taxable payoff amount. On my loan servicer page, XXXX XXXX it stated my IDR would be serviced there. On the FSA site, it stated my automatically approved applications for PSLF needed to be forwarded to XXXX. I FAX the applications and my financial information to XXXX. I was warned that interest would be added to the loan if it wasnt paid during forbearance, but I couldnt reach anyone. FSA referred me to my servicer. XXXX was transferring accounts to its new name XXXX and XXXX did not have me in their system. Meanwhile, no one is taking live calls. I finally get a letter from XXXX stating I had a new loan, which was not for the monthly amount FSA said I qualified for under XXXX. XXXX shows I am not qualified for IDR or PSLF, but FSA still has my applications pending review. I finally get XXXX on the phone, I learn that they received my IDR and PSLF which are pending review, BUT my 19 yrs of payments, XXXX of them are gone! They reset my loan, added another XXXX to my payoff and set a payoff date in XXXX! My original payoff date was XXXX! My initial loan was just XXXX at graduation, ballooned to XXXX during my 3 month grace period and had an estimated final payoff of over XXXX, which as you can see I was close to paying off. Nowhere in this process did I read anything that stated that I would lose credit for all the years I have been paying by applying for these programs. The association for XXXX who was new, but very helpful stated that the XXXX payments they assigned me would be adjusted, but unless I qualified for immediate forgiveness, doing this hurt me rather than helped.

I also remember reading that I would have an opportunity to decided if I wanted to utilize the program or stay with the payments I was making. Im furious and disappointed.

I began working for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX which was the beginning of my public service that I have maintained. 

I qualified for the loan forgiveness and my XXXX accounts were transferred to XXXX in XXXX of XXXX. 

When the student loan forgiveness was blocked I re-engaged on my loan repayment and applied for an Income Driven Repayment Plan and received confirmation from adivantage that my monthly payment amount was {$0.00} beginning XX/XX/XXXX. 

My XXXX loans were transferred to Mohela. I created my account with Mohela on their website after receiving emails in XX/XX/XXXX that I missed a payment. 

When I logged into the account I saw they were attempting to collect payments. I called customer service and asked how they are doing so when I have confirmation of my repayment being {$0.00} a month. I was informed by a Mohela agent that I didn't provide income information that they requested, but I had no record of them making requests. 

I provided the date and information on my REPAYE plan, and uploaded the document to Mohela 's site on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Mohela then changed their online platform to another version. 

No one at Mohela has reviewed the confirmation or reached out. I contacted Mohela two additional times today, XX/XX/XXXX. I was told my confirmation letter was located, and that I should not be reporting in a deliquency status. I was told it required escalation and another representative to correct. They would not schedule a call back time for me, but assured me I could call back to follow. 

I called back later on and the representative had trouble understanding the follow up I was seeking, could not see my confirmation letter, and transferred me to a representative that could. That representative then said she was transferring me to a supervisor who could complete my request. The call was then transferred to an automatic call back request line, and no call back has been received yet.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","UT","84041","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-06,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8474740,2024

XXXX 's website states that any recertification date prior to XX/XX/XXXX ( https : //studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19 # income-driven-repayment ) will be delayed by a year, therefore, I did not recertify. Mohela is stating that my actual """" hard '' recertification date is XX/XX/XXXX. Yet I have no documentation of this date in any of my files. There are no other dates listed for recertification. On XXXX 's website, My IDR anniversary date is listed as XX/XX/XXXX. Clearly there is no indication that I have a recertification date prior to XX/XX/XXXX. 

I called them on XX/XX/XXXX and the initial agent I spoke with agreed with me. But when he went to talk w/ his supervisor they determined there was a """" soft '' and """" hard '' recertification date ( this is after XXXX hours of waiting on the phone ). The supervisor called me back the next day and still could not explain where in my file this XX/XX/XXXX date is. She just said she knew that was the date. 

I believe that Mohela has arbitrarily determined these dates in an effort to further confuse consumers and force early recertifications to increase their payments which clearly violate the intent of the Department of Education to provide appropriate time for consumers to recertify. In addition, their inability to provide documentation to lenders must violate lending statutes. They are also clearly inept at communicating within their own department regarding these new rules and are not communicating appropriately with the Department of Education on how to manage the regulations that have been put in place. 

In what world can the Federal Government so clearly make a regulation and have an agency refuse comply? 

My understanding is that this is a larger problem and effecting many thousands of individuals. Mohela 's customer service is taking several hours to even answer and then even more hours to get any sort of resolution due to poorly trained staff.

2024-02-22,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","Repayment of my federal student loans was initially begun with XXXX. I chose the Extended Repayment Plan and was faithfully paying {$210.00} per month before the pandemic payment pauses. 
During the pause period, my loans were transferred to MOHELA. When payments were due to resume in XXXX, XXXX, MOHELA advised me that my monthly payment was {$360.00}! This change to some sort of other payment plan was done entirely without my assent or knowledge, and I believe it was illegal for MOHELA to do this. 
I called several times in XXXX, suffering hold times of more than 2 to 3 hours. Each time I spoke with a representative, they could not tell me why my payment had been changed, or even what plan I had been put on. They said they understood I wanted to be put back on Extended Repayment, back to $ XXXX, and said they would pass that on. On one call, I was told that the supervisor just said it was not possible to change my plan! I called again and asked to speak with a supervisor. This person understood my problem, and said they would place me on administrative forbearance while they worked it out. 
At the end of the administrative forbearance, nothing changed! I was sent a statement showing that my XXXX, XXXX payment was to be {$360.00}. I tried to pay the {$210.00} that I believe I owed, but was unable to do this, because the website required me to acknowledge that if I made such a payment, I was paying less than I owed, which is not true. 
At this point, I gave up with telephone calls and sent several messages to MOHELA. One letter said they were going to request a forbearance while my situation could be looked at to change the payment plan. Then I recently received a letter that appeared to say two contradictory things- it stated that I was going to be in forbearance, but then, at the very very bottom of the letter after the grid with my loans, it states that my forbearance was denied due to """" overlaps ''??? 
Now I have been sent a statement that I owe three payments of {$360.00}, for a total of {$1000.00}. None of this is correct, and I worry that it will be impossible to correct soon, as MOHELA is in the process of changing to a new servicing platform. Please help!!!

I thought this was monthly. I had planned to use my property tax refunds I receive in XXXX to pay some principal on my student loans. However, according to Mohela I will have to pay the accrued interest bucket first before anything is applied to principal.

2024-01-12,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","MOHELA became my loan servicer during the COVID payment pause. I would call and no one would pick up. Eventually payments resumed for XX/XX/XXXX. Since MOHELA didn't send my statement in time, I was placed on admin forebearance until XX/XX/XXXX. I applied for SAVE/REPAYE on XX/XX/XXXX, and spoke to a phone represetative for MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX. The phone representative told me it would take 30 days to process. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I had a payment due. My SAVE/REPAYE had not processed. I attempted several times to call MOHELA but the hold times were over 30 minutes and I was not able to get someone on the phone. I had been sending several emails a month through MOHELA 's website portal, but every email had an automated response that either said """" You spoke to someone on the phone, we will consider your inquiry handled '' or it would say """" Please allow 15 business days for us to respond ''. These automated responses would come weeks after the initial email, and then no one would ever respond. I finally got another representative on the phone on XX/XX/XXXX after being on hold for 10 minutes, who told me she couldn't help me and I needed to speak to the """" Advanced Team ''. I was transferred to the """" Advanced Team '' representative XXXX XXXX employee XXXX. We discussed the following : XXXX XXXX XXXX MOHELA Advanced Team Submitted a letter asking to remove me from deferment on the MOHELA website, so that I have to specifically request a deferment in order for it to process. Confirmed receipt and was told by MOHELA phone rep that this means they will never put my loans in deferment unless I request via phone or email to put my loans in deferment. I had already submitted this request previously, but the MOHELA phone rep told me that she couldn't find this request and some, but not all of my loans showed in deferment. 

She issues a request to expedite my SAVE/REPAYE application. She advises it would take up to 15 business days to process from XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. 

She issues a request to put my loans in processing forebearance. Reports takes about a week to process. She initially states no interest will accrue during this time, but later when she reads the disclosure she states interest WILL accrue. I confirm that interest WILL accrue. She states it will postone payment until XX/XX/XXXX. She states there will be no interest rate reduction on autodebit, and no PSLF or benefits for loan forgiveness will be issued during this time it's in processing forebearance. I was told I could use buyback on processing forbearance once my SAVE/REPAYE processes, and there is no limit for how many months I could buy back. I asked why my forebearance is until XX/XX/XXXX if it takes 15 days to process. She said that's if it takes longer than 15 days to process. 


She sends request sent to accounting department to have my interest and capitalization removed and not applied to my account until the SAVE is approved. 


She sends request sent to the IDR department to have my loans amounts put back to XX/XX/XXXX where no interest, capitlization, fees, or other charges, and that amount will be used when SAVE repay processes. She states she doubts they will do this, and initially refuses to send request. I explain that I have no way of communicating with the IDR or accounting department except through her, and given all the issues I have had with MOHELA up to this point, I think this is fair for them to do. Currently interest and capitization are applied to my account, and I explain to her my understanding is that every month I am in forebearance, th e {$1600.00} payment MOHELA says I owe each month is going to get tacked on the end of my loan as principle, and will be used to calculate interest. So every month my loans are growing by {$1600.00}, plus the 5-7 % interest on top of that. So if MOHELA takes 6 or 8 months to process my SAVE/REPAYE, my loans will have grown by tens of thousands of dollars for no other reason than MOHELA can't process a form. That is not fair to me. She has no response to that other than to try to wrap up the call. 

At present I am waiting for MOHELA to process my requests, and I am not hopeful this will occur in any timely fashion. They have had 90+ days to process my SAVE/REPAYE, and my loans have grown by several thousand dollars in that time from what I understand from documents on my account on the MOHELA website.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","ME","039XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-12,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8153094,2024

2024-01-04,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","I AM A MILITARY MEMBER AND UNDER PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS I am writing to file a formal complaint against my student loan servicer, MOHELA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), due to ongoing issues and mismanagement of my student loan account. As a borrower, I have faced significant challenges and setbacks due to their handling of my account, which I believe violates my rights under the terms of my loan agreement and potentially under federal student loan laws. 

Account Mismanagement Details : I have no idea if I am in an administrative forbearance as that has not been communicated. Also, I have applied multiple times for XXXX  plan with no confirmations. 

Attempts to Resolve the Issue : I have tried calling and can not get through. No one can get through. 

Impact on You : I am under great stress because I have no idea what is going on with my loans. 

Violation of Rights : Possible violations : Right to Accurate Account Information : Borrowers have the right to receive accurate and timely information about their loan balance, interest rates, payment history, and any fees charged. If MOHELA provides incorrect or misleading information, or fails to update your account properly, this could be a violation. 

Right to Fair Treatment : This includes the right to be treated fairly regardless of race, gender, religion, national origin, age, disability status, or income. Any form of discrimination in servicing loans is a violation. 

Right to Prompt and Efficient Customer Service : Borrowers have the right to receive prompt and efficient service when they contact their loan servicer. If MOHELA consistently fails to respond to your inquiries or provides inadequate service, this could be considered a violation. 

Right to Proper Application of Payments : Payments should be applied to your account correctly, first to late fees and charges, then to interest, and finally to the principal. If MOHELA is applying payments incorrectly, this is a violation. 

Right to Error Resolution : If you believe there is an error on your account, you have the right to request that the servicer correct it. This includes misapplied payments, incorrect interest calculations, or erroneous charges. The servicer is obligated to respond to your concerns and correct any errors in a timely manner. 

Right to Information about Repayment Plans and Loan Forgiveness Programs : Borrowers are entitled to comprehensive information about different repayment options and loan forgiveness programs. If MOHELA fails to provide this information or misinforms you about your eligibility for such programs, this could be a violation. 

Right to Protection from Automatic Default : In the case of co-signed loans, some loan agreements state that the loan can be placed in default if the co-signer declares bankruptcy or dies. Newer regulations provide some protection against automatic default in these situations, and if MOHELA places your loan in default under these circumstances, it could be a violation. 
Right to a Detailed Monthly Statement : Borrowers are entitled to receive detailed monthly statements that include information on how payments were applied, the remaining balance, the interest rate, and any fees incurred.

Right to Informed Consent for Payment Allocation : If you have multiple loans managed by MOHELA, you have the right to specify how extra payments are allocated across these loans. If MOHELA reallocates payments without your consent, this might be a violation. 

Resolution Sought : I want my account handled correctly. I want to know that interest is being cleared off my account and I want a counter showing how much longer I have until my loans are forgiven under XXXX. I also want my XXXX plan application to be processed in a timely manner. It has not been done. 

I trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will take my complaint seriously and assist in resolving these issues with MOHELA. The mismanagement of my student loan has had a significant impact on my financial health and well-being, and I seek your intervention to ensure fair and legal treatment as per the regulatory standards governing student loan servicers.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","TX","77523","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8106657,2024

This XXXX was for payments XXXX and XXXX to then qualify my loans for forgiveness under the PSLF Program. I have a letter dated XX/XX/24 that indicated my XXXX was processed and that I had obtained 120 qualifying payments. However, a week later, my account was placed on a retroactive short-term forbearance that I did not ask for, because they didn't send out a billing statement in a timely manner back when my first payment was due in XXXX. This cascaded into my 120th payment being moved from qualifying to ineligible. So now I only have 119 qualifying payments, a second letter was sent, dated XXXX. I called Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX to ask what was going on. The customer service representative told me that they would be getting someone to fix the account. I called again on XXXX and this representative told me that the only way this was getting fixed was through the IDR waiver and there was no way for them to tell me when that might happen. Because my account had already reached 120 qualifying payments once, I am concerned that the IDR waiver will not be triggered. I am also concerned about this retroactive change to my account. They should not be able to go back and change an eligible payment to ineligible because of their mishandling of accounts.

MOHELA has never provided a response to my applications for forgiveness or acknowledgement of its efficacy, and demanded that payment restart on all loans in XXXX and again in XXXX. 
XXXX. Payments incorrectly requested from the borrower, and subsequently made during XXXX due to fear of credit repercussions, have not been refunded or applied to payments required/ restarted incorrectly in XXXX. 
XXXX. Payments made with the Segal Education Award in XXXX have been marked as received and then accepted by the institution ( MOHELA ) but do not show under payment history on the account, and the account has remained in an incorrect past due status despite repeated messages to customer service via message/in writing correct the status after each payment has been made. 
XXXX. After each payment was made in a timely manner with the Segal Education award, I sent a direct message to the institution ( MOHELA ) with the information about the payment made ( date, amount, account number, directions for application ) and the acceptance date from the institution, as well as documented receipt of payment and acceptance. Each message asks why said payment was not yet posted to the account though it was documented as received by MOHELA. MOHELA has responded each time and stated that they had not received the payment, even when provided with documentation showing that they had, including that the date of acceptance proceeded the payment due date, making the payment timely in both its submission and acceptance. MOHELA has continued to leave the account in past due status for nearly 90 days, with no payments applied, even though payments were and are being made in a timely manner and accepted by the institution before the payment due date each month. This has occurred in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and for the pre-payment made for XX/XX/XXXX. While XX/XX/XXXX was paid directly via bank account, MOHELA has incorrectly claimed that this was an application of the education award, though the payment history shows otherwise. 
XXXX. At this point, I am concerned MOHELA will attempt to damage my personal credit claiming payments have never been made, though documentation of payments made, dates of receipt and regular messages have been submitted to correct this issue. Customer service has continued to provide incorrect information or no information, and has no information available on their website indicating the proper process or timelines for submitting repayment using the Segal Education award via XXXX ( XXXX ). Customer service has also submitted incorrect information in response to my inquiries, claiming payments were applied from the education award when they never have shown as applied on the account or as part of the payment history.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","NV","897XX","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-26,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8618471,2024

I applied for the IDR program in XX/XX/2023, and Mohela failed to process my paperwork promptly. Despite multiple calls, I was told my paperwork was still being processed. I had to call at least five times to place a forbearance on my loan while waiting for the paperwork. The first bill I received from Mohela in XXXX was just one week before the payment due date. Mohela only allowed me to place a forbearance for one month and continued billing me. I had to keep calling to extend the forbearance while the IDR was being processed. In XXXX, I was informed that the IDR was not sent to the correct department and had to be resubmitted. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX, it still stated that my IDR was being processed. Once again, I had to call Mohela to inquire and ask to put my loan on forbearance, as I received a bill with a XXXX due date. The representative couldn't help, and I was transferred to a supervisor who was supposed to call me back within 24 hours. The call didn't happen as promised. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, a supervisor called me back, and after a 30-minute conversation, blamed the XXXX Department of Education for not forwarding my income verification. This contradicted my submission of all required information in XX/XX/2023. I was then asked to certify my income over the phone and have the IDR resubmitted for the third time. 

Mohela 's handling of applications and customer service is subpar, exhibiting disorganization, long hold times, delayed form processing, and errors necessitating multiple calls for forbearance due to their mistakes. Not to mention all the issues on them processing the student loan forgiveness applications in a timely manner. Please address this issue promptly.

I did not request this and MOHELA didn't tell me they were putting this on. I had already been approved for the SAVE program with a {$0.00} payment prior to all of this. I called MOHELA in XXXX asking them why there was a forbearance on my account and interest accumulating if I was approved for the SAVE program. I spoke to 2 different representatives that had no idea what I was talking about. Mind you I had to wait 2-3 hours before speaking to someone. I finally asked to speak with a supervisor who was able to submit a request for me to retroactively remove the alignment forbearance and remove any associated interest. I asked her how long would this take to process and she told me about a week. Fast forward to today nothing has been completed. I called them on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Each time I was given a different answer by reps and supervisors. When I called on XXXX  the rep XXXX told me my request was open and no one has even started working on it yet.

Per the Dept. of Ed. policy and a mass email directly from MOHELA, my account was placed into administrative forbearance until the end of XX/XX/XXXX while the issues were resolved. 

Before even realizing that there was an issue, I diligently made the first """" restart '' payment on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$680.00}. However, the administrative forbearance went into effect, and the stated policy was to either refund payments made during the forbearance or to apply them to future balances if no refund were requested. I chose the default option -- expecting my 'overpayment ' to be applied to my XXXX balance of the same amount. Instead, I received a bill for XXXX in the amount of {$680.00}. 

I reached out to MOHELA twice through their secure messaging portal with details of this oversight. My first communication was on XX/XX/XXXX. After not receiving even a confirmation of receipt, I repeated the secure message on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I finally received a response to the first copy of the communication yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX. I am repeating the beginning of MOHELA 's response below : """" Thank you for contacting MOHELA, We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Prior to repayment beginning on XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a request for the SAVE Plan and requested to be taken out of in-school deferment. The reason for this request is that, due to my low income, under SAVE my monthly payments would be {$0.00} and my interest would not accrue because of the {$0.00} qualifying payments. 

Despite my timely application, MOHELA did not process my request until late XX/XX/XXXX. The message stated that my request to be taken out of deferment would take effect in XXXX. This means that I accrued hundreds of dollars in interest for XXXX that I otherwise should not have had to pay under SAVE. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I was immediately told that I was put back into in-school deferment. This means that, to date, I have never received the benefit of the SAVE plan AND I was told I had to resubmit the application for SAVE again and it would take 60+ days to process. This essentially means I'll have to repeat the same process again throughout my time in school and I will be charged exorbitant amounts of interest that I shouldn't have to pay, since I'm eligible for the SAVE plan. 

I have called numerous times and am always transferred to a supervisor. Once this happens, I either face several hour long wait times and nobody ever answers, or I get sent straight to voicemail. 

MOHELA refuses to waive my interest fees from XXXX despite the fact that I shouldn't owe them under SAVE. They also sent me a bill saying I owe $ XXXX now, but my payment should be {$0.00}. I get transferred and can never get anyone on the phone to help me adjust my monthly payment, and they even said when they tried to adjust it, the system says I am not eligible for SAVE.

Every agent tells me something different, I am accruing thousands of dollars in debt due to their negligence, and nobody will assist me. I have been trying since XXXX.

I have questions about my loans. I think they miscalculated my progress toward PSLF loan repayment, but I can not get through to anyone to talk about this. I think I am at 117 qualifying payments according to counting the payment tracker on the Mohela website. However, their website has me at 101 qualifying payments. We need to talk about this. 

Getting messages 1 month after I send a question is unacceptable. No one in their right mind would ever accept working with a company who routinely demonstrates such bad customer service.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","NY","10003","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-12,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8333720,2024

2024-02-14,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","Good evening, I have XXXX federal student loans with Edfinancial, a servicer of Federal Student Aid. I am seeking assistance through the CFPB to resolve concerns regarding the gross mismanagement of my student loan account by Edfinancial. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my student loan was paid in full using a family members checking account. We contacted Edfinancial via phone, confirmed the balance of the account as of XX/XX/XXXX, and a payment was made for the full amount of {$8100.00} via debit card. I received a confirmation email from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX confirming the transaction. Funds were withdrawn from the family members checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, a payment of {$22.00} was withdrawn from my bank account via autopay to Edfinancial. On or about this time, I contacted Edfinancial via phone with concerns about the payment made, as my account was paid in full on XX/XX/XXXX. A representative assured me that since the payment had occurred within the last XXXX business days, it may take time to reflect on the account. I was transferred to another representative who confirmed that the payment was reflected on their end, but again, my student loan account had not been updated. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, another payment of {$22.00} was automatically withdrawn from my bank account from Edfinancial via autopay. 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Edfinancial again via phone with concerns that payments were still being withdrawn from my account and my account did not reflect that my loan was paid in full on XX/XX/XXXX. I was advised to attach documentation to my account regarding the confirmation of the payment made on XX/XX/XXXX for {$8100.00}, or any documentation supporting my claims. I was also advised to turn off autopay, so payments would stop withdrawing from my account for a payment I did not owe. The representative confirmed the payment was reflected in their systems, however, my account balance was not updated. I asked for the concern to be escalated for handling, and was informed the concern was escalated and would be resolved in XXXX business days. It is noted that Edfinancial failed to contact me despite assurances that I would be contacted in XXXX business days. 

After the call, I added two documents to my Edfinancial account as instructed. This included the confirmation email I received from XXXX confirmation regarding the payment of {$8100.00} made on XX/XX/XXXX. This also included a bank statement confirming {$8100.00} was withdrawn from the family members checking account on XX/XX/XXXX by US DEPT OF EDUCATION XXXX XXXX. It is noted that in order to upload documents, Edfinancial requires borrowers to select from Edfinancials list of documents to upload and choose the most relevant category prior to submission. After reviewing all XXXX options, the closest category representing both the payment confirmation email and the bank statement was Cancelled Check, Money Order, or Bank Statement. Both documents were uploaded securely to Edfinancial on or about XX/XX/XXXX with this description. This serves as an example of another barrier Edfinancial has in place to complicate simple interactions with their borrowers. 

It has now been 76 days since my student loan accounts were paid in full, and Edfinancial has failed to properly report my account as paid in full as of XX/XX/XXXX. Additionally, I have not received reimbursement for both payments made on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX for a total of {$44.00}. Edfinancial is currently reporting my account as past due, and my account has accrued interest since XX/XX/XXXX when my account was paid in full. Edfinancial has also sent a false XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX statement for payments made in 2023, as they have failed to accurately report payments made on my account in 2023 in a timely manner. 

I am concerned that I have exhausted all reasonable options available to myself as a borrower to resolve my concerns through Edfinancial, and Edfinancial will continue to negatively impact my financial future due to their failure to report accurate and timely information. My interactions with Edfinancial to date have not garnered confidence that they will treat the payment made on XX/XX/XXXX for {$8100.00} to my student loan account with anything but reckless disregard. 

I can provide documentation to support all claims made in the narrative above. Thank you for reviewing my complaint.","","EdFinancial Services","MD","20878","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-14,"Untimely response","No","N/A",8335829,2024

If you call their number it is 4.3 minutes before you're given the option to speak to a person via their unskippable call menus. When you get there, there's consistently a 90+ min wait to speak to a person. They do not respond via online messages. This is the only option and their """" please call me back '' option doesn't give time frames that allow for calls after work hours. They also are unavailable on the weekends. This makes them effectively impossible to communicate with. I have taken 4 days off work to try to fix this issue. It is unresolved. 

In XX/XX/2023 after denying my application for the SAVE plan twice, they put me in administrative forbearance so they could review the 3rd application. This forbearance lasted until XX/XX/XXXX after which I would receive my first bill on the SAVE plan. On XX/XX/XXXX they sent me a bill for {$800.00} which was due on XX/XX/XXXX. I called several times to tell them that i dont have that money as they had told me I was in administrative forbearance until the XXXX and wouldn't owe a payment until 1 month after coming off that forbearance. I spoke to someone after more than 2 hours waiting on the phone. They agreed there had been an error but said they had no way of correcting it unless I was willing to request personal or hardship forbearance ( of which there is a limited and unreplenishable amount ) to take the payment away. I refused, saying this was there problem and I wouldn't use my own resources to fix it. They said they'd """" see what they can do '' to fix it. I called back 15 days later and they had no record of me calling before and went through the same conversation again. They refused to let me speak to a supervisor during this call. 

The next month I paid my first payment and they stated I was delinquent {$800.00} and assessed a fee. I told them I had called and that this was their error, and they said I was correct and they would fix the problem- the woman on the phone was very kind. The next month the same issue occurred and no changes had been made on the account. I called again and took the day off work to resolve this.

He said that their stuff usually defaults to the Level plans at times and that yes, I could possibly do a forbearance temporarily but that wouldnt count toward the payments either.

old me that I did not submit those forms and that I needed to contact ECSI directly when this was never the process. Also, the loan that I was attending during the time of deferment was serviced by ECSI. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and the rep told me that I needed to hang up to speak with another rep. because a supervisor wasn't available. I also asked this rep to walk me through the wesbite where I can find signed documents that shows policies, and they do not exist on their website even though they are my loan servicer. I was directed to contact my former school. He also informed me that I was supposed to contact ESCI directly, even though the XXXX XXXX clearly states that no information will be received from the student. But my school did it on my behalf. 

Phone Call XXXX : I spoke with another rep who gave me helpful information that if the school can prove that they submitted an in-school deferment on my behalf, they could get my loans out of default. Even though he believed that did not happen because it was not reflected in the system. 

I called my school, and they said they submitted it through the XXXX XXXX. 

Phone Call XXXX : I spoke to another person, and she was most helpful but was sharing contradictory information. She first said that she could not see that my former school submitted anything, but she checked the back office and said that they saw it. However, it couldn't have been applied because I was already under a bankruptcy deferment. I asked how would a student know that. She said it would be on the website and that I would have received a notification via email about it. I asked her to walk me through the website, and after about XXXX minutes, she said that information was ONLY available to the back office team. But ensured me that they did their part. I told her that was untrue. If my school submitted an in-school deferment, and when the bankruptcy deferment expired, then the school deferment could have been applied. She informed me that I should have reached out to ECSI and asked for one that was already submitted by the school.","","HEARTLAND PAYMENT SYSTEMS INC","PA","19132","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-10,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8139042,2024

2024-03-09,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","I am a student loan borrower and my loans are currently being serviced by MOHELA. Below is summary of some recent issues I have experienced while interacting with MOHELA regarding my student loans and my MOHELA account. My attempts to have these issues resolved through direct communication with MOHELA and/or via complaints filed with the Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) Office of the US Department of Education have been unsuccessful. 

1. My request to be placed on forbearance after making XXXX payments toward PSLF, while my last PSLF form is being processed by MOHELA, was denied by them. This is contrary to information available on the FSA website, which indicates that borrowers HAVE THE OPTION TO REQUEST FORBEARANCE after making XXXX payments. 

Specifically : I have made XXXX payments toward PSLF, and they are reflected as 'eligible """" payments on MOHELA XXXX website. My XXXX eligible payment was posted on my due date, XX/XX/XXXX. My employer completed my employment certification form on XX/XX/XXXX, and it was received by MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX. As of this morning, the form shows processed, yet, no updates have been made to my account ( i.e., my employment dates and number of qualifying payments have NOT been updated ), and at this point it is unclear if the form was marked as processed in error, or if my account is yet to be updated. The processing time of PSLF forms per MOHELAs website is up to 60 days. 

I called MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX to request that my account be placed in forbearance while they are processing my PSLF form, and spoke to a representative by the name of XXXX. She denied my request stating MOHELA does not grant forbearances until their system confirms that the payments are qualifying ( i.e., they are made in accordance with all PLSF program rules ), which requires that the processing of my PSLF form is completed and my account is updated. I requested to speak to a supervisor or someone else in the office, but that request was denied as well because XXXX believed she had already given me all the information anyone in the office could give me. Yet, during the call we touched on various issues pertaining to my account and the PSLF program, and none of the information she provided was correct. She did place me on hold for some time, reportedly to check with a supervisor, but came back on the line XXXX min later to notify me that her supervisor, XXXX XXXX XXXX had refused to accept my call. Additionally, XXXX was not able to provide me with a call reference number for our call as it reportedly generates AFTER the call is completed. She suggested I call back to ask for the reference number, even though she was well aware of the exceptionally long wait times to speak to a representative at MOHELA ( i.e., it took me XXXX tries, a XXXX min attempt, followed by a XXXX min attempt, and I finally got connected after I waited on hold for nearly an hour ). Needless to say, as a full-time employee in the public sector is it extremely challenging to find enough time during business hours Monday to Friday to be on hold waiting to be connected with a MOHELA representative or to spend unnecessarily long time on the phone with representatives who provide erroneous information. Lastly, XXXX also refused to send me the call reference number after our call via MOHELA 's messaging system, as they do not send personal messages. She did say that all calls are being recorded, so hopefully my call with her can be tracked down if need be. 

The denial of my request to place my account in forbearance while my PSLF forms is being processed by MOHELA is contrary to what the US Department of Education/FSA indicate on the FSA website . Here is an excerpt of the statement from the FSA website : Q : When I submit my form for loan forgiveness after making the required XXXX qualifying payments, how long will it take to process my form and forgive my remaining loan balance? 
You should continue to make payments while your PSLF form is being processed, BUT YOU HAVE THE OPTION TO REQUEST A FORBEARANCE IF YOU BELIEVE ( or our system determines ) YOU HAVE ALREADY MADE XXXX PAYMENTS. 

The denial is further unreasonable and problematic given MOHELAs processing time of PSLF forms has doubled over the last couple of months, and has gone from up to XXXX days to up to XXXX days. Being the borrower, I should not be burdened financially by being forced to make extra payments, because MOHELA is unable to process applications in a timely fashion. In fact, based on past experience, these time frames are gross underestimates of how long it truly takes MOHELA to process PSLF applications. My last application from XX/XX/XXXX took over XXXX months to be processed, even though at the time MOHELAs website reflected that it would take up to 30 days. Additionally, forms are often incorrectly marked as processed, and yet, no updates are made to the account, which as of this morning, appears to be the case with my current PSLF form. Forms are also often marked as duplicate, even though they contain new/updated information. Prior to the payment restart in XX/XX/XXXX, MOHELA representatives on the phone were able to expedite the corrections of such errors, but since XX/XX/XXXX, they are no longer willing to do so. In turn, in order to have a mistake like that corrected, a borrower is placed at the end of line, as though they just submitted their form for processing, even though they had been waiting a while when the error in processing occurred ; as a result, the waiting period to have the form processed correctly is unnecessarily prolonged/restarted.

The month of XX/XX/XXXX is incorrectly listed as ineligible toward PSLF : The month of XX/XX/XXXX is listed as ineligible toward PSLF in my MOHELA account, which is incorrect. Specifically, there was Administrative Forbearance on my account between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX while my application to change my IDR plan was being processed. Per the new XXXX Department of Education rules, starting XX/XX/XXXX, periods spent in Administrative or Mandatory Administrative Forbearance count toward PSLF, and therefore, the month of XX/XX/XXXX, should be corrected to reflect eligible in my MOHELA account. 
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 3. Late billing notices for XX/XX/XXXX : I am one of the XXXX XXXX student loan borrowers, who received a late billing notice for the month of XX/XX/XXXX. Specifically, my billing notice was posted in my account on XX/XX/XXXX, only XXXX days prior to my payment due date at the time ( i.e., the XXXX of each month ), even though the notice itself was dated days prior to being posted ( i.e., XX/XX/XXXX ). After discovering XXXX failure to meet its basic obligation to send timely billing notices to borrowers, XXXX Department of Education instructed MOHELA to make adjusts to ALL affected borrowers accounts by : 1 ) placing them in forbearance until the issue was correct, 2 ) resetting the accrued interest to XXXX, and 3 ) crediting the affected accounts toward PSLF for each month the accounts remained in forbearance. Despite the directive from the US Department of Education, no adjustments were ever made to my account. Ive spoken to MOHELA multiple times about this issue, and after much push back from MOHELA ( indicating my account was not affected ), in XXXX I was promised that the adjustments to my account would be implemented within a few weeks. Yet, as of today, XX/XX/XXXX, no changes have been made. The interest that accrued in XXXX was never reset to XXXX, and the month of XXXX, as indicated above, continues to show as ineligible toward XXXX. As previously indicated, my account was in administrative forbearance, but for a different reason ( i.e., while my application to change my IDR plan was being processed ). I did file a complaint with FSA regarding this very issue, and it was closed XXXX times by MOHELA without any communication with me as to why it was closed and what the findings of their investigation showed. Please note that complaints filed with FSA get forwarded to the loan servicer ( i.e., MOHELA in my case ) for processing and resolution, which is why it was MOHELA, and not FSA, closing the complaints.

While the first course of action directed by the US Department of Education ( i.e., placing the account in forbearance ) is irrelevant in my case, since the account was already in forbearance for a different reason, the other XXXX directives ( i.e., 2. Resetting the accrued interest, and 3. Crediting XXXX toward PSLF ) still need to be addressed. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I will be happy to provide any additional information that might be required.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","CA","92602","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-09,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8510876,2024

After they updated their system, not only did my account number change which caused issues in itself, but their new website lacks basic financial auditing capabilities allowing me to print a detailed payment summary to use for loan reimbursements and payment tracking.

Immediately below is a note that says payments before the migration can not be viewed online. 

When requesting said documentation, their processing times are extended well over a month ( 37 business days ), even for somewhat simple document retrieval that should be able to be done by the borrower on the website.

Complaint : Forgiveness of Loans defrauded By XXXX XXXX XXXX Account number : XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX made a public speech about student loans and XXXX student loans being cheated and defrauded from XX/XX/XXXX, to its closure in XX/XX/XXXX. Being that I attended from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, more or less being that XX/XX/XXXX is approximately when I graduated from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The reason I am suggesting the multiple listed agents associated with my account XXXX is that as a former XXXX student from XXXX to XXXX, I was affected by being defrauded as XXXX XXXX has stated numerous times in his speeches about XXXX XXXX XXXX as well as XXXX and other notable institutions as to higher learning defrauding students as to loans, XXXX XXXX no longer, promises of help in job placement that never happened and I will insert here and now, that places I applied never recognized XXXX XXXX XXXX as a formidable institution of higher learning and in others just laughed when I was able to work in my field of study. XXXX XXXX has all the information about XXXX XXXX XXXX and their fraud, lies, deception, and job placement. 
Every news article and outlet from the XXXX to the XXXX XXXX carried what XXXX XXXX stated and quoted here : Former students are not required to apply and will receive a letter from the Education Department informing them of the pending discharge. XXXX XXXXXXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Every news article states the same thing, Former students are not required to apply. So why did I have to apply and be misled as to applying for borrower defense this goes against what XXXX XXXX stated : Former students are not required to apply. 
Moreover, quoting again from the same article as just XXXX article : The evidence shows that for years, XXXX leaders intentionally misled students about the quality of their programs to profit off federal student loan programs, with no regard for the hardship this would cause, Education Secretary XXXX XXXX said on a call with reporters Tuesday. As well as XXXX XXXX 's statement again quoting We are pleased that the Department of Education heeded our recommendation to forgive the federal loans owed by defrauded students. 
Department of Education has approved {$1.00} XXXX in discharges for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  in the past year based on evidence of widespread misrepresentations by the school. So, if XXXX XXXX based his evidence on widespread misrepresentations by XXXX XXXX XXXX the question remains and is part of the picture as mentioned above as to dates I attended. A slew of these for-profit and other higher education schools such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX to name a few schools listed as an example from XXXX news article in XXXX news article listed as what has been reported. 
Still, others like articles on student loans being that XXXX student loans are that. 
students defrauded by the XXXX XXXX XXXX, and those articles all can be looked up and state the same thing over and over. 
The XXXX that XXXX XXXX XXXX is associated with XXXX  was stripped of its XXXX  as reported by a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, as well as XXXX XXXX XXXX, just to name a few, yet articles appeared throughout the country stating the same thing, however, why am I missing out? And if I am just XXXX person, I wonder how many more are out there, that have been misled, yet again not only by XXXX XXXX XXXX, but also XXXX XXXX  XXXX, and now the current Department of Education making out XXXX XXXX XXXX students are and will be forgiven as to XXXX XXXX statement in XX/XX/XXXX. 
In addition, as of this writing, I will state that only around {$55000.00} was discharged not the full {$90000.00} plus dollars that should have been forgiven as outlined by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. So many confusing statements over the months since that press release in XXXX of XXXX. Furthermore, I have no paperwork about XXXX XXXX XXXX since I destroyed them all after I found out I was defrauded, my diploma is a lie, the credentials a lie, as well as the XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
It has been suggested I fill out a forgiveness form and why should I when the XXXX XXXX stated we students at XXXX XXXX XXXX loans be forgiven? Has anyone seen that forgiveness form, I need an attorney for such that I can not afford or the paperwork for that matter. Speaking of paperwork, I have no documents whatsoever except what is on Aidvanatage 's XXXX servicer website as an account. After I found out we students were defrauded I shredded every document, diploma, and certificate about or remotely associated with XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
In addition, I have reached out to the Department of Education addressed to XXXX XXXX and staff, but nothing. I also reached out and complained to Aidvanatge over a year ago and I was at the time XXXX talking to a XXXX at Aidvantage, I believe that is her name at Aidvanatge which she had no idea. I also reached out to Federal Student Aid over the past year, with no clear concise as to why, how, what to expect, when, or even why, and all the particulars as to my loan, as far as why only {$45000.00} to XXXX dollars only forgiven and not the total amount of over {$90000.00} plus dollars that should have been forgiven and since XXXX XXXX own words are and quoting XX/XX/XXXX Former students are not required to apply.

I emailed MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX, requesting additional information and why my recertification date was not extended.

According to MOHELA, I had over {$48000.00} more in loans than what was displayed on my online account. Additionally, the customer service representative stated that my subsidized loan had XXXX qualifying payments and my unsubsidized loan had XXXX qualifying payments. 

I trusted the information provided by the MOHELA representative. Additionally, on XX/XX/XXXX, a MOHELA representative had explained that due to new policies enacted by President Biden, I may be given additional qualifying payments toward loan forgiveness. Therefore, on XX/XX/XXXX, when MOHELA told me that my qualifying payments exceeded the number of months Id been teaching, I believed them. 

However, on XX/XX/XXXX, I called MOHELA because my account still stated that I had XXXX qualifying payments toward loan forgiveness. 

I asked the customer service representative to confirm that I still had XXXX qualifying payments for my subsidized loan and XXXX qualifying payments for my unsubsidized loan. The customer service representative stated that those qualifying payment counts were not accurate. The customer service representative confirmed that according to MOHELAs call notes from XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that I have XXXX and XXXX qualifying payments. She did not know how it was previously determined that I had XXXX and XXXX qualifying payments. She filed a complaint with MOHELA on my behalf. As of XX/XX/XXXX, I have not heard back from MOHELA regarding the complaint. I have also not heard back from Federal Student Aid regarding the complaint I filed with them. Twice I have called MOHELA ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) to get in contact with a supervisor, and I was disconnected without a follow up conversation. 

I have XXXX additional concerns with MOHELA : I submitted a Direct Consolidation Loan Application requesting a SAVE Repayment Plan on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told that it could take XXXX days for the consolidation to be processed. As of XX/XX/XXXX, Federal Student Aid indicates that my application is still in review with MOHELA. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my loan balance at MOHELA displayed only {$15000.00}. However, my loan balance just days prior was {$100000.00}. Seemingly overnight, {$90000.00} was no longer reported on MOHELA, Federal Student Aid, or XXXX. When I called MOHELA, the automated system stated that my loans were through XXXX. When I looked on my XXXX online account, there was {$0.00} reported with that servicer. I never received an explanation or documentation regarding the temporary loss of {$90000.00}. 

To Summarize I have only filed for loan consolidation once, and that application is still in review. However, in the past year, I have gone from having XXXX federal loans to having XXXX, then XXXX, and now finally XXXX. Throughout the past year, my qualifying payments toward loan forgiveness have never been accurately counted on my payment tracker. At XXXX point, {$90000.00} was erased entirely from my federal loan accounts. And most concerning, on XX/XX/XXXX, nearly {$50000.00} was inaccurately added to my loan balance by MOHELA. I have dealt with long call times and untrustworthy call representatives.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","MI","48073","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-03,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8089689,2024

At no point since XXXX have I been able to make payments on my loans. 

On XX/XX/2023, more than six months after receiving notification of the loan forgiveness, I received a form letter from Mohela stating they reviewed my recent paperwork and determined I am XXXX payments short of forgiveness. ( Mind you, the last paperwork I submitted to them was in XX/XX/2023, which gave rise to the XX/XX/2023 loan forgiveness. ) The form letter makes no mention of any errors. It ignores that the last XXXX months ever happened. In the meantime, based on Mohela 's representation that my loans were forgiven and the Dept. of Education 's XXXX balance, I recently changed jobs and am no longer employed by a qualifying-employer. 

When calling Mohela, they simply say a mistake was made. My payments do not qualify for PSLF. It appears interest has accrued while my balance was XXXX and payments could not be made. When I asked for assistance challenging their determination, customer support staff and supervisors claim there is no such mechanism exists.

I finally received a letter in my Nelnet inbox stating that my application had been processed on XX/XX/XXXX and that my payments would begin on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. In XXXX, I emailed Nelnet, again, because my account now showed my status as """" IDR PROC ADMIN '' which I was unsure what this meant. Since I had never gotten a response to my previous emails, I also tried calling. I was finally able to get through to someone and was told that this status was due to the fact that I hadn't yet made a payment under the SAVE plan. I was also told it would change once my first payment was due and that my payments would now begin on XX/XX/XXXX. This was very frustrating, as it had already been months of waiting for my application to process and the payments were supposed to begin on XX/XX/XXXX. Now, I would be gaining yet another month of accrued interest that I would not have gained if I could have made my payment with the SAVE plan on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked for confirmation that the XX/XX/XXXX due date would not change and that I would finally be able to make a payment under the SAVE plan on XX/XX/XXXX. I also confirmed that everything on my account looked good and that I was all set to begin the SAVE plan payments on that date. I was told yes. A few days later, I received an email response about this issue as well. In this email I was told that my payments would start on XX/XX/XXXX, the same as what the person on the phone had told me. Today, I logged back into my account to get the payment set up for XX/XX/XXXX and now my account states that the due date is not until XX/XX/XXXX. I am extremely frustrated with Nelnet. I was never told about this due date changing, yet again, and am very confused why the date continues to get pushed back. Now, I will gain another month of interest on my loans. I now owe hundreds of dollars that I would not have owed if I could have made the payments when I was originally told on XX/XX/XXXX. I was able to contact them today and they said there was nothing they could do. They promised, again, that the date would not move and that I would make my payment on XX/XX/XXXX. I do not believe anything they say at this point. They have now told me this XXXX separate times and each time, the date has changed, leaving me with extra expenses. Nelnet has been extremely difficult to reach and talk to about this issue, taking hours of my time just to get an answer that doesn't even stay true. I want my account to be credited for the extra interest I have accrued due to these pushbacks. I was never contacted about any of these dates changing which is unacceptable.

The amount for the 2 forgiven loans ( {$18000.00} ) is still showing on my credit report because Mohela has not contacted the reporting agencies to confirm that those loans should be struck from my records. Being XXXX XXXX military and moving to a new base every 3 years, it will negatively effecting my ability to plan for and get approved for our next home loan. 

Additionally, I made additional qualifying payments toward the PSLF program while my application was in review. A Mohela representative ensured me that I would receive a refund check from the US Treasury for the amount of those additional payments that I made to my federal loans. I have not received it. 

Its been almost a year since my package was approved and processed, and these two simple administrative issues are still unresolved.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","CO","80817","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-16,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8362238,2024
2024-02-19,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I have submitted a repayment application request to switch to a Standard Repayment Plan as I no longer qualify for an IBR plan. I submitted an application XXXX XXXX my account had not been updated in XXXX so I called mid XXXX to see the status of my application- they notified me that there would be a fee to switch payment plans ( which doesn't make any sense and was not noted in the application ) ; they also notified me that I should see the changes in my payment plan should be reflected in my account by the end of the month. It is now a month later in XX/XX/2024 and I still have not seen any changes in my payment plan. I called to check on the status of my application and they said they don't have it on file?! How could that be? I am now worried that I will be penalized for being on an IBR that I do not qualify for- but can not seem to get accurate information from Nelnet on how best to proceed. 

In conjunction, I am on an auto-payment plan through the provider as they said there is interest benefits for doing so. This month XX/XX/2024, they did not take the money from my account and marked my payment as delinquent. Again I would like to ask, How could that be?! In theory, I shouldn't have to log into a system to check if I paid if the payment is auto-withdrawn.

2024-02-27,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Problem with customer service","I am writing to address a persistent issue related to my student loan account, which has yet to be satisfactorily resolved despite multiple attempts to seek clarification through your customer service channels. I have received conflicting information on a series of phone calls and require immediate resolution. 

MOHELA made a billing error that occurred in XXXX and XXXX of XXXX, where a promised refund was not credited to my account. This was exacerbated by the inconsistent and contradictory information provided by customer service representatives during various phone conversations, in which some told me a refund had been mailed ( it never was ) and others told me it would be applied to my account ( it never was ). I am requesting the two months ' credit be applied to my student loans account immediately. 

For clarity, I would like to note that the administrative forbearance applied to my account for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX is unrelated to the billing error in question. That forbearance was applied due to my application for the XXXXncome Drive Repayment Program, which is unrelated to the refund that was to be issued to me due to MOHELA 's error. 

In phone calls with customer service representatives in XXXX and XXXX of XXXX, I was provided with conflicting information regarding my XXXX payment status, a purported refund issuance, and the feasibility of applying a credit to my account. This lack of coherence in the information provided only adds to the frustration and confusion surrounding this matter. 

As per my understanding, I am entitled to a refund for the payments made in XXXX and XXXX of XXXX due to MOHELA 's billing error. I kindly request that this refund be promptly credited to my account and applied towards upcoming payments. Additionally, I request that these credited payments be considered as part of my Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) loan count, consistent with the two months of forbearance in XXXX and XXXX, as is required by the Department of Education. 

I kindly ask that MOHELA rectify the errors in my account promptly and provide me with a clear and accurate statement reflecting the corrected information. I appreciate your immediate attention to this matter and expect that these concerns will be addressed in a timely and efficient manner.

I was immediately approved, and told that my new payment amount would be {$0.00} ( being a parent and having a mortgage, this was the best news ever ). So, I knew it might take some time to process with my servicer, which was switched to MOHELA when my PSLF ( I work for the XXXX XXXX ) was approved in XXXX of XXXX, so I sucked it up and made the first payment of {$240.00} at the same time. There was even an option during the SAVE Plan signup to apply {$5.00} to avoid anything counting as a missed payment ( or something like that ), which I took advantage of. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, and I have needed to make that {$240.00} payment 5 times so far, as MOHELA has listed my IDR Document as """" Processing, '' with a received date of XX/XX/XXXX, the day after I was approved for the program by the FSA. MOHELA 's website still states they have a high call volume, consulting the internet has resulted in me learning that it's essentially pointless to call, and that the only way any action gets taken is by filing a CFPB claim. I acknowledge that MOHELA has a lot of stuff to sort out, but the fact that they've taken over 5 months and still haven't processed my claim ( which, as a reminder, is PSLF-eligible, meaning in a few more years they should be forgiven ), it really seems as though they are delaying the process of my claim in order to get as much of the limited amount of money I would have to pay out of me. I can't afford these payments, I haven't been able to afford them, and the credit card debt I'm prevented from paying off by making these payments ( which I HAVE to make, as a condition of PSLF ) is causing massive harm to my credit score and the amount of debt I have now.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","CT","06810","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-27,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8432033,2024

2024-02-22,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Struggling to repay your loan","Problem with your payment plan","I am officially requesting help in my dispute against Mohela. I have tried repeatedly to get help from Mohela in resolving my problems with their company, and the level of support I have been offered has been tepid at best and does not respond to the severe problems that Mohelas errors are causing me, or will cause me in the future. I should say at the outset that the so-called relief that Mohela has offered me is a temporary forebearance while they sort through the mess they have caused. Which I did avail myself of because I dont really have much choice. But a forebearance is an inadequate solution because I am also enrolled in the PSLF program and it is my understanding that those periods of time in which you are in forebearance do not count towards your number of qualifying payments (except during the COVID forebearance program). The customer service agent told me that I dont need to worry about that because they will count this time period for qualifying payments. But, then when she read me the legal paperwork it says explicitly that forebearance does NOT count as qualifying payments for purposes of loan forgiveness programs. So I dont think she was correct about that, and the ideal solution will be a resolution of my problem under one of the existing IDR payment plans that exist, that I qualify for, and that I have applied for.

So let me lay out my two problems in advance and then I will follow up with documentation and context in the space below.

Problem #1:  I was in the XXXX  program and Mohela took me out of it for some undisclosed reason (I suspect that I know the reason, which I will elaborate on shortly). There are two existing applications for an IDR plan for my direct loans, one of which dates back to XXXX XXXX XXXX - so 9 and a half weeks ago now! - but they just say that it is processing and will not give me a date when I should reasonably expect it to be approved. Meanwhile, they put me in a Level (standard) repayment plan and expect me to cough up nearly $1600 per month while they twiddle their thumbs.
Problem #2: In XXXX  of XXXX  (yes, you read that right, XXXX  of XXXX, so like almost 17 months ago) I applied for the PSLF program to get student loan forgiveness. This was because of a waiver that was in place until XXXX  XXXX. Mohela reviewed my application and said that I met the requirements, but when I ask them how many qualifying payments have been counted, they always tell me that they are waiting on the federal government to tell them how many qualifying payments I have. So I just keep waiting and an answer never comes. You can ask Mohela to call the federal government and request that information, but Mohela wont lift a finger to get me that information. They always say, we dont call them, they call us. I guess Mohela thinks that reasonable waiting times for processing ought to be defined in terms of YEARS rather than days.

The IDR Debacle

All of the problems with my payment plan (the PAYE program) began, I believe, last year. I had been plagued by a XXXX XXXX  during College. XXXX XXXX never told me when they gave me the loan that it was treated differently for repayment purposes than other student loans. They presented it like it was a really great thing. But it turns out that XXXX XXXX do not have the range of repayment options that XXXX XXXX do. So when I entered repayment, I found that this XXXX XXXX was a real thorn in my side. Everyone kept telling me that the only way to get an IDR plan for a XXXX XXXX was to consolidate it with one of the direct loans. But the problem with doing that is that it would reset the forgiveness for the PSLF program. Or so I thought. But last year, after speaking with the Department of Education, I was told that there was a waiver in place through XXXX  XXXX  that would allow the new consolidation loan to take on the same number of qualifying payments as the loan that the XXXX XXXX was being consolidated with. So I decided to risk it with one of my existing unsubsidized loans, leaving the others untouched. Because frankly I am never 100% sure of anything that I am told by someone over the phone. That consolidation was processed in mid XXXX, XXXX, and curiously enough, at that same time ALL of my loans were taken off of the PAYE plan and put on the horrible Level repayment plan. So I believe that this Perkins consolidation was the reason that they took me off the IDR plan.

The thing is, that consolidation should have effected, at most, one of my Direct loans. So I dont understand why the other nine or so loans, which were never rolled into the new consolidation loan, were taken off of the PAYE program. I believe this was Mohelas error. I asked them to just put those 9 (or maybe 10) loans back onto the plan they were on, but I was told that their system wouldnt let them do that. So if this is Mohelas error, shouldnt they correct it by putting those loans back on the plan they were on? When I filled out the consolidation loan, in the new IDR application I said to just put the new loan on the same plan as the other direct loans, so a lay reading of that would make one believe that the current IDR application (the one dated XXXX) is just for the new loan, and that it will be put on the same plan as the other loans once they get around to processing it. But, thats not a desirable request if the procedure is to remove all the other loans from their IDR plan, so that cant be what the federal government had in mind for these consolidations. I figure that the federal governments vision is either a) that the new consolidation loan be placed on the same IDR plan as the UNTOUCHED other direct loans, or else b) that the federal government intends that the new IDR application be an application for all of the direct loans BUT that they intend that that application be processed at the same time as the consolidation. But Mohelas process seems to be to process the consolidation loan and then wait months to process the IDR application THAT ACCOMPANIES THE CONSOLIDATION REQUEST! Either way, the months long wait for an IDR application is unreasonable, unfair, and subjects me to the possible injury of not having this time counted towards my PSLF qualifying payments. And I would request that Mohela be forced to make it right immediately, not on their laid back time schedule. Forebearance is not an equitable resolution for the reasons that I indicated earlier.

Please note, on XXXX XXXX XXXX I also applied for the SAVE program because I hoped that such an application would be expedited. Mohela has confirmed for me, though, in this evenings phone conversation that they have no intention of expediting this application even though they screwed up the other one apparently. And when you ask for an expected date, they say things like, well typically it takes up to fifteen days, but you have to understand that we have millions of applications so things might take longer nowadays.

The Difficulty in contacting Mohela

Then, too, it is almost impossible to contact Mohela about anything. So, for instance, on XXXX I messaged Mohela about my missing PSLF Qualifying payments. Did I get an answer back? Well, a week later (XXXX3) I got a form letter response back telling me that they were refusing to answer my question over email, but that I am welcome to call in. So messaging them doesnt get a response. On XXXX I messaged them about my missing PSLF qualifying payments AND my urgent problem of their screwup involving my IDR. No response yet. Maybe they prefer phone calls? You would think. But calling them is a nightmare. Today, I called them at XXXX XXXX  and had a one hour and 24 minute long phone call. The bulk of this was on hold. I was able to briefly speak to someone who told me that they were not able to help me because my problems require a senior representative. So it was back to the HOLD queue until I had to hang up around XXXX XXXX. because I had to teach an XXXX  class. I called again at XXXX XXXX. and had another hour and 30 minute phone call, the bulk of it - again - on hold. I briefly spoke to another person who told me that I needed a senior agent, and then back to the hold queue. I did finally speak to one of these senior agents, but they couldnt solve either problem for me and the only resolution they offered me was a forebearance while I go back to Mohelas waiting game. Mohela LOVES to make customers wait, even if waiting causes us inconvenience or possible financial harm. Mohelas excuse for their waiting game is always the same you have to understand that we have millions of applications to process. Sorry. Not good enough. We have a right to expect that we will get the service we need in reasonable time frames. And we also have a right to expect that Mohela will fix their own errors and not expect the customer to just eat the damage. So my point is twofold: One, I want to make the point that I HAVE tried to resolve these issues with Mohela. Its not like I am just jumping straight to asking for outside help. But Mohela makes it very difficult to work with them. And my second point is that this lack of accessibility is itself, I believe, an unfair business practice so I would ask for your help in requiring Mohela to be more accessible.

The PSLF Debacle

I would ask for your help in two respects regarding my PSLF application. First, Mohela wants to pass the buck to the federal government. But this evades taking responsibility for their own actions. Is Mohela the processor of the PSLF program or not? If they are, then they need to be held accountable for timely accounting of these qualifying payments. If they are not the processor of the PSLF program, then my account needs to be managed by whoever it is that is administering the PSLF program. The way it is now, they basically do nothing about your application and then blame the federal government. If the federal government truly is to blame, then Mohela needs to be like a bulldog demanding that the requested information be turned over in a timely fashion. Heck, they ought to file a Freedom of Information Act request on my behalf. But this just goes back to the second thing that I need help with. Mohela has an absurd view of what constitutes a reasonable wait. Like, I think that every sane person would think that not having an answer a year and a half after applying is completely unreasonable. But Mohela thinks that I am the one who is being unreasonable, and that I just ought to wait as long as it takes for them to sit on my application and absolutely never, ever, ask them to do anything. They say on their website that PSLF applications can take up to 90 days. Is it unreasonable to hold them to that? I feel like this waiting game that they like to do is a completely unfair business act. And I feel like their blaming the federal government or the department of education is just a nebulous bogeyman to distract from their own incompetence. 

Now, that having been said, to the extent that the federal government is also delaying, I would appreciate your help with getting a timely answer here from them as well.

So please consider this a formal complaint against Mohela and a formal request for help from your agency, whether that agency is Mohela or the federal government.

Specifically, I have worked in public service at a qualifying employer prior to the implementation of PSLF in XXXX until now. As such, I would have been eligible as of XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX was my loan servicer. As a loan servicer, it was difficult to get information about PSLF/repayment plans as well as their ever-changing criteria. I was always told I had the wrong loan type or repayment plan resulting in my payments not counting towards PSLF. The Cares Act suspended student loan payments and waived interest between XXXX and XXXX. However, I made consistent payments during this time. Additionally, I was able to qualify for loan forgiveness solely due to the temporary changes made to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) program between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. In XXXX, my loans were forgiven and I was determined eligible for PSLF as of XXXX. As I believed my eligibility date should have been XXXX, I sent verification of my qualifying employment during XXXX to XXXX and Department of Education as they both instructed for reconsideration of my PSLF eligibility date. As stated, Ive gotten emails from XXXX indicating that there was a refund of payments that supposedly came in a lump sum but they refused to provide additional information such as deposit details or verification. I have filed complaints about them with the Department of Education to no avail. Neither corrected my PSLF eligibility date NOR issued a refund for any and all payments made since XXXX. Immediately upon being notified of the forgiveness, I no longer had online access to view my payment history on XXXX website. I attempted to contact XXXX by phone and email spending countless hours on hold and back & forth emails with no resolution. I am due a refund for overpayments since XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX redirected me to the Department of Education, and vice versa. XXXX insisted they issued a refund but provided no other information and consistently redirected me to the Treasury Department. I am due a refund in excess of {$12000.00} plus interest. They should incur the same late fees and penalties we have to incur as borrowers in this student loan debt scheme. I am long overdue a refund for all overpayment/payments made since XXXX. Conveniently, XXXX discontinued their loan servicing while outstanding debts are owed and transferred accounts to Mohela. I have made several efforts to contact XXXX XXXX prior to their discontinuation of loan servicing. I was directed to Mohela although my loans were forgiven. I also received correspondence from Mohela THEREAFER stating that my PSLF is under review. I contacted Mohela by phone for additional information but was told there was no record of me/my accounts in their system. There continues to be a lack of communication and transparency. Neither the Department of Education, MOHELA, or XXXX has taken steps to get this matter resolved.

This action will help more than XXXX XXXX additional borrowers burdened by debt during the XXXX emergency. 
At a time when many student loan borrowers have faced economic uncertainty, were ensuring that relief already provided to borrowers of loans held by the Department is available to more borrowers who need the same help so they can focus on meeting their basic needs, said XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Our goal is to enable theseborrowers who are struggling in defaultto get the same protections previously made available to tens of millions of other borrowers to help weather the uncertainty of the pandemic. 
Under the XXXX XXXX, private lenders made federal student loans to students and guaranty agencies insured these funds, which were, in turn, reinsured by the federal government. After these loans enter default, they are transferred from the lender to the guaranty agency. While some FFEL Program loans are now held by the Department because they were purchased by the federal government during the financial crisis over a decade ago, many others remain with private entities. 
Today, the Department is announcing that it will expand the 0 % interest rate and pause of collections activity to XXXX XXXX borrowers who defaulted on a privately-held FFEL Program loan . This action will protect more than XXXX borrowers who were at risk of having their federal tax refunds seized to repay a defaulted loan. This relief will be made retroactive to XX/XX/XXXX, the start of the XXXX national emergency. 
The Department will work to automatically return any tax refunds seized or wages garnished over the past year. Borrowers who made voluntary payments on any of these loans during the past year will have the option to request a refund of those amounts. The Department will also work with the guaranty agencies, who hold these defaulted FFEL Program loans, to implement the 0 % interest rate for these borrowers. 
In addition, any of these loans that went into default since XX/XX/XXXX, will be returned to good standing. The guaranty agencies that hold those loans will assign them to the Department and request that the credit bureaus remove the record of default. 
This action builds upon steps already taken by the XXXX XXXX to help federal student loan borrowers. Those steps include pausing student loan interest, repayment, and collections activity for tens of millions of borrowers with loans held by the Department through XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The Department also requested a waiver from the XXXX XXXX XXXX so that individualsdespite currently or previously defaulting on federal student loans or previously being delinquent on paymentswill still be eligible for a Paycheck Protection Program loan and related loan forgiveness. The waiver immediately helped nearly XXXX small business owners.

I received an email yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, stating that my Mohela XXXX XXXX payment was due. I logged into my account because I was curious since my loans had been forgiven. When I logged into my account, I saw a loan balance of {$31000.00}. This was news to me. I immediately looked in the messages within my Mohela account to see if I had missed some sort of notification. There was nothing. Then I searched my email and there was nothing. Mohela reversed my loans without my knowledge. Today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I called Mohela. After being redirected with automated prompts for 20 minutes I finally got a human on the phone. Once I began speaking to the representative she said, it looks like your forgiveness has been reversed because you didn't have enough qualifying payments. She told me I now owe {$31.00}, XXXX. I was in shock. I just found out they were forgiven and received no warning or letter stating that this was even an issue. the representative then told me that she could no longer help me and that she would transfer me to a supervisor. Once she transferred me to a supervisor, I was promoted to confirm my callback number and then the call disconnected. 

I understand that the government is constantly making changes to forgiveness policies, but to present the information stating that a borrower qualifies and then award them the forgiveness just to retract it later, without even notifying the borrower is highly unprofessional and unethical. 
I have never dealt with this level of unprofessionalism from a company that represents the Federal Government. It is a disgrace.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","SC","29715","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-23,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8408721,2024

I had all my federal loans with MOHELA for years and was current on my XXXX. The company indicated on XX/XX/XXXX, that I made 120 qualifying payments and put my account in forbearance. There was no other clear communication. I called the company to clarify how long it would be for my debt to be discharged under the rules of PSLF, and a staff member indicated that it would be sometime in the coming months. Its now the end of XXXX, and all thats happened is my debt is still in forbearance, which was extended through XXXX. Neither MOHELA nor FSA are providing any information other than that my account needs 90 business days to be reviewed. FSA confirmed that they see I made 120 qualifying payments on qualifying loans and also indicated it would be 90 business days. This is not what PSLF states as far as program rules. Borrowers are told that their debt is forgiven after 120 qualifying payments. In my case, its been 4 months since my final PSLF payment ( and I made 3 more months of qualifying payments while waiting for initial processing ), and my application is still not processed. The question is who benefits from this behavior? It is not the borrower. 

My life is on hold until this debt is forgiven under the terms of the program, and I expect MOHELA continues to get paid by the Department of Education for managing my account even though my final payment should have been XX/XX/XXXX.

My problems with Mohela started in XXXX when payments were supposed to resume. I applied for the SAVE repayment plan in XX/XX/XXXX, and the US Dept of Education said I qualified for the SAVE plan for all my loans. Mohela placed me in an administrative forbearance for XXXX  months ( XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ) and continued to charge me interest. In fact, they charged me a higher interest rate than they should have. In XXXX, I applied for, and they approved, my auto debit application, but they did not apply the .25 % discount on the interest rate because my loans were still in administrative forbearance. When I called Mohela to ask about why I was still in forbearance, I waited for an hour to talk to a customer service representative, and she seemed helpful. She said she was sending my case to a specialist, and they would be in touch with me to figure out why my SAVE application and recalculation of my payment was still pending. I never heard from anyone. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, they managed to put me on the SAVE plan, for XXXX of my XXXX loans. That month, they auto-debited my payment for those XXXX loans, and finally the auto-debit discount kicked in. 

For the other XXXX loans, in XX/XX/XXXX, they put them on a standard repayment plan, even though, according to the US Dept of Education, I qualify for the SAVE plan. When I called Mohela to find out why these XXXX loans were not on the SAVE plan, I waited on hold for an hour.

She couldn't actually do anything, but is hired by this company to ask me every XXXX minutes whether I want to stay on hold to talk to a mythical someone who could actually help me. It's XXXX.

Most recently, I asked the US Dept of Education how and when the interest subsidy for the SAVE program will be applied. For the SAVE plan, any interest not covered by your monthly payment is supposed to be covered by the government. I have not received any subsidy. The US Dept of Education 's response?

2024-01-09,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I have been attempting to make a ~ {$22000.00} payment toward my student loan balances since XX/XX/XXXX with AidVantage. I first made the payment using my online account with my checking and routing number. This is the exact same checking and routing number associated with my account that AidVantage successfully pulls monthly autopayments from. I received a confirmation email with confirmation # XXXX for the amount of {$22000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I waited XXXX weeks to allow for processing time, but the funds were not pulled from my checking account and nothing was adjusted on my loan balance, so I called AidVantage. They said they did not know what happened to my large payment. They suggested I call my bank or wait longer for processing time due to high volume of payments. I called XXXX Bank, and they said they have no record of this payment at all on their end. They also assured me that they would have no issue processing this payment as the funds are sufficient and that the account and routing numbers are correct. They said I did not need special approval for this amount. They said this is an issue on AidVantage 's end. I called back to AidVantage after more time passed and the payment still had not processed. They could not tell me where the original payment went, but they suggested I make a new payment over the phone. I paid over the phone on XX/XX/XXXX. I received a confirmation email with confirmation # XXXX for the amount of {$22000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. They assured me that this method would be successful. I waited XXXX weeks to see this reflected on my account, and nothing ever changed. I called back again on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with a variety of people regarding my issues, called XXXX Bank again to verify that there was no issue on the bank 's end, and ultimately spoke with a supervisor. The supervisor, XXXX, processed a new payment over the phone for a total amount of {$22000.00}. I again received a confirmation email and confirmation # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. It is now XX/XX/XXXX, and I had to call AidVantage again because nothing has been processed. They said they will have to conduct an investigation to see what is happening to the missing payments. I will receive notification on XX/XX/XXXX regarding the status of the investigation, but they also suggested I mail in a check for {$22000.00} to resolve the issue. I do not feel comfortable mailing a check for that amount. The checking and routing numbers are successfully associated with my account, and they draft regular monthly autopayments from the exact same account. I do not understand why they will not process the ~ {$22000.00} amount to clear some of my loan balances. I am accruing interest every day on these loans, and it has been incredibly frustrating to receive no explanation or assistance with this from AidVantage.","","Maximus Education, LLC dba Aidvantage","GA","31322","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-09,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8130238,2024

For example, my tracker jumps from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX even though the approved employment listed with Mohela includes that full time, so that period alone is 35 payments missing. The tracker also only goes back to XXXX despite approved employment going all the way back to the beginning of PSLF in XXXX, so every payment from XXXX is missing. When I apply again to try to get it updated, they mark it as duplicate and say that employment certification form was already processed, but the missing payments never get added. I applied before the waiver expired in XX/XX/XXXX and they still haven't updated the payment count. I need ALL of the approved periods on my employment certification forms added to the payment counts.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","TX","75087","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-11,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8326540,2024

Their response alerted us to greater issues with our loans. In their reply to the CFPB they provided us an executive advocate. Fast forward we were never able to reach the advocate through various attempts and means emails, telephone, certified letters etc. The advocate was disingenuous. Discover misrepresented in their response to the CFPB disbursements they did not make, loans not sighed and rates provided to borrower not chosen. Discover withdrew from our bank acct without our authorization for each loan for withdrawal as one loan one payment per month. On discovers own election they combined all our loans into one loan, billed us for one loan and electronically withdraw one amount monthly from our accounts of that combined rate without our banking consent. Discover is charging us an interest percentage amount monthly that exceeds well over 100 % and well over federal and state limits of interest. They filed unfair bad credits reports upon us when we complained to their CEO directly in a punitive manner. Our loans are CURRENT. Discover has refused to respond to the total amount of interest they billed and collected from us. They increase our interest rate in gross margins multiple times a year WITHOUT NOTICE. They provide confusing explanations, formularys and on and on. If the internet rate was fair and just that they were collecting then they would answer with what the exact percentage of internet was that was collected. Instead they engage in a thug like conduct and refuse including advising us no further communication on this matter! It is outrageous! Not one time BUT for months and as of XX/XX/XXXX over a year.

2024-01-11,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Incorrect information on your report","Account information incorrect","I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information that has been reported on my credit report by Aidvantage - Federal Student Aid Loan Servicing. This concerns my student loan account accounts.

My credit report indicates that my student loan payments were on time for XXXX and XX/XX/2019. However, inexplicably, for XX/XX/2019, it is reported as being XXXX  days late. This progression is illogical and indicates a clear error, as it is impossible for an account to be current and then suddenly XXXX  days delinquent within a XXXX period. This inconsistency in reporting further substantiates the inaccuracy of the information provided by the servicer. 

Moreover, the report of a XXXX late payment in XX/XX/2019 is inaccurate as I was enrolled in XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time, making my loan eligible for deferment. Under the terms of my student loan and federal regulations governing student loans, my loan payments should have been deferred while I was enrolled in school.

This inaccurate reporting constitutes a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically : 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), which requires furnishers of information to credit reporting agencies to provide accurate information.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ), which outlines the responsibilities of the credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable investigation upon receiving a dispute from a consumer.

Despite my attempts to resolve this issue directly with Aidvantage, including providing proof of my enrollment in school, they have refused to correct this error. This ongoing inaccuracy is not only a violation of the FCRA but is also adversely affecting my credit score and, consequently, my financial well-being.","","Maximus Education, LLC dba Aidvantage","AL","350XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-11,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8150527,2024

2024-03-09,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","Mohela XXXX... 

I want to share my recent experience in case anyone else goes through the same. 

Last XXXX I received about {$8700.00} from my job as the third year of a signing commitment. This was supposed to be used as my monthly payments from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, before I had a chance to know the funds were released, or applied, or I could appeal, the entire sum was applied to my outstanding interest. I received my XXXX statement which said I was due to pay my monthly $ XXXX. 

I called to find out what happened to the {$8700.00}. After hours, I was told that money could never be used to pay ahead. At the time, this was in direct conflict with written statements on Studentloan.gov and the Mohela website. After more hours, I was passed to a customer service agent who confirmed I was right, and the money would be distributed as it should. 

Weeks later, nothing changed. More calls, more demands, and I even reached out to Student loan.Gov, the department of education, and more to demand their actual written understanding of the applicable guidance. Each one stated I had to refer back to my loan servicer. I asked what my recourse was when my loan servicer was literally make their own rules, and I received no aid. 

I filed a complaint with the XXXX  and my state attorney general. By this point, I had to pay the XXXX payment to avoid default. Ever since the first call to Mohela, I demanded a refund of my XXXX era payments, which I under current rules in XXXX, I was allowed to do until XXXX of XXXX. I also filed an internal complaint with Mohela. 

My account was placed in an """" unrelated administrative forbearance '' due to improper billing/invoice for XXXX to XXXX and my XXXX payment was nullified. Mohela responded to the State Attorney General to say that all refund requests must be made prior to XX/XX/XXXX, and Mohela sent an appeal to a different government agency asking for special permission to return the money. This XX/XX/XXXX date was not in place, to the best of all my understanding, in XXXX. Which is why I requested a refund then Their online rules have also changed in the Department of Ed and Mohela. Both now state that lump sum payments will only count ahead to the next recertification date. This was not in place prior to XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX came, and my $ XXXX from XXXX was moved to cover XXXX. The {$8700.00} was now missing from my Mohela account. I also received a letter requiring me to recertify my loans in an income driven repayment plan by XX/XX/XXXX. My recertification date is not due until XX/XX/XXXX. It is this point I am complaining for now. 

I called. Mohela again. More hours of wait time. I was told the date they sent was wrong, and I could even see on their own website XXXX dates listed, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, for my own due date. The phone rep said to ignore the XXXX date and recertify as normal. 

More letters. Threatening that if I didn't recertify in XXXX I would have a {$2900.00} payment due. I decided to recertify early, figuring it was better to give Mohela more time to get my paperwork right. 

Wrong. Despite submitting my IDR on XX/XX/XXXX, more than a month before it's due date, my payment amount required by the end of XXXX did not change. Another few calls, and hours waiting with Mohela. 

The verdict : I didn't recertify soon enough. Because of this, I did not meet the IDR deadline and though my paperwork was processed and accepted on XX/XX/XXXX, my IDR won't kick in until XXXX. ( I have never not been on an IDR. There is ZERO reason for me to be dropped for this time frame ). I have never been dropped from an IDR since my starting loan payments in XXXX. 

I was therefore obligated to pay the nearly {$3000.00} before the IDR began, or I could apply for forbearance and hope it is accepted. Again... I've done nothing wrong. I've played by the XXXX rules. Also, though I've been verbally told this type of forbearance period counts to my PSLF, the terms and conditions state the exact opposite. 

I request an appeal. With, if Mohela accepts to hear me, it will be another 10 business days before I know. In the mean time I have to apply for forbearance because that date will fall within 7 days of the bill being due, and the account won't get fixed in that time frame. If it's even attempted to be fixed. I am not allowed to continue my current payment plan. 

I've now received information about an administrative forbearance, which is not the kind discussed on the phone. And that {$8700.00}? Still in limbo, with no answers, or updates, since XXXX. Mohela states the appeal is with a different government agency, and they have no aid or information to provide. 

I'm just trying to do everything right. But now, I don't know what to do at all.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","MD","20850","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-09,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8510337,2024

I have been diligent in making sure employment verification forms were sent every year for the last XXXX years while I was teaching in XXXX XXXX. I have kept up to date on student loan legislation and applied for Biden 's relief ( which was originally overturned by the courts ) and TEPSLF. Part of that legislation allowed teachers, like myself, to file employment verification for years of teaching prior to loan repayment. I then submitted verification for my XXXX years of teaching prior to the last XXXX years. For the last XXXX years, I taught in the same school in XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX. The XXXX years prior to that, I taught in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX a small community in XXXX. Shortly after submitting that paperwork, I received notifications that TEPSLF applied and many of my loans were forgiven. About a month ago, I was notified that another loan was forgiven. Currently, I have several loans that are showing XXXX out of XXXX. One loan is at XXXX out of XXXX. The loans that weren't forgiven have been around for more than ten years, they weren't any different than any of the other loans forgiven, and no one is able to explain why they weren't forgiven when loans I took out before AND AFTER were forgiven. One rep I spoke with in XX/XX/XXXX said I didn't have employment verification between XXXX XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. I told her that I had submitted that employment verification, which is evident in the fact that several loans were forgiven with that employment timeline verified. Also, that time span covers both the XXXX and XXXX XXXX jobs, which I had supplied verification for. She said that she felt like it was an error and would submit a request to have to looked at. She also told me to call the StudentAid.gov to make sure they had supplied that information. I did call them, and they said that MOHELA did have that information. I called several other times and was told by those reps that they couldn't understand why those loans weren't forgiven. One rep hung up on me because it was XXXX, and they were closing. Today, I waited half an hour to get a call back only to be transferred after listening to my plight for a few minutes. I was put on hold for XXXX minutes with no one checking in with me or anything. It felt like a joke. I sent many messages through MOHELA 's website, but they only send me a standard copy and paste message with general information about PSLF. One message said, """" I see you called in, so you probably worked it out already. '' I responded that no one is able to give me information. Again, I repeated my situation and got another generic response about general PSLF information. I asked them specifically about each loan that wasn't forgiven and what employment and what years they don't see as counting. I can't get anyone at MOHELA to answer my questions. I have scoured the MOHELA and StudentAid.gov website. From what I see, MOHELA isn't counting my employment verification prior to XXXX even though I have submitted the TEPSLF employment verification for the last 18 years. Only some of the loans were credited with those years.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","SD","57106","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-15,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8557399,2024

When I rectified and my payment was {$0.00}, for some reason, the IBR wasn't applied to all loans so 1 erroneously went into default. That year, I got my tax refund garnished and the money was sent to that student loan. I contested it with the IRS and they agreed that it shouldn't have been garnished and sent me the money back after it was already applied to the loan. The loan servicer instead of increasing the balance for what they returned to the IRS created an entirely new loan for what they sent back. This really, really screwed my PSLF. At the time they did that, I was coming close to XXXX PSLF payments and loan forgiveness. All of my loans did get forgiven except the newly created one ( that they never ever should have 1 ) garnished and 2 ) created a new loan for .... it was on an existing loan that they should have just reversed the payment from the IRS not started a new loan! ) That has to be illegal. Anyways, because they started a new loan instead of just reversing the payment, it lost all the history. I want my history applied to that ridiculously newly created loan that they never had my authorization to do nor create so that is can get forgiven with PSLF since I am eligible.

I'm an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and I work at XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

I've done multiple terms with XXXX and amassed a sizable education benefit that I've been trying to use toward my student loan payments since XXXX. I was never invoiced for XXXX so found out in XXXX that I was past due. I followed the process to send payment from my XXXX education account immediately, but MOHELA rejected the payment. 

On XX/XX/23 I called them and navigated a phone tree for 45 minutes before it dead ended and ended the call. I called again and tried different options and waited 50 minutes to speak with someone. She couldn't figure out why the payments were rejected, so she escalated me to a supervisor. 

That supervisor walked me through resubmitting the payments through XXXX with a slight change in how I did it last time. She assured me it would go through and she said that it was an issue that comes up sometimes with XXXX payments. 

I sent 3 payments that day to catch up my account. 

Today, I received a past due notice of {$1200.00} with threats that I will be sent to collections. They again rejected my 3 XXXX payments even though they walked me through it, and said I did it correctly. 

I'm desperately trying to fix this. I can't get sent to collections because we plan to buy a house soon. I have the money in my XXXX education fund that I worked hard for. I'm trying to pay them, they are very, very difficult to get a hold of, and I need help please. 

I've called and spent multiple hours navigating their phone tree just trying to reach a live person, but I keep hitting dead ends on the phone tree that end the call. I've only been able to actually speak to someone that XXXX time when they walked me through doing the payments ( which still got rejected ). 

Is there anything you can do? Any way you can help me to be able to speak with someone there who can help me? All I need is a way to talk to someone and see why they keep rejecting my payments. 

Their phone system uses social engineering to make it extremely difficult to reach someone. They force you to listen to recorded messages that are over 4 and over 5 minutes long before offering an option on the phone tree which then takes you to another lengthy recording. They bounce you back to the AI assistant and some of the options are just dead ends that don't offer any way forward but to hang up. 

You can try the number yourself to see what I mean- it's XXXX. 

I'm trying to do the right thing, please please help me to reach them. I feel completely helpless and so stressed out.

2024-02-23,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","I filed a complaint regarding this issue on stating the following : in early XXXX Mohela sent me multiple notifications ( digital and by mail ) stating that my Recertification was due and that to """" Avoid missing the recertification deadline of XXXX XXXX, XXXX  '' I needed to Recertify or my payment would go up from {$410.00} to {$1100.00} and I would jeopardize my PSLF and loan repayment progress ( attached ) These threats were reinforced by banners on their webpage and constant reminders throughout the site. Out of fear of risking my progress, I recertified as instructed in XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX when I was informed that I should not have been required to recertify. No one responded via phone and I sent a message and was told I would be contacted in 1-2 business days ( message attached ). No one contacted me but instead on XX/XX/XXXX I received a message that MOHELA Has Placed an Administrative Forbearance on my Account ( attached ). I followed up with Mohela the same day because I was concerned this forbearance would impact my PSLF progress. Once again I heard nothing. Now on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notification that my new Monthly Payment Amount : {$730.00}. The language in the annual recertification is particularly concerning because when REPAYE Plan ( which I was on ) became the SAVE plan, I received a notice ( attached ) which stated : Annual Recertification You won't be required to recertify before payments restart in XX/XX/XXXX, and the earliest you could be required to recertify is six months after the payment pause ends. If your recertification date falls between now and six months after the pause ends, it will be pushed out by one year. This section in the new letter now states ; Annual Recertification The earliest you could be required to recertify is six months after XX/XX/XXXX, when the payment pause ended. If your recertification date falls between now and XX/XX/XXXX, it will be pushed out by one year. I believe MOHELA is deliberately misleading consumers to recertify earlier than required and threatening higher payments and risking loan forgiveness for failing to do so. Furthermore, when consumers ask for assistance, guidance or corrections, MOHELA becomes unresponsive or claims they can not assist. 


Now three agents confirmed on the phone that this issue would be resolved because my recertification date is XXXX AND being placed on forbearance because MOHELA needed time to correct this, The company made up a new date in XXXX. They replied to my complaint saying me recertification date is actually XX/XX/XXXX. Which does not match the date they wrote in their letter Dated XX/XX/XXXX. This is 100 % fiduciary negligence and they are simply making up dates to cover their mistakes after they already acknowledged that they were incorrect!!","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","MD","20910","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-23,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8408534,2024

My previous employment verification was verified up until XXXX XXXX I submitted my form and on XXXX  the form showed on MOHELA 's website that it was received. 

I sent MOHELA an internal message on XX/XX/XXXX stating that my information wasn't showing updated on the Financial Aid website and was not able to process my PSLF verification to ask for loan forbearance. I asked them to look into why my dates of employment were not updated on the federal website. I spoke to a customer service representative with a trainer on the phone call to ask how long the process was going to take. He stated 90 days from XXXX I asked if I needed to fill out another form and he stated, that they would be able to count the payments internally. 

On XXXX, I received a response from the message center and this is their response """" Thank you for contacting MOHELA, Our records indicate that you called and spoken to one of our Customer Service Representatives regarding this inquiry. We will assume the inquiry has been handled. '' I received a denial letter on XXXX  stating that I didn't meet the remaining 5 payments of the student loan for the PSLF. my previous form was updated until XXXX  ( according to their website ).

I don't know what else to do. I've submitted my PSLF form, MOHELA held onto it since XXXX  and denied it on XXXX stating that I didn't have enough payments to meet the criteria.

On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX I called MOHELAs PSLF line at XXXX XXXX. I was placed on hold for an hour before a representative answered the phone. The reason for my call was that 8 of my payments have been improperly marked as ineligible for PSLF even though they are eligible under either TEPSLF waiver or the IDR waiver. I had uploaded 3 pieces of explanation and documentation on XX/XX/year> that Mohela had moved from processing to canceled three weeks later without explanation. 

When I spoke to a representative, I requested to be transferred to a supervisor from the Escalation Team. Instead she kept me on the line for an additional 20 minutes only to tell me that she had spoken to a representative who said the payments were correct and being looked into. Those two statements contradict themselves. Either the payments are correct or they are being looked into. I requested to speak to the Supervisor myself and was placed on hold before being informed that all members of the team are busy and you will receive a call back in two business days. The line then hung up. 

I then called the Ombudsmens Office since I have an active and open case with FSA that they failed to respond to within the allotted 15 days. I was again on hold for 30 minutes before speaking to a representative who mentioned he was part of the investments team and incorrectly surmising that the payments were not qualifying because I did not certify my employment. The issue at hand is first that payments were made prior to consolidating with Fed Loan Servicing while working for a qualifying employer and second that payments were made during an inappropriate period of forced forbearance. 

I am now on hold again in hour 3 of being placed on hold. While on hold MOHELA called and when I went to answer had hung up. Then after 3 hours on hold with the office of FSA waiting to be transferred to a supervisor that line hung up on me as well.

I formerly request that both Mohela and FSA respond to this letter in writing with an explanation of why my uploaded forms were canceled as well as that I receive an updated an increased payment count from XXXX to XXXX or an explanation of why they can not be updated as such. MOHELA and now XXXX have been placed on notice and has 60 days to respond to this action before further legal action will be taken.

2024-02-23,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","I am reaching out to bring to your attention a distressing and frustrating situation concerning the mishandling of my student loan discharge by MOHELA ( Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority ). I believe my experience highlights potential systemic issues that may impact numerous individuals nationwide, necessitating urgent inquiry and intervention. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I received notification from MOHELA that my loans had been forgiven under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) program. However, I subsequently discovered that while my graduate loans were appropriately forgiven, my undergraduate loans still showed a balance. Upon contacting MOHELA, I was advised to reapply, and after doing so, a few weeks later, I was informed of a refund of over {$4900.00} for overpayment. 

To my dismay, when I inquired about the refund in XXXX, I was told it had been sent to the US Treasury and would likely be paid out by the end of the year. However, upon further investigation in XXXX, MOHELA provided conflicting information, asserting that no refund was due. They explained that the overpayment had been applied to my outstanding undergraduate loans, which were forgiven under the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan, not PSLF. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my account displayed a {$0.00} balance, confirming the discharge of my loans. However, a few hours later, I received an email from MOHELA stating my account was in """" Administrative Forbearance. '' Upon contacting them, I was informed that my loans had been erroneously discharged and subsequently reinstated, now reflecting a balance exceeding {$46000.00}. 

I am writing to express my complete and utter disgust with the handling of my loan discharge by MOHELA. The inconsistency in information provided during my interactions with their representatives is both bewildering and distressing. It raises serious concerns not only about the accuracy of the information disseminated by MOHELA but also about the legality of reinstating loans that were purportedly discharged.

I implore you to investigate this matter urgently, as I believe there may be numerous individuals facing similar situations. The emotional and financial toll on borrowers subjected to such erratic and unexplained actions by loan servicers is immeasurable. It is crucial that steps be taken to rectify this issue promptly and prevent further harm to borrowers who rely on the integrity of student loan forgiveness programs. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and trust that your office will take the necessary steps to ensure a thorough examination of MOHELA 's practices and accountability. If there is any additional information or documentation needed to aid in your investigation, please do not hesitate to contact me.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","MI","484XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-23,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8408553,2024

This form serves as my official application for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, as I have met XX/XX/XXXXmonths of qualifying employment and payments. I have waited over XX/XX/XXXX years for this day to occur and I have officially met the requirements to receive PSLF and for my loans to be discharged. 

MOHELA takes XX/XX/XXXXdays to process my paperwork. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from MOHELA stating that there is an error on my employment verification paperwork. This is completely false and I have the physical and electronic form to prove that the form was completed correctly. I called MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX and waited for XXXX minutes to speak to a representative. I explained my concern and ask them to manually review the employment verification form. They confirm that MOHELA in fact made an error and my form was correctly completed. MOHELA puts in a request for the problem to be rectified and for the PSLF counts and employer to be updated. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from MOHELA indicating they have placed my account into forbearance. I did not approve this or request this. I call MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX and I am on hold for XXXX minutes before I speak to a representative. I speak to the representative and they are unable to explain why my account has been placed in forbearance. I request that this be rectified and that I speak to a supervisor. I wait XXXX minutes and I am then connected to a supervisor. I request to be taken out of forbearance and I ask that they review the error from the previous day. Later that evening, the MOHELA website updated my employer verification form and qualifying payments, but my account remains in forbearance ( listed until XX/XX/XXXX ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted MOHELA again by phone to inquire about the forbearance status on my account. I wait for XXXX minutes and then speak to a representative. I again explain that I never gave permission or approval for my account to be placed in forbearance. They give me no explanation of why I was placed in forbearance and they provided no timeline on when this will be rectified.

I emailed MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX in order to request information about the status of my Public Service Loan Forgiveness application. As of XX/XX/XXXX no one has responded to my XXXX emails and I have received no communication regarding my application for loan forgiveness. My account is still in forbearance and I am anxiously waiting for my loans to be forgiven. When I called MOHELA to request additional information, they give a blanket statement that it could take up to XX/XX/XXXXdays to process. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX I have completed my obligations under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. I have XXXX qualifying payments and I have been waiting on MOHELA to process my application since XX/XX/XXXX. I deserve timely answers and responses.

I called Mohela asking about why this occurred and Mohela XXXX XXXX said each account was supposed to be corrected """" manually '' and interest accrued returned to the borrower. 

On XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  before my loans with Mohela started back from the pandemic pause, my total balance was {$170000.00} ( {$150000.00} principal and {$18000.00} in interest ) and yet when my loans on XX/XX/XXXX appeared on Mohela 's website, my current principal ( of the consolidated loan ) was {$170000.00} and my accrued interest was {$650.00} and my payoff amount was {$170000.00}.

I completed an online form to check eligibility. I did not know or understand the information provided that I was applying for or consenting to a change in payment terms. I was only checking to see if I was eligible for a lower payment. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received correspondence from the servicer informing me that I had been enrolled in a new payment plan and that my account was in an administrative forbearance. 

I emailed the servicer through their online portal and explained that I did not want the new payment plan and that the change had been made without my consent. I called their customer service line to discuss the situation and was informed that receiving a response or resolution could take up to a month. Since the increase was less than a dollar, I informed the representative that I would like the account noted that I was dropping my original complaint and would accept the new payment plan. I inquired if I would need to make double payments once out of administrative forbearance and was told no.

On XX/XX/XXXX my husband and I called Mohela to apply for the SAVE repayment plan. We spoke to the same representative and applied at the same time with the same financial information. My husbands application went through without issue and his payment is roughly the same amount as estimated during that phone call. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my account was placed in administrative forbearance while they finished processing my application. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a repayment options estimate from the phone call on the XXXX that states my payment amount is estimated to be {$310.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my application for the SAVE payment plan was denied because they could not verify my husbands income ( despite the fact that they service his student loan and have all of his income information ). They requested I upload proof of his income, which I did immediately on XXXX XXXX. I was also notified on this day that my payment would default to my prior IDR payment of {$620.00}, a payment that I can not afford. 

After uploading my husbands pay stub and emailing Mohela that I had done so, I heard nothing back for 2 weeks, so I called on XXXX XXXX to check in and see if there was anything else they needed from me and to also notify them that I could not afford the {$620.00} payment coming due on XXXX XXXX. During this phone call, the representative said that because that original application was denied, a new application should be placed. So I agreed and applied with the same financial information as before. At the end of this call, the representative estimated my payment to be in the $ XXXX and she extended my forbearance while this new application was processing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my loan had been placed on the SAVE repayment plan with a monthly payment amount of {$290.00}. However, a day later, I was again notified that my loan had been placed on the SAVE repayment plan with a monthly payment amount of {$410.00}. So I called again to find out what was going on with my account and why I had these two amounts being processed. The representative stated that the original application continued to be processed along with the second one placed during the last phone call. This representative suggested, since both had been processed, that we should put in another application to start fresh. Again, I supplied the same financial information and she estimated my payment to be in the $ XXXX. And again, my loan was placed in forbearance while this processed. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received the newest payment plan information which stated my loan had been placed one the SAVE plan with a monthly payment amount of {$510.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the main line and asked to speak to a supervisor after being on hold for XXXX minutes. The representative connected me through to the supervisor line where I was met with an automated message saying no one was available to take my call and to leave a message with a call back number. I did so, but when they reached out to me, it was in the middle of my work day and I was unable to answer. When I tried returning their call with the number provided in my voicemail, the number was an information only line for the PSLF program and there were no options to connect or speak to anyone. 

A couple days later, on XX/XX/XXXX, I called to ask why my payment amounts had been so wildly different and why there was such difficulty in processing my applications. This representative placed me on hold for several minutes, Im assuming she was speaking to another department, she finally stated that my loan would be placed on the SAVE plan with the original payment plan amount of {$290.00}. She said that she placed an acceleration on this request and that this payment amount should process by the time my next payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XXXX XXXX, I received notice that there was a processing delay of up to 90 days of this most recent request and that my payment of {$510.00} would be due on XXXX XXXX. I wasnt able to call to address this until XX/XX/XXXX. When I spoke to the next representative, she stated that the request as stated during the XXXX call was processing and that she would place my account on forbearance, again, until it was complete. She verified that there was an acceleration on the request and that everything that could be done, was being done. Despite these reassurances, on XXXX XXXX, a payment was processed on my account for the {$510.00}. 

Most recently, on XXXX XXXX, I received notification of ( what I assume ) is the processing of the request placed during the phone call on XXXX XXXX which states my new payment amount will be {$410.00} and not the {$290.00} amount as promised on the phone. 

As you can see, it has been a series of incompetent mistakes and miscommunications within Mohela that has lead to 5 months worth of stress and frustration for me. I have been more than communicative and proactive to resolve issues. Each phone call results in the representatives telling me one thing and two to three weeks later, something completely different happens. In order to speak with them, I have to get up at XXXX XXXX time to call if I dont want to be on hold for an hour. Their customer service time frame is very inconvenient for people on the west coast. I work full-time and do not have the luxury of being on hold for prolonged periods of time during my work day to wait to talk to some and at this point, I am at a loss for what to do as calling the customer service line or requesting to speak to a supervisor has resulted in nothing helpful. I did file a complaint via the Contact Us page with Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX, but their only reply to me was that since I had been calling and speaking with customer service, they assumed my issue had been resolved.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","WA","98387","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-18,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8370327,2024

2024-02-16,"Student loan","Private student loan","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","To whom it may concern : My name is XXXX XXXX, and I am a resident of XXXX XXXX. I have proof that for the last XXXX  years, at least, University Accounting Service ( UAS ) has been willfully and knowingly deceiving its customers into paying thousands of dollars above and beyond what they should have been paying for student loans. The proof of this allegation can be seen in my own account. 

Since XXXX, UAS has been the loan service provider for a private student loan I took out as a XXXX XXXX in XXXX. In XXXX, after I XXXX XXXX XXXX and my repayment period started, I was provided with a bill that included the following information : Original Loan Amount : {$5000.00} Current Principal : {$5000.00} Previous Balance : {$7500.00} Current Balance : {$7500.00} Total Amount Due : {$81.00} When I had the funds to pay the bill, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I paid a total of {$160.00} {$8.00} went to late fees and {$150.00} went toward interest. A second payment of {$85.00} was made XXXX XXXX, XXXX, of which UAS said {$40.00} went to interest and {$44.00} went toward the principal. However, in the statement issued XXXX XXXX, XXXX, which included both of those payments, the current principal was still listed at {$5000.00}. 

The current principal balance of {$5000.00} did not start to decrease until the statement dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX. By that point, UASs own records show that I had paid nearly {$2500.00} toward the principal. How could that be if the principal amount on my account had not decreased a single cent since I started repayment? 

As of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I have paid a total of XXXX on a {$5000.00} loan XXXX in interest and XXXX in principal and UAS says I still owe roughly {$1500.00}. How can that be if the principal when I started repayment was {$5000.00}? 

I called UAS about this issue XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to request a review of my account. XXXX XXXX  later, I called back to check on that review and spoke to a manager who said that the interest that accrued on my account during its original deferment period while I was still in XXXX  had capitalized and become part of my principal balance, meaning the principal when I started repaying was roughly {$7500.00}. 

However, nothing in the documentation that I received from UAS indicated that this had occurred. On the very first statement I received, the following note about accrued interest is included : If you have a deferred principal plan, any amount of interest that is not paid may be capitalized. If you are unable to pay the full amount of interest accrued, you may make a partial payment or none at all, and the remaining accrued interest may be capitalized. If your account is set-up for deferred principal payments and the interest remains unpaid and becomes delinquent, that interest may be capitalized. When interest is capitalized, it is added to the current principal balance and subject to future interest charges.

As we all know, the word may does not mean will, and that if there is no other indication that the interest had capitalized ( i.e. the current principal amount included on the statement did not include a capitalized amount ), then it should be safe for a customer to assume that the interest had not, in fact, been capitalized.

But, despite my belief that I was simply paying down the original loan amount as well as the interest that had accrued, UAS was charging interest on the entire roughly {$7500.00} instead of the {$5000.00} that was listed on my statements costing me thousands of dollars in the process and extending my payment period far beyond what it should have been.

This practice is deeply deceptive, predatory and keeps borrowers in debt for far longer than they should be. Like I said above, I have paid more than {$13000.00} on this {$5000.00} loan and am being told that I still owe more. If thats not the definition of a predatory practice, I dont know what is.

Im hoping that your office can investigate this matter thoroughly and put an end to predatory debt collection practices such as those employed by UAS.

After dedicating XXXX  years of my life XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXn, I am deeply disheartened by the fact that my student loans have not been forgiven when the laws is clear and says 10 years of service. It is distressing to see that organizations like Mohela are taking advantage of individuals like myself who are underserved. 

I am left with no choice but to request the forgiveness of my student loans. As the wife of an XXXX veteran, I am considering taking legal action against Mohela for their failure to approve my application. During my extensive tenure at the non-profit, I have wholeheartedly committed myself to our cause, tirelessly working to positively impact the community we serve. I have personally witnessed the transformative effects our organization has had on countless individuals, and it has been an honor to be a part of this meaningful work. 

Despite my unwavering dedication and service to our mission, the burden of student loan debt continues to cast a shadow over me. The financial strain of repaying these loans poses a significant challenge, and I had hoped that my commitment to public service would make me eligible for loan forgiveness. It is my belief that individuals like myself, who have devoted their careers to serving others through non-profit work, should not be burdened with overwhelming student loan debt. Loan forgiveness for public servants is a vital incentive that plays a crucial role in attracting and retaining talented individuals within the non-profit sector. 

I humbly request your support in advocating for the forgiveness of my student loans. Such an action would not only alleviate a substantial financial burden on me but also enable me to continue my work with renewed dedication and focus.

Recently, i received a credit report decrease due to my student loans increasing in the thousands.

In addition, I applied to renew my XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. It was approved and assessed by the Department of Education, and sent to MOHELA ; on XX/XX/XXXX. My estimated payment was approximately {$650.00} per month. 

In early XXXX, MOHELA sent an email with my new estimated payment. They are asking {$5600.00} per month, almost my entire paycheck. I called for clarification and was on hold for XXXX hours. At that point, I was told they put me on the straight repayment plan and said they had many repayment options to include XXXX. When I explained that I applied for that in XXXX, the service agent did not know why it wasnt considered and sent me to a XXXX. I was on hold an additional XXXX hours. I was assured that it would be expedited and processed in XXXX days. 

A week later, I received a letter that my request was being delayed and I could expect an ANSWER in XXXX BUSINESS days. If approved, it will end up taking 7 months just to approve my IDR amount approved by the Department of Education within a week. 

In the meantime, I either have to pay my entire paycheck, leaving no money for my house payment, food, medicine and services for my daughter, and utilities ; go into default ; or hope to get a forbearance, which will increase my interest AND push back my eligibility for XXXX due to their incompetence. 

They should be held accountable and should be required to put us on PSLF counting forbearance, and all interest be waived, until they get their act together.

I made my payment for XXXX on XXXX electronically like I always do thinking the payment was taken care of because I had the confirmation numbers XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. My wife told me on XXXX the payment still hasn't come out of our checking account. I gave it a few more days until the XXXX and I called my bank, and they said nothing has been presented to the bank. I hung up with the bank and immediately called NelNet. and spoke to customer service representative XXXX. He could see where I made the payment and had the confirmation #. He said my bank returned the request because I did not have enough money in the bank to cover the payment. I told him that was not possible because I have more than enough to cover a payment of {$730.00}. I asked to speak to a supervisor. XXXX transferred me to Resolution Specialist XXXX in the XXXX XXXX. She could see the same thing showing where I made the payment and could see the confirmation numbers. She wanted to know how she could help. I explained to her there is something wrong on their end or with their system or personnel. I make the payment online on their website and it shows the payment is pending and the next day there is nothing pending. I contact my bank, and nothing has been presented to my bank at all. Now, it's past my due date and I am late. I don't like being late because I value my credit. I just want them to honor the payment I made electronically on XXXX and present the request to the bank and back date my payment to reflect the date I made the payment. XXXX said she could not do that. I asked her to explain what happened initially on their end and why the payment was not presented the first time to my bank. She had no answers at all. She said maybe I entered the wrong number or something. I explained I have a banking/mortgage/loan servicer background and I am particularly careful when entering banking information online because I do it every day for my job. To not argue with XXXX and preserve my credit, I went ahead and made another payment with XXXX over the phone on XXXX. Miraculously that payment had no problem going through on XXXX however on that payment now I had to pay an extra 10 days ' worth of daily interest on all the loans. Also, she did not do what I asked her to do which is apply the {$730.00} to each loan. She only applied the {$730.00} only to loan XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. If they check their records for every payment of {$730.00}, I have applied the same amount every month. I apply {$160.00} to Loan XXXX, I apply {$200.00} XXXX XXXX. I apply {$210.00} to XXXX XXXX. I apply {$140.00} to XXXX XXXX. This is how I wanted her to apply the payment this time on XXXX she did not do that. I asked XXXX to review the payment history on this account. I have been making payments since XX/XX/XXXX electronically just like I did this time. I have worked in banking / mortgages and loan servicing for 25 years. I know mistakes happen, but I also know the customer should not be penalized for an error that occurred on the loan servicer 's end. Also, the carless disregard to say I don't know what happened and there is nothing you can do and then never bother to find out what happened on their end so the real issue can be resolved with no impact to the customer is unacceptable for me. I told XXXX that I would be making a complaint after checking with my bank. I have checked with my bank and their letter is attached. The XXXX Manager XXXX XXXX researched with their Accounting Department and their research determined there was never any payment request presented to the bank at all on my account. The only payment presented was on XXXX and that payment cleared with no problem. if I need to, I will contact my lawyer if I need to take this further. If this is happening to me, I can only image how many other people this is happening to, and they never say anything because they are too busy. I am busy but I got time for this. I stand on principle and for what is right, and I always will. I would like my payment from XXXX to be back dated and I would like the payment applied as stated above spread among all XXXX loans and not to advance the due date. 

Situation # XXXX *************************************************************************************************** ********I will be calling NelNet again to try to get this resolved again on XXXX ********* *************************************************************************************************** I made my XXXX payment electronically on NelNet 's website on XX/XX/XXXX, and I received confirmations numbers XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. I also designated {$160.00} to loan XXXX, {$200.00} to XXXX XXXX, {$210.00} to loan XXXX and {$140.00} to loan XXXX. All of these amounts total us to {$730.00}. On XXXX is showed all of these payments pending. On XXXX it's showing nothing is pending, like I have never made the payment at all. I am very confused and don't know what is going on with NelNet 's electronic payment process. NelNet has received all of my other electronic payments with no problem. The last two payments XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX will not process through their website. I know when My wife had her student loans with NelNet she had all kinds of problems like this with NelNet. I assume My XX/XX/XXXX payment did not go through either. I have not received an email, or a call, or text message to say your payment did not go through or anything. I am just being more vigilant because I see this could become a problem if I don't stay on top of this or it could be by NelNet 's design to get extra fees or more interest. I called my bank today and they said no electronic payment from NelNet has been presented to the bank against my account all. I don't know what's wrong on NelNet 's website or payment process which is not allowing my XXXX payment to process. It may be a personnel issue or a system issue or something, but I can't put my finger on it. I would like this payment to be back dated to reflect to the day I actually made the payment XXXX and as stated above and not advance the due date.","","Nelnet, Inc.","TX","77073","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-23,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8405495,2024

Having recently completed XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/2023, I promptly applied for the XXXX XXXX. However, my loan servicer shifted from XXXX to MOHELA, resulting in a series of issues with my application for the income payment repayment plan. Despite numerous calls ( XXXX thus far ) and attempts to seek resolution since XXXX, the processing of my application has not progressed, leaving me in a state of uncertainty. 

Every time I have contacted the servicer for updates, I have been provided with a standard response indicating a XXXX processing time. Regrettably, it has been almost XXXX months, and I am still without any concrete information about the status of my application. Furthermore, my attempts to speak with a supervisor have been consistently unsuccessful, leaving me without a higher authority to address these concerns. 

In addition to the protracted processing time, I have encountered difficulties in navigating the forbearance process. This has added to the overall frustration and anxiety associated with my student loan management. 

I believe these issues are not only impacting my financial stability but may be indicative of broader problems within the loan servicing system. Therefore, I am seeking the assistance of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency in investigating and addressing these concerns promptly.

I appreciate your attention to this matter and trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Agency will take the necessary steps to ensure the fair and efficient resolution of these issues.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","MI","49048","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-13,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8339037,2024

On your account XXXX XXXX page, you XXXX still see a recertification date that is earlier than XX/XX/XXXX. We are working to get those updated, and we thank you for your patience. 

If your recertification date falls between now and XX/XX/XXXX, it will be pushed out by XXXX year. For example, if your account says your recertification date is XXXX XXXX, XXXX, that date will be pushed out to XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

I have physical notices from MOHELA telling me I need to recertify by XX/XX/XXXX, and the XXXX website says my XXXX anniversary date is XXXX, and that XXXX is """" the date when your IDR amount resets based on your recertification. 
How can I be forced to submit docs by XX/XX/XXXX, with my XXXX amount resetting, based on my recertification, on XXXX, and yet MOHELA calls those """" soft dates '' and XX/XX/XXXX the """" hard date. '' It looks like XX/XX/XXXX is the due date of when payment is due not recertification date. 

They define the hard date as the first day you would pay into your now-recertified plan if you submitted recertification docs on time. So for me, because I pay on the XXXX of the month, my """" hard date '' is XX/XX/XXXX.

2024-02-09,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","MOHELA 's website indicated that my account was due to to recertify my income for my income driven repayment plan, PAYE. On their website, they listed XXXX dates : XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. MOHELA 's website directs clients to recertify at XXXX. 

When I logged into studentaid.gov, I chatted with XXXX, the chatbot for the website who stated that """" the earliest you could be required to recertify is XX/XX/XXXX. Any date listed between now and XXXX first will get pushed out by a year. '' When I checked my IDR anniversary date on the StudentAid website, It lists XX/XX/XXXX. 

Based on this information, I was made to believe that my income recertification would be pushed back by a year ( XX/XX/XXXX falls before XX/XX/XXXX ) to XX/XX/XXXX and so did not recertify. When I went to check this date on the Mohela website, it now says that I am past due to recertify, my loans will capitalize, and I may be removed from the PSLF qualifying PAYE plan. 

I called Mohela on XXXX and received a callback from a supervisor on XXXX to ask what happened, and they stated that the """" hard date '' to recertify is actually XX/XX/XXXX as this is when my next payment would be due. When I informed them that all client facing dates provided would have fallen within the window on studentaid.gov and could they provide documentation or direct me to the area on the website that listed XX/XX/XXXX as the deadline, they could not do this. 

Mohela 's refusal to honor the studentaid.gov website of pushing back my IDR date will cause significant financial hardship. Having to recertify now ( vs 1 year from now ) will cause my monthly payment to increase by {$1100.00} and cost me over {$13000.00} over the next year. Any payment plan that would result in a lower payment would not qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.

The fact that Mohela is using dates to decline clients from qualifying for the push back of income recertification discussed on the studentaid.gov website that are not CLIENT FACING and that they CAN NOT VERIFY online or in writing is fraudulent and misleading. This seems to be in violation of the Unfair Deceptive or Abusive Acts and Practice Law.

The length of time this has required ( because of how long it takes Navient to process information ) has led to exceeding the expiration date of my previous IBR plan and now threatens to increase my payment by a factor of 8, even though my income has remained the same. This is not fair. I need Navient to stop taking their time with processing my information and update my payment amount to reflect a new IBR plan. I have given them everything they have asked for very promptly, but they seem to be dragging their feet. Since I submitted my application well before the previous IBR plan expired, and the delay is only a paperwork issue, I should not have to wait this long and risk needing to have my loans placed in forebearance ( and accrue unnecessary interest at my expense ) when the delay is Navient 's fault.","","Navient Solutions, LLC.","MI","490XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-29,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8453324,2024

I filled out the application as normal and it was rejected due to my name change. This is understandable. I sent in proof of my new name and thought everything was all clear. 

My application was not accepted AGAIN, but I was not informed. I called Nelnet ( XXXX hour wait time which is hard for anyone ) and talked to XXXX person that says now the date is incorrect and where the application asked for the years of employment ( from____-to____ ), there should be a date on """" to ''. I stated """" If you fill out a job application and they ask about your employment history you would say """" current '' if you still worked there correct? '' Once stated, the representatives would agree but escalate me to someone hire up because I had been told all I needed to do was change. 

XXXX ( Supervisor Solution Specialist ) said that date was not the issue the letter was rejecting the forbearance which I was not asking for an extension for. They said they have received the application and it would take XXXX  days to process from when they received the application. They received it on XX/XX/XXXX meaning that XX/XX/XXXX it is XXXX days. Now she says the name change is affecting this. The name change is effective XXXX. So XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX ok sounds good. I asked """" could I get proof?

XXXX ( Support Specialists ) understood the issue and said I was correct and tried to create a letter so I would have proof that my application has been accepted but they can't create """" proof '' ( How convenient ). 

I was sent a letter saying my application can not be processed AGAIN. Because of the date I thought this was a from the XXXX other hour long conversations I had had with the company and it could not be from the recent conversation with XXXX, they told me I was good to go. 

It is now XX/XX/XXXX and they are giving me XXXX additional reasons why my application was not accepted. Interest has accrued with no """" reimbursement '' in sight. 

I can't do anything about this at this point. If someone would have simple told me what to """" fix '' in XXXX I would have followed the directions. Every time I call there is a new reason. I feel am getting the run around as a apart of a way to hold me hostage to Nelnet. 

I have made the appropriate adjustments to the new standards. My hope is the work I have done in the XXXX  is appreciated.

It's very difficult to reach a live representative. When I finally was able to speak to someone, he was a trainee and could not understand the problem or how to fix it. After staying on hold for nearly forty-minutes they transferred me to a number that was not a live person.

The information provided by MOEHLA is very inconsistent, confusing, and they refuse to update my PSLF tracker. As such, I will continue to pay on loans way past my eligibility for discharge date.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","MD","21133","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-18,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8545135,2024

Shortly after, the status on studentaid.gov changed to Complete with a note that my servicer would select the best plan and finish the application. 

On XX/XX/24, MOHELA sent a letter stating they are experiencing delays in responding to correspondence, and to expect a response time of 90 business days ( 4 calendar months ). 

On XX/XX/24, I contacted MOHELA by phone to check on the status of my application, as it still had not been processed and my payment due date was approaching. MOHELA assured me they would expedite the review, and to expect it to be resolved within three weeks. My payment due date was pushed out to XX/XX/24. 

On XX/XX/24, I contacted MOHELA by phone again, as I had seen no progress on my application, and my new due date was approaching. This time, I told MOHELA I intended to stay on the phone as long as required for them to fix the issue. This resulted in being transferred to a supervisor. While on the phone, this individual pulled up my IDR application and processed it while I was on the phone with them. After a few minutes, they informed me of my new payment amount, which did not match what I had seen from the payment calculator tool on studentaid.gov. When I pointed this out, the individual admitted to not having entered the information exactly as submitted, but having made assumptions about my tax filing status and family size. I asked the individual to input the information exactly as I had submitted, which they did immediately. I was then told everything was complete, and to expect my account to update online within XXXX hours. This turned out to not be the case. 

I am writing this complaint on XX/XX/24. The application still has not been processed by MOHELA. My payment amount is still incorrect and not reflective of my IDR and updated income, and my payment due date is approaching in two weeks. I am concerned that because my repayment has been delayed so significantly by MOHELA, I am not able to make qualifying payments towards PSLF.

I opened a case with the US Department of Education regarding this matter as well that is still not resolved. I was told via message that the account was in forbearance in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX- but here 's the kicker - I never filed a forbearance request. I believe Mohela is presenting false information to delay approving XXXX loan forgiveness for borrowers so they can prolong receiving money for payments. I even called them out on XX/XX/XXXX in writing to produce proof of a forbearance requested by me at any time in XXXX and they ignored my message- which makes me think someone discovered they were indeed at fault and made a mistake. I received no response other than the templated response they send everyone that says they will address the matter in XXXX business days- well they never responded to my request as to whom requested a forbearance on my account in XXXX if that is true as their representatives claim.

I was excited and ecstatic. I went on with my life for 9 months. This occurred due to me confirming my qualifying employer from XXXX as part of the Limited PSLF waiver opportunity. After submitting, my employment, the payment counts updated. I counted all the payments for each loan from XXXX prior to submitting the Limited PSLF waiver in XXXX and it showed I would be over the number of payments required for PSLF. I confirmed multiple times with multiple Mohela reps in XX/XX/XXXX to confirm it's true. It went through the formal process of Loan Forgiveness. I called almost everyday in XXXX to check on my progress. Then I received the email stating my loans are forgiven. A huge weight was lifted. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I receive a notice with no explanation that my Mohela account is on Administrative Forbearance and the balance is reinstated with over {$2000.00} of interest accrued. I called Mohela and was told by the first rep I spoke to that they see the forgiveness letter and not sure why the balance is reinstated. I was then told that it was a loan discharge error. No reason for why the error occurred and I should have received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX. I received no such letter on the XXXX. I was then directed to the resolution center and left a callback number. I called again and went to the PSLF department of Mohela and was told the forgiveness letter is there and this is not right and the amount should not be there. The PSLF Mohela rep directed me to billing where I waited for 2 hours and hung up because I was getting nowhere and it was XXXX CST on a Friday. 

I called the morning of XX/XX/XXXX and finally got a rep after an hour of waiting. The first rep I spoke to in the morning told me that she saw nothing stating why the loan balance is back and says she sees the forgiveness letter. I was then transferred to an """" Admin '' after waiting for another hour and the admin stated the same thing as the previous rep. The rep stated, """" There is nothing on your account that states you should have a balance. I have gone through everything and I am not sure why you are on Administrative Forbearance. I also see the forgiveness letter '' I was then directed again to a Resolution Center to leave a callback number. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a message call from Mohela in the XXXX  and a rep left a voicemail stating there's an important message and I should call back. I called back, spoke to another Mohela rep that stated """" ... there is no reason why the balance should be on my account. '' And then he stated, """" I should have a received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX stating there's a discharge error. '' This is the second and only time I have heard of a discharge error letter. I received no such letter. The only thing I received is a letter just saying I am on Administrative Forbearance with no reason why it's on Administrative Forbearance. 

On the evening of XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from a Mohela rep that told me my loans were discharged in error due to an error that was found 9 months after my forgiveness was approved. The error was found by the Loan Processing department the week of XX/XX/XXXX. I was also told they miscalculated my employment as well as my PSLF count. They essentially mishandled all of my information and then stated I am obligated to pay back loans. I told the rep that this isn't right and I will not be making payments due to their negligence. I was also told that I would receive 0 % interest until XX/XX/XXXX as an apology for their error and I would have 6 additional months of PSLF added to my current PSLF count. Unclear what my PSLF count is because of all the misleading documentation I have. The rep also told me that it's Mohela 's fault this error occurred. I was also told this error affected around 500 individuals. I was also told there would be """" more benefits to come '' and Mohela is """" working '' with the Dept. of Education. I was also told, """" If you can't afford payments, you can sign up for and IDR plan. '' I was also told by this rep, """" You can apply for PSLF since you have 151 qualifying payments. '' I currently work for a non-qualifying non-profit. So, payments I made with my current employer wont count if I submit my current employment. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter stating my forgiveness was an error and I am obligated to pay back the loans. The letter is also not dated and I feel that's shady because they date all their letters ( see attached documentation ). I also feel that this is the letter I should have received on the XXXX of XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I receive a call marked as spam ( this isn't right and seems the number will show up as spam on smart phones ) and it was a Mohela rep calling to follow up on the correspondence letter I received on XX/XX/XXXX. The rep stated, """" ... interest has not been accruing from the date I had the forgiveness until the date I received the letter. '' When I said to him, """" So, you are telling me, no interest accrued on a {$0.00} balance and now will accrue and continue to accrue starting XX/XX/XXXX? '' He stated, """" Correct. '' Essentially, 0 % interest accrued from XX/XX/XXXX- XX/XX/XXXX. Which makes no sense because there wasn't a balance on the account until XX/XX/XXXX. I then asked why the 0 % interest is not added based on what I was told by a previous Mohela rep on XX/XX/XXXX. He stated, """" You were given misinformation and the rep shouldn't have told you that. '' I was angry and said a lot of expletives to the rep and hung up on the rep because Mohela is literally stating what the rep stated to me on the XX/XX/XXXX isn't correct even though they are part of the same organization. And whatever is in the letter I received on XX/XX/XXXX is basically what I get. I asked to speak to a supervisor and he stated, """" I am the supervisor. There isn't anyone above me. '' I then called Mohela the following morning ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to follow up and the rep stated the exact same thing as the rep from XX/XX/XXXX. I asked to speak to a supervisor for more clarification because I don't know what to do and they have essentially ruined my life and given me no direction. She stated, """" I am the supervisor. There isn't anyone above me. '' Verbatim. I would not be allowed to talk to anybody else. I then asked what they are doing for me and the other folks and she stated, """" We gave you the 0 % interest that lasted from the date of the forgiveness to the date you received the letter stating the error. '' I asked again about the 0 % interest from what the rep told me on XX/XX/XXXX and she said the same thing as the rep from the previous day. I then asked how 0 % interest can accrue on a {$0.00} balance. And like a robot, she stated that this is the perk we received due to this error and interest started accruing XX/XX/XXXX ( even though the account is on Administrative Forbearance. Eventually, she said she would """" escalate '' my situation. I haven't heard back since. 

I told her that's not right and more needs to be done. I also stated I am done with them ; they are a bunch of crooks taking advantage of me ( and others in this situation ) for their mishandling of peoples information and they need to be stopped. Based on a statement/article I read from Biden-Harris : To remedy the impact of these errors on borrowers, the Department directed each servicer to place affected borrowers into administrative forbearance until the issues were resolved. While their loans are in administrative forbearance, borrowers will not owe payments and any accrued interest will be adjusted to zero. Additionally, any months that borrowers spend in administrative forbearance will count as progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness or income-driven repayment forgiveness. The Departments action will ensure that borrowers are not harmed by these servicer errors and that servicers are held accountable for their actions. 

They are not adhering to this at all. They are not adhering to any standards or practices in the loan servicing business. Interest is accruing on an account that is under Administrative Forbearance and they are telling me that I am obligated to pay back the interest that's currently accruing. They have also halted the PSLF count on the account. They also reported the loan amount to two of the three credit bureaus while the account is on Administrative Forbearance. 

Now, I am at the end of my rope. I have contacted lawyers. I have submitted complaints to the Dept. Of Ed Ombudsman as well as my state 's Ombudsman. I am currently disputing my credit reports because these crooks ( Mohela ) are putting the balance back on my credit report without my permission ( not supposed to while on Admin Forbearance according to the Biden-Harris Administration ) and placed a loan balance on my Mohela account when they made this mistake and decide they can just do what they want. 

This is not right. My family and I went on with our lives for 9 months after it was reported to all 3 bureaus that the account was paid in full. I have documentation stating everything is paid in full. 

This is my story. I feel more is going to happen and they are getting away with behavior that is borderline predatory. They are not providing any direction and they keep flip flopping on everything they have told me. 

So, I sent a message to Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX, stating I am not making any payments until they figure their lives out and give me direction. I will not be hamstrung by Mohela due to their negligence and no sense of direction. They need to XXXX it up and eat this cost. They went 9 months before finding this """" error. '' I made a lot of phone calls to them during the month of XX/XX/XXXX to confirm that my loans were forgiven. I got a lot of """" CONGRATULATIONS '' from Mohela reps in XXXX. I move on with my life and now I am back again in the muck with these transgressors ( Mohela ). 

More people need to know what Mohela is doing with people 's lives and how they flip flop, sticking to a script, and not providing any real direction for me ( and other borrowers ). They shouldn't be in the business of handling these types of documents and processes. They are not Gods because they have control of a system they own. This is not right and they need to be held accountable for their actions to those of us trying to make it day by day.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","IL","60637","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-19,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8577764,2024

2024-03-21,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Need information about your loan balance or loan terms","*I had all this neatly spaced but seeing the final version it's one block of text. Sorry. XX/XX/XXXX, I started the process of consolidating my student loans to move them over to Mohela. I was told then ( I think by someone at XXXX, which previously held some of my loans ) that the process would take XXXX weeks and my new loan payment would end up being $ XXXX. I was dealing with all this stuff in XXXX because I wanted to be in a position to buy a house in XXXX, XXXX. Based on the info I was given in XXXX, this seemed very reasonable and I even had a month or so buffer between when the XXXX weeks would be up and when I wanted to start shopping for a house. I'm a first time homebuyer, this is a very big deal. I've been trying to get everything in order for the past year to be able to do this. 

Specially, in early XXXX, XXXX, I asked for my loans to be consolidated, and my payments to be recalculated in whatever way would make them the cheapest. I am enrolled in the PSLF program, paying off the total loan amount is not the goal, I just need to get through the 10 years of payments. Actually Mohela messed up my PSLF info too, though that seems to have been resolved now so not what the complaint is about. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I was approaching the XXXX week mark that I was told would be when I should expect my consolidation and new loan calculation to go through. There was no information anywhere. The Mohela site said nothing. Like, literally nothing. My account showed up but there was no info even about my total loan amount. I called Mohela. They told me to call XXXX so I did that. XXXX told me the consolidation was done so it was all up to Mohela now. Called Mohela again, they said there's nothing they can do. So I called the XXXX XXXX XXXX, they also said there's nothing they could do, I have to go through Mohela. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a complaint to the XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, explained the situation, they said they'd respond within XXXX days. They did not respond. 

XX/XX/XXXX, Called Mohela again. Spoke to XXXX, who could not help me with anything and didn't know anything but she transferred me to someone who supposedly would be able to help with everything. That person never picked up, I waited on hold for about XXXX minutes and then had to go to bed. 

When I called on XX/XX/XXXX, I did ask XXXX if there was any way I could get a sort of promissory note or something that would provide an estimate of what my new loan payment was expected to be. She seemed to think that was ridiculous. In any case, it didn't happen, is apparently not something they do. I was just thinking if I had something showing that my recalcuation is in progress and the estimated payment amount is {$330.00}, this is much better than me having no information to give to the bank. Anyway that didn't work either. 

XX/XX/XXXX, Called Mohela again. Spoke to XXXX. At this point the consolidation is finally showing up on Mohela 's site, but they never did the recalculation. It shows that my loan payment is $ XXXX and not the {$330.00} I had been quoted before the process began. XXXX says she'll put the XXXX XXXX XXXX request through again and request that mine be completed within XXXX business days. 

XX/XX/XXXX, called Mohela again. Spoke to XXXX. Day XXXX has come and gone, I get an email about a """" correspondence processing delay '' from Mohela. Now they are saying they'll process that information within XXXX business days. Which is obviously much different from XXXX business days and basically means I won't be able to buy a house in the timeframe I need. XXXX tells me that IDR recalculation takes up to XXXX days usually, I was told XXXX days incorrectly ( because every time I call, they have different info, it's never the same thing, none of the people answering the phones seem to know anything concrete ). In any case, this ( XX/XX/XXXX ) is day XXXX and I have heard nothing about the IDR recalculation. 

I also submitted a 2nd complaint to the XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, they never responded to the first one ( and I did cite that reference # in the 2nd complaint ).

I am really at my wit 's end here. I feel like my financial information is being held hostage. Now Mohela is also going through this platform transition, and whenever that happens it means I won't be able to access anything for 20 days ( Mohela 's estimate so it'll probably be longer than that ). Basically I need this to be resolved before that happens so I can buy a house. They are really hurting people, all these changes with student loans were supposed to make things easier for borrowers but this has been an absolute nightmare.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","KY","402XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-21,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8596155,2024

2024-02-19,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","SUMMARY : Because of Nelnet 's poor communication and action, I have not had all of my loans placed on the SAVE plan, despite having applied for and approved for the XXXX plan since XX/XX/2023. 

HISTORY : I was originally approved for the SAVE plan when it was first announced, back in XXXX of XXXX However, since I XXXX  from XXXX XXXX  in XX/XX/2023 and received a 6 month grace period on some of my loans, those loans were kept in forbearance rather than put on the SAVE plan. On XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX I sent an email about how to make sure that the rest of my loans were put on the SAVE plan once the grace period ended, and they told me that my loans would be automatically considered for the SAVE plan within 20 business days after the end of the grace period sometime in XXXX. They told me to reach back out if I hadn't heard from them by then. This was a reasonable timeline, so I complied and waited until XX/XX/2023, at which point I was told to wait until XX/XX/2023. This is where the problems started. Documentation of all email threads and screenshots of student loan repayment status from Nelnet 's website are provided as attachments. 

I followed up on XX/XX/2023 saying that I had entered repayment but was on the Standard Repayment and not the SAVE plan, and asked when I would be put on the SAVE plan. I received a reply on XX/XX/2023 from a different agent at Nelnet saying that I was still in the 20 business day-wait period after the end of the grace period, which was false, and also contradicted Nelnet 's own statements. I replied the same day saying there was a mistake and I was past the 20 day period already. Then I received a reply on XX/XX/2023 from another different agent that I had to apply for the SAVE plan. He told me this via a template email about how to apply for the SAVE plan, not addressing my issue at all. This was frustrating because 1 ) I had already applied for the SAVE plan, and 2 ) they did not take into account my specific situation but rather send a scripted reply that did not address my issue. I then replied the same day outlining my situation in full, and asking how I could get the rest of my loans on the SAVE plan. On XX/XX/2023, I received yet another template email from yet another agent, which did not address my issue at all, but instead was an outline of what the SAVE plan was. 

I started a new email thread to the same Nelnet customer service email address ( XXXXXXXX  ) on that same day, hoping that this would get a response that was specific to my issue. However, I had not received any replies by XX/XX/2023. At this point, I received an automated email on XX/XX/2023 stating that I had a {$1300.00} payment due by XX/XX/2023 ( see documents ). Apparently I had entered Repayment status on all my loans, and was on Standard Repayment for many of them. I panicked as I was on the hook for more than a XXXX dollars a month. I reluctantly decided to call Nelnet Customer Service, even though I had read on online forums that it would take 3+ hours of being on hold. I blocked out an entire day so I could get this sorted without paying those monthly pa

yments, which I should not have had to pay in the first place since I was already enrolled in the SAVE plan. My call with Nelnet took over 3 hours. I was on hold for around 1.5~2 hours, at which point I was transferred to a customer agent. She told me that the only thing to do was to re-apply for the SAVE plan from scratch. It would take at most 2 months, so my loans would be put on forbearance until XXXX, which meant I wouldn't have to make payments, but I would accrue the {$1300.00} as interest every month. I was skeptical of this plan, because I didn't want to accrue that much interest, and I had been told that my loan would automatically be placed on SAVE once the grace period ended, but since the agent did not offer any other options I went ahead and did what she said. She offered me the option of applying online OR applying via the phone with her, and I chose to do it with her since I didn't trust Nelnet to handle an online application. 

We spent about half an hour going through and submitting the application. At the end, I decided that I still wanted to talk to someone else to see if there wasn't another option, and told the agent this. She proceeded to curse me out for a few minutes before putting me on hold for another half hour, until another higher-level agent freed up. This last agent was somewhat helpful, as she understood my situation, but she also told me that my only option was to submit a new SAVE application and accrue the interest. This meant putting both my standard repayment loans and my SAVE plan loans into forbearance, which meant I would accrue interest on the SAVE plan loans. I would rather have kept the SAVE plan loans in repayment, but it wasn't an option. She tried to mollify me by saying that it will all be forgiven in 25 years because I was eligible for the student loan forgiveness programs. I pushed back, but ultimately was presented with no other options so gave up. After this call, I regularly checked my Nelnet account to see if my loans were put on the SAVE plan, but there were no updates. 

Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX, which was 2 months and 14 days later, I saw that some of my loans had exited forbearance and entered repayment. None of the Standard Repayment plans had been moved to SAVE. Many of those Standard Repayment plans had entered repayment, but the ones that had been on SAVE were still on forbearance. It was not clear why some loans were on forbearance and some were not. I assume that my agent placed me on a 3-month forbearance because she thought I would have been placed on the SAVE plan by then, but now my forbearance is expiring and most of my loans are still not on the SAVE plan.

At this point, I do not have it in me to try and figure this out with Nelnet. I have received conflicting information from different agents, sent countless emails, been on a call for 3+ hours, accrued $ XXXX in interest with the possibility of a XXXX more each month, and still have no idea when I will be placed on the SAVE plan. I understand that the backend of student loan processing can be complicated, but my sense is that unless Nelnet is forced to take action by someone else, they will give me the runaround and indefinitely delay putting me on the SAVE plan due to their disorganization and/or possibly deliberate obstruction.","","Nelnet, Inc.","GU","XXXXX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-19,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8378597,2024

XXXXwas told I had a wrong name under my account. It was under """" XXXX '' not """" XXXX '' ( which was also an error because that was my maiden name ). 
I asked them to confirm they had my recent employer information on file to count. They did not even though I submitted all the paperwork. I reviewed all of the qualifying employers again. XXXX XXXX and the segal education award was not addressed. Reminded them it'll count towards PSLF. Was told to update new married name once XXXX XXXX moved to XXXX and then to Mohela. 

XXXX Still had my last name incorrect in their current system. Said will have it at Mohela end of XXXX. Clarified how the PSLF will work with all 4 of my different loans. Was told my work full-time at a qualifying employer while also XXXX in graduate school will not count for eligible payment months ( which is over 2 years! ). 

XXXX Said account is still under wrong last name. XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX not applied. Requested my current employer be updated/added again for work. Told will receive email when get loans and qualifying payments from Mohela. 

XXXX called to check the status again. Was told they had to resubmit my documents due to an error and reprocessed them all on XX/XX/XXXX. Told once it's live with Mohela, XXXX XXXXXXXX and XXXX XXXX is applied for qualifying payments. 

XXXX Told that I want to request my time XXXX XXXX in grad school while full time working for an eligible employer count for my payments. And requested a review of my time in XXXX with XXXX XXXX count for my payments since that time and my XXXX XXXX were not applied. The rep said she put in a request to review and revoke the """" ineligible '' status. 

Note- I could never see the status of these revoke requests. Just a general acknowledgement it'll be addressed in ~60-90 days. 

XXXX my husband called on behalf of me. Was told to consolidate the 4 loans, but then was told it would not from a rep in a different call because the buy back program would not apply with us and hurt the possibility of reaching 120 eligible payments earlier than later. 

Note- in between these conversations my husband and I were also working with a financial planner for loan payment plans who also was dissapointed in the communication from the PSLF/Mohela team XXXX Called to ask about loan payment amounts and current status on the payment updates from the paperwork I submitted the last few months. Was told by rep that """" it's looking good and if paperwork goes through I'd be at 133 payments for loan 1 '' and """" 59 payments for loans 2-4 ''. Told to wait and that it should be all updated soon. 

XXXX called again to confirm I'd hear the same thing from a mohela rep. I have 133 payments but not all are/were eligible. The previous rep said they would be eligible if paperwork went through and updated. This is inaccurate. When I talked to a new rep she did not confirm she was seeing an updated payment for eligible payments for my loan 1 at 133. Confirmed that if/when I got to 120 eligible payments for loan 1, I could do the 1 time act adjustment under IDR to consolidate my 4 loans and pay off since loan 1 would be at the payoff since it reached/will reach 120 payments. 

Current status as of XXXX I see a total of 89 qualifying payments for loan 1 and still do not see my full 10 months of XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX being applied and counted, and I do not see where the XXXX XXXX XXXX being applied to count up to 5 eligible payments. 

This is causing a lot of frustration and risk of overall losing money for my family since we have been very patient waiting for an accurate, updated and timely information about my PSLF application, while it accrues interest and we may be paying more overtime vs. just paying it off now. 

I also submitted my XXXX and XXXX XXXX for my current employment to hopefully help proof I am still working for an eligible/qualifying employer. 

Highly disappointed in the experience with the inconsistent information and constant changes of eligibility since the start of my PSLF experience.I should be at or extremely close ( i.e. 1-2 months away ) from reaching the120 qualifying payments for my loan 1.

This complaint specifically addresses MOHELA 's erroneous categorization of the payment period of XX/XX/XXXX, which was under administrative forbearance, as ineligible for PSLF credit, a clear violation of the regulations outlined in 34 CFR 685.205.

Despite the clear guidance on the treatment of administrative forbearance periods in the context of PSLF, and the obligations of servicers as underlined in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's report, MOHELA has failed to adhere to these standards, leading to a significant misrepresentation of my eligibility and progress towards loan forgiveness ( Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, XXXX ). 

Prior to contacting your office, I initiated communication with MOHELA through a formal letter sent on XX/XX/XXXX, demanding an immediate review and rectification of my PSLF payment count. The gravity of MOHELA 's error and its potential to inflict long-term financial damage necessitates the intervention of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX

2024-03-10,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Problem with customer service","During the pandemic, I was facing financial hardships and was worried when things opened back up again that I wouldnt be able to pay my student loans so I did research in consolidating loans and discovered the company SLFD processing. They insured me that if I paid a monthly fee for six months that they would consolidate my loans and put me on a program that was income driven and that their company was qualified in dealing with private and federal loans and consolidation. I paid every month, and when I reached out initially, I was usually was met with someone trying to assure me that the company was legit and that everything would be handled. When President Biden announced his intention to lower student debt, I looked into my current situation, and when I searched for SLFD on the Internet, I found that there were many people who were scammed by SLFD in the same way that I was. I fear that I was a victim of a scam that took money from many people and I am terrified that my information was sold to a third-party and that the money that I spent on my student loans being consolidated is lost forever, which is a huge blow to my current financial situation. I have reached out to them many times and have heard nothing back in response. The last email I got was a message saying that my point persons email no longer exists. The only information I have is that there may be an ongoing investigation into SLFD and that there might be some sort of class action lawsuit but I dont have any of that information and I have not been included in any of those conversations. Please help me get to the bottom of this I am genuinely very scared. Thank you so much for your time and help.

My IDR recertification date states XX/XX/XXXX. The rep I spoke to agreed that it should be pushed back by a year and said that she put in a request and that it would be updated within 3-5 business days. She stated that my payments would remain {$0.00}. I then received a bill from Mohela for {$500.00}. I called Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to multiple individuals, rep, team lead and supervisor. They are stating that I was due to recertify my IDR plan by XX/XX/XXXX. That date has passed and they have increased my payments to the standard payment because I did not recertify by that day. According to the Department of Education, if your IDR recertification falls between the payment pause end date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and XX/XX/XXXX your recertification date will be pushed out a year. My recertification date on Mohela 's website shows XX/XX/XXXX and on studentaid.gov it shows XX/XX/XXXX. Given these dates, according to the Department of Education my new recertification date should be pushed out to XX/XX/XXXX. Mohela said that is not correct and my anniversary date is XX/XX/XXXX. My payments went from {$0.00} based on my most recent IDR application but Mohela is now stating that my monthly payments are {$500.00}.

2024-01-16,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","My federal student loan servicing company is Mohela, and I have been working toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness since XXXX. I have submitted the same request to CFPB, but given the lack of responsiveness and accountability to date I am reaching out to both Senators XXXX and XXXX and Representative XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  is the 120th month of eligible payments on my 13 separate loan accounts, which would make them eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ). The due date on my account is the 1st day of each new month. Following the end of COVID-era forbearance, I resumed payment under the SAVE plan with a monthly payment of {$160.00}. The XXXX payment ( due XX/XX/XXXX ) of that amount was made on XX/XX/XXXX, following receipt of the billing statement. The XXXX payment ( due XX/XX/XXXX ) was made on XX/XX/XXXX, following receipt of the billing statement. The XXXX payment of the same amount was made on XX/XX/XXXX, following receipt of the billing statement. 

The PSLF """" Payment Tracker '' on my Mohela account reflects the XXXX and XXXX payments as being eligible and are reflected in my current count ( as of XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  ) of 118 eligible payments. XXXX is reflected as """" ineligible '' for """" Deferment or forbearance exists for this period. '' XXXX is not yet reflected in either, as the month is not yet complete although my billing date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) has passed. I submitted a PSLF form, signed by my public sector employer, on XX/XX/XXXX. Because this is after my payment due date ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I was advised by Mohela that this would be an eligible payment for XXXX and should have marked the 120th month of repayment and full eligibility for PSLF. 

I called Mohela today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and following a 90-minute wait, was told that this forbearance was placed on my account after my XXXX billing statement had been issued and payment had been made on XX/XX/XXXX. I requested that this forbearance be removed, as it was not requested and a payment was made in response to the XX/XX/XXXX7 billing statement for the XX/XX/XXXX due date. 

I was told this was not possible, though the account never should have been placed in forbearance since a billing statement was issued and payment received for the month. I was advised that I could either wait for the XXXX status to be updated ( estimated date of XX/XX/XXXX according to the representative ), or make a payment in XXXX ( ultimately the 121st payment, beyond the requirements for PSLF eligibility ) and request yet another PSLF form be signed by my employer. I have met the requirements for PSLF forgiveness, and Mohela 's negligence and lack of responsiveness are unnecessarily delaying this federal benefit. Furthermore, there is no recourse for me as the borrower.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","GA","30305","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-16,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8161610,2024

2024-03-03,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I first submitted my IDR application on XX/XX/XXXX and received notice it was processing. My application was then in process without any provided explanation for over 2 months. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received correspondence from MOHELA saying my repayment plans had changed and I had been placed on the LEVEL plan ( standard repayment ). Because I assumed this meant that, without explanation, my IDR application was denied, I then resubmitted my IDR application after receiving this on XX/XX/XXXX. My application was again listed as processing through XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received communication from MOHELA saying my IDR application was approved but MOHELA placed me on the incorrect XXXX plan. I had requested to be placed on the plan with the lowest payment. My husband did the same with his servicer, XXXX, and promptly was placed on the SAVE plan with a payment less than half of what MOHELA provided me on the PAYE plan. Because MOHELA placed us on the incorrect IDR plan, I then resubmitted another application on XX/XX/XXXX. I received a document on XX/XX/XXXX saying I was again placed on the LEVEL plan. 

I then placed a call on XX/XX/XXXX after again receiving this correspondence. The employee I spoke with was XXXX, employee ID XXXX. I received no explanation for these changes, prolonged processing, or mistakes in which repayment plan I had been placed on ( note, I was placed on hold for an hour for the employee to check my account to try to ascertain why these errors are occurring ). I was given the excuses that MOHELA has had a lot of calls and has had updates to its system and that after my latest application, my IDR request will be processed again and can take another 2 weeks. I then asked to speak to a higher level employee who called me back on XX/XX/XXXX. This employee 's name is XXXX, employee ID XXXX. She gave me a case number which I can provide at your request. XXXX told me my case has been escalated further and I should now hear in 3-5 days. 

As of today ( XX/XX/XXXX ), my account is still listed as being under the standard LEVEL plan and per my MOHELA portal, my application is still """" processing.

2024-02-08,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Problem with customer service","When I attended college, my mother took out 4 Parent Plus loans. Last year, I attempted to refinance these loans into my name with a private lender. The total amount of the refinance was approximately {$67000.00}. 

In addition to my loans, my mother also has 3 loans for her schooling and 2 other Parent Plus loans for my brother 's schooling. When the loan servicer ( MOHELA ) received the payoff amount from the private lender ( XXXX ), they mistakenly applied it to my brother 's loans. 

On XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX to find out why this had happened. I was told it was a mistake on MOHELA 's end. I called MOHELA twice on XX/XX/XXXX, once on XX/XX/XXXX, and four times on XX/XX/XXXX. It was almost impossible to reach an actual representative, and the few times I was able to reach a representative, I was told that it was a mistake on XXXX 's end. I assume that XXXX and MOHELA exchanged documents detailing exactly what was to be paid off with the approximately {$67000.00}. I wanted to see those documents as I assume that they specify which loans were supposed to be paid off. MOHELA representatives refused to send me any documents. 

After 7 more calls, I was convinced by a XXXX representative that, despite what the MOHELA representatives had told me, it was in fact MOHELA 's fault. I was also told by a MOHELA team dedicated to servicing XXXX loans that I could place these loans into forbearance while the issues were sorted out so that I would not have to make double minimum payments ( one to XXXX and one to MOHELA ). But after placing the request, I never heard back about the forbearance ( whether it was approved or denied ) and I have been making double payments for several months now. 

In late XXXX, I reached a MOHELA representative who seemed to understand the issue. She said it was an easy fix and she didn't understand why it wasn't resolved quickly. So she supposedly reapplied the misapplied payment to the correct loans. When I checked a week later, I saw that, because the refinance payoff was split into several payments on MOHELA 's website ( for reasons beyond my knowledge ), only about half of the payment had been reapplied correctly. 

On XXXX, I called again ( twice ) and was told that the last half was being correctly reapplied. Several weeks later, nothing had changed on the account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called again ( twice again ) and was told exactly the same thing, that they were putting in a request to fix it. After several weeks, again nothing had changed. So I called again today ( XXXX ). I was told that the request from 13 days before was entered correctly but it was still """" processing ''. 

I asked if they kept records of all of the calls I have made. They told me yes. I asked if I could see them and they said no, that it was somehow private information. After some badgering, the representative agreed to send me some sort of abridged version of the notes ( what this would entail, I was not told ). As of now, I have received nothing. I also asked to speak with a supervisor and was told none were available. After some time on hold, I was told I was being transferred to one. But instead I was sent to a """" survey '' which was a prerecorded message that recorded my complaint and then hung up on me. I called back again and was again told there were no supervisors but that there were some sort of """" advanced agents '' I could speak with. I have been on hold f

or 20 minutes and have not reached anyone. I am now hanging up out of frustration. I have now made exactly 28 calls to solve t

I was informed by a representative that the 10-year standard repayment takes longer to process up to 100 days compared to an income based payment plan which takes 16 days even though the10-year standard plan does not require much paperwork such as tax information for an AGI as does the XXXX. I requested to speak to supervisor and received a call back an hour later. During my conversation with XXXX ID # XXXX I was provided an amount for the 10-year standard as well as the ICR. By comparing the amount the ICR seems to have been s better option because of a lower monthly payment however when I did the calculation online the amount came out to almost double of what I was quoted which was around {$1200.00} a month. Online the amount for ICR came out to over {$2500.00} and the Standard payment option was for 27 years rather than 10 without any option to change the length of time. I called the call center back at Mohella to speak to representative to obtain accurate information or discuss why there was such a difference from what was quoted via phone by a representative versus the online calculator and did not want to submit a request to only find out later that it was a higher amount. This would only delay the process. I called numerous times and got dropped off and when I did reach a representative I was told that I would be transferred to someone who was more skilled to answers this questions but got hung up on again. I eventually reached a rep named XXXX who I was on the phone with all afternoon only to find out that she did not know the reason why the amounts were different and I would need to speak to a supervisor at a resolution call center to obtain accurate information.

2024-03-12,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","XX/XX/XXXX I updated my PSLF waiver online for my employer who I worked for for XXXX XXXX ( non-profit ). This captured all of my non-profit work thus far. XX/XX/XXXX I called MOHELA about the adjusted counts, I was told by MOHELA that they were still working on processing the adjustments. The loans showing I had 123 qualifying payments under PSLF were from XXXX, however, I had loans from XXXX that should have been qualifying. I have always worked for the non-profit so this didn't make sense why the older loans didn't count. A MOHELA agent also agreed and I was told that it would just take some time to check in weekly. 

In XXXX I received a letter I was on administrative forebearance. When I called MOHELA to inquire about consolidation they said I had time because the application for consolidation was moved to XXXX. I consolidated XX/XX/XXXX even though my payment adjustments were still updated. I had 123 on 2 of the 5 loans so I was told it would be best ( by MOHELA ) to consolidate to get the highest payment count. XX/XX/XXXX I received notification that all XXXX of my loans were being consolidated. I called MOHELA weekly to get updates but I kept being told that things were still being processed and no one could answer why were some loans 123 and older ones not updating. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from MOHELA stating that 2 of my loans were forgiven as meeting the 120 qualifying payment count. I again called MOHELA about why all of my loans were not forgiven under the new waiver which states all loans will be forgiven if you consolidate before XX/XX/XXXX. They said a lot of people were experiencing forgiveness and consolidation simultaneously which doesnt make sense. Why would MOHELA process things before having all of the consolidations done after XX/XX/XXXX? 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received another letter from MOHELA that a consolidation was received in the amount of {$22000.00} which is one of my other loans. But in the letter it only states that 1 loan in the amount of {$8100.00} is listed as having been paid in full from consolidation. No other loans are listed on my MOHELA dashboard. On my studentaid account there are two loans showing forgiveness. My MOHELA account and studentaid account do not match up in totals for forgiveness. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called MOHELA about this issue and the agent again stated that this was happening to many people and that it would be adjusted eventually. I asked several times to speak to a supervisor, but no one was available to answer my questions. On XX/XX/XXXX I saw that I had a new loan showing {$47000.00} on my MOHELA account. I then received a letter stating my new payments would begin in XX/XX/XXXX under the SAVE plan. I am still waiting on a call from MOHELA to address the fact that now I am expected to pay under a new loan that is incorrect. 
I also am expected to pay when the system is still updating payments? This all does not make any sense as to why the new waiver was moved to XX/XX/XXXX in order to consolidate all loans to get the highest payment count, but then do a round of forgiveness on partial loans instead of waiting until after the deadline to ensure that all applications are included in that forgiveness. 
XX/XX/XXXX a MOHELA agent informed me that MOHELA will put in a claim complaint on my behalf as well as they also confirmed all of the above. I do have a case number that I have provided in my FSA complaint. 
There is no guidance on this, its a matter of me doing my own research and reading between the lines on student aid website, MOHELA, and following up on the news with regards to new information on student loan forgiveness. I still have a balance that I do not agree with given the fact that I am following the terms of the new forgiveness waiver and the qualifying payment counts. I would appreciate your attention to this matter.

2024-01-23,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","I applied for XXXX XXXX XXXX loan forgiveness per the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX settlement and am a full class member. I received a letter in XX/XX/2023 confirming that my loans will be discharged. As a full class member, I am expecting a refund for payments made to my loan servicers. However, my letter lacked mention of an amount to expect. I received a partial refund, but am unable to confirm if anymore is owed to me or how much. 

After the settlement deadline in 2023, EdFinancial, one of my loan servicers, had a prompt on their website about migrating to a new user portal and that users would need to create a new account on the new portal. Prior to this, I could log in and see my payment and loan history. However, after EdFinancial migrated systems, I was never notified to create a new account ( which their notice mentioned would happen ) and I have been unable to create a new account. I have emailed, chatted, and called support regarding this multiple times. My concerns are usually ignored and I have only been confirmed that my loans have been discharged. When I ask about viewing my account activity or history or ask about my refund, I have either been told to reach out to the Department of Educaton ( who has told me to reach out to EdFinancial ), I get the run around, or those concerns are completely ignored. 

Earlier this week, I called customer support again to ask about accessing this information. However, I was told I have no account with EdFinancial, suggesting I have no records to view. I asked the support person to email me what we discussed over the phone so that I could document our conversation and confirmation that I have no account, but was denied. The support person said they can not do that since I don't have an account. All I have are a couple of emails with support regarding my concerns to document my attempts to reach out for help. I don't have phone calls recorded or chat transcripts. 

My concern is with my ability to hold the Department of Education and/or the US Treasury and EdFincancial accountable to the refund I am owed per the XXXX XXXX XXXX settlement . Since I don't have access to this information, I don't know what or how much I am owed.","","EdFinancial Services","IL","60487","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-23,"In progress","Yes","N/A",8208853,2024

My next payment will be due before they can even look at this and correct it. They expect me to make payments on balances they incorrectly added to my loans.

Each time I request a response in writing, they require that I call and therefore I have no documentation to provide as evidence of what was communicated during these calls. 

In my twenties, I worked for numerous non-profits and a government agency because of a desire to serve others, and with the understanding that I could earn student loan forgiveness through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. I continue to be employed by the USDA ( NRCS ). 

I also served ( 3 ) terms with XXXX in XXXXXXXX XXXX and in XXXX. I made ( 2 ) lump sum payments toward my student loans. The first for a total of {$2400.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and the second for a total of {$1400.00} on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX These payments were made to XXXX and FedLoan Servicing, respectively. I was not employed by a qualifying employer at the time of the XXXX payment, but I used an award earned through XXXX service. MOHELA claimed it was not a valid payment because I was not working for a qualified employer at the time ( I was working two jobs that XXXX one part-time job at a public library and the other as a cook at a restaurant ). I explained that the award is issued after service is complete, and XXXX alums may not work for a qualifying employer at the time they receive the XXXX XXXX XXXX. They rejected this point of argument. 

The other payment I made while working for a qualified employer and making monthly payments. They did not count this lump sum payment and both the customer service representatives I spoke with and the ( 2 ) supervisors I spoke with did not understand how the XXXX XXXX XXXX lump sum payments were assessed. They claimed that because the payments were made to other loan servicers, they were not able to count those payments. 

In XXXXXXXX XXXX I requested a payment recount and escalation with MOHELA, but I'm not seeing any indication of that in the correspondence. I spoke with a supervisor about the escalation results on the phone sometime that summer. I attached two separate messages I sent ( """" PSLF Correspondence '' ) and the response I received was that I was asked to call MOHELA. I estimate I called MOHELA at least six times regarding this issue. They also rejected my XXXX XXXX XXXX documentation uploads ( they are listed as 'Canceled ' in my document tab ). 

Lastly, I have attached and highlighted a document from the Consumer Protection Bureau regarding XXXX lump sum counts. I strongly suspect that MOHELA does not count these, period, based on anecdotal evidence. I am also unable to see any of my past payments made to other loan servicers prior to MOHELA and believe this information should be available to all borrowers. 

Also, there is no direct statement about needing to be employed by an eligible employer at the time you make this XXXX XXXX XXXX payment. But that is how it has been interpreted by MOHELA, it seems. I had many frustrating calls with MOHELA about this. That said, they refuse to count my lump sum award ( s ) regardless. And, if this is the case that an XXXX XXXX needs to be employed by a qualified employer at the time they make the lump sum payment with the XXXX XXXX XXXX they receive after their term of service, my argument is that this is impractical and the rule should be revised or re-interpreted by issuing a national directive. It is not guaranteed that you will be employed by an eligible employer after you complete XXXX service and apply your XXXX XXXX XXXX to your student loans. 

I have since filed a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX and have written my Congressional delegate to request that my case is elevated or more closely examined. I have also filed several complaints with FSA regarding this matter and requested escalation to the Ombudsmans Group to resolve the issue.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","NH","03820","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-30,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8662218,2024

I was not able to get documentation from Great lakes about my payment history before the transfer, as I was unaware that this was happening. When I went to check my Greatlakes account after receiving the nelnet email, my great lakes account was gone. 

My number reflected XXXX on studentloans.gov before the transfer, and after, it jumped to the number that Nelnet added. Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have paid XXXX and my student loan is showing that my balance is {$47000.00}. None of this matches any of the documentation I have. On my credit report, it matches the correct original Great lakes number of XXXX that I had left in student loans. That number matches my first email from nelnet. 

Nelnet added to my student loans, gave my incomplete payment activity from Great lakes, and won't let me talk to anyone at Great Lakes because they said it was dissolved. I can't clearly see the payments I made to Great Lakes, even though I've been consistently paying on my loans since XXXX, 14 years now. 

Also, they won't provide any statements that show my incorrect starting balance with them. I can see the payments I made to Nelnet but I can't see how it affected the alleged balance with them. 

I should only have {$35000.00} left in my student loans. 

Furthermore, I got several notifications and documentation that my loans were """" paid in full '' but then it came back. A """" mistake '' like this is completely unacceptable. What Nelnet has done is add to my student loans, and provided false information on several accounts. I have talked to several other people who have had the same issue with nelnet adding to their loan balance, saying their account was paid in full, and then coming back. 

Also, I have a screenshot that said my last payment was {$7800.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, when I paid XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX. None of these numbers match up. 

I need my balance corrected, all my payment history provided to me in a clearer fashion, and statements from both nelnet and Greatlakes. For all I know, my student loan might actually be less than XXXX with all that I have paid. Please help, I'm in so much debt and have been paying consistently for years. 

Student loans.gov also says I took out more loans than I ever did after the transfer to nelnet. 

Nelnet took over Great Lakes, they have all this information. My student loan should actually be less than XXXX with all that I have paid. They added money to my principal which means I've been paying more interest than I owe.

As a result, I would not be able to pay, view my balance, or conduct any business with my loan online until it had """" transitioned '' to the new website. During this period my loan was to still accrue interest and a definitive date of """" transition '' was not listed. MOHELA said that I would likely regain access """" approximately XXXX weeks after XX/XX/XXXX ''. My loans fully """" transitioned '' on XX/XX/XXXX and showed no breakdown of interest and principal. Interest had clearly occurred but there was nothing showing exactly how much interest. 

Upon trying to pay on this new website, there was still nothing showing the amount of interest vs. principal, just one sum. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called to ask about this and was on the phone for two hours. The woman I spoke with did not resolve the situation and then hung up. She stated she would backdate the interest to before the transition period -- this did not happen. 

For two more days I waited to see if my loan details and breakdown would be fixed -- or if interest would be backdated. This did not occur. On XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment of {$10000.00} from a balance of ~ {$20000.00}. I received email confirmation and a confirmation number for this payment. Additionally, the MOHELA portal even displayed this payment as pending after being submitted. A picture of this is attached. Now, there is no record on the portal of such payment. 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I went to check my loans. The online portal has no record of a payment and my balance is now {$20000.00}. My payment was clearly not recognized and interest is still continuing to accrue rapidly. The funds for this payment left my bank account on XX/XX/XXXX. My payment received confirmation and the money has been transferred to MOHELA, but it is not reflected and interest is continuing to accrue as though a payment was never made. 

Despite multiple attempts to contact MOHELA I have received no help whatsoever. This certainly must be illegal and I am clearly losing money in an unfair fashion and spending countless hours attempting to rectify this manner. MOHELA is simply a reckless and unaccountable steward of FEDERAL LOANS.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","PA","19130","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-09,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8316067,2024

2024-02-11,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Struggling to repay your loan","Can't get other flexible options for repaying your loan","As soon as I realized that I was going to have to resume student loan payments I reached out to Mohela and the Federal Student loan companies. 
I explained my situation and they said I was not eligible for any of the programs, including forbearance, deferment or loan forgiveness. Mohela stated I had exhausted all. I explained that even though i had applied before and was granted in years past, we were on a 3 year forbearance due to covid given to us by our government. I also told them I was XXXX, but I needed to continue to work for as long as possible. I can not afford to quit. I have a lot of financial responsibilities. 

Thank you for taking the time to listen to my story. I was born in XXXX, XXXX. I came to the United States of America in XXXX with my wife, XXXX XXXX ( now XXXX ), and my brother-in-law, and mother-in-law. When I arrived, I didnt speak any English but was committed to learn. I worked during the day and took English classes at night at the local college. 

I found my first and only job at XXXX in XXXX where I have been for the last 34 years. Throughout my time in working, I learned the value of a college education firsthand. Unfortunately, in the years XXXX and XXXX, after years of hard work and dedication, I was passed up for a promotion I was well qualified for ( by my work experience ) because my competitor had a college degree. In one instance it was a degree in something completely unrelated to the job, but I saw how my employer favored those who were able to earn a degree from those who could not. From there on out I was determined to keep my children from reaching a similar fate. I could never afford college for myself. I had to work to keep my family afloat as their main breadwinner. My employer never has participated in any programs to help send employees to college either. 

XXXX is expensive. There are no two ways about it, and only those who are afforded the financial means to go are most likely to even apply. We recognized this as a country when we enacted The Higher Education Act of 1965, which widen the doors of equality so that anyone wanting to go to college could. Though we saw its last official update in XXXX today we read about several committees that have since been formed, as a part of this act, to address the many disparities that come along with affording a basic college education. 

Although there is great promise amongst some of the current committees forming to see through acts such as College Cost Reduction Act, and other related topics, we are still seeing many people struggle to pay back loan after loan. Consider how our very own current Presidential Biden-Harris administration student debt relief plan was blocked from forgiving up to a mere {$20000.00} in student debt. I know I am not alone out here on this limb. In theory when we take pen to paper we see a lot of awesome ideas, and great promise, but when it comes to getting these programs approved, we admittedly fall short. 

In XXXX is when I received the first disbursement for the parent PLUS loan. I was grateful for the option, because my XXXX freshly XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX were not able to get enough financial aid on their own to attend college, and my spouse and I could never put enough money away for their higher education. I co-supported myself, my wife, my children, my mother-in-law, and my brother-in-law. I thought that a parent PLUS loan, in combination with their concerted efforts to apply for aid, could serve its purpose in seeing to it that they got the education they would need to make it financially life. They would have the chance I never had, and who knew that they would grow up to be hard-working, law abiding, society contributing citizens. 

As it stands today, I owe a total of XXXX dollars with XXXX of that total coming from interest. This loan has grown erroneously over a span of 21 years. The original balance was XXXX, which is noted on my most recent statement from MOHELA dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

It is no secret that the cost of living has only grown substantially throughout the years, and I myself have been met with many medical-related issues since then, which are noted below. My last payment is dated in XXXX, which is when I was diagnosed with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I had a routine visit with my XXXX XXXX XXXX who had an XXXX performed and then sent me to the XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Before that in XXXX I suddenly went completely XXXX  in my right ear. I was at work and suddenly couldnt hear a thing out of the right side. It was scary to say the least, and turned into doctor visit after doctor visit, and XXXX after XXXX to finally put in a XXXX XXXX, which is the only way I could have continued working. In XXXX I became XXXX XXXX in my left ear, which again spurred doctor visit after doctor visit, and XXXX after XXXX. 

Today in XXXX I only have a chance at hearing if I have my XXXX XXXX activated. Without this device I am XXXX XXXX When I wear this device there are still several times where I have to ask people to repeat themselves, because I still dont hear like a person with normal working ears does. I can only hear XXXX voice at a time, and if there is any other noise interference going on I cant hear anyone, or anything. 

I have to keep the device charged, or it wont work. The charge does not even last an entire day so when it goes out it is like I am completely shut off from the entire world, and have to leave to recharge it. One thing I have to do is make sure it is charged every night so that it will be ready for work so there are many hours I am left without the ability to hear. 

I have had many bouts of crying. I fight XXXX and stress every day, which only exacerbates and complicates the diagnosis of XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have thoroughly considered filing for XXXX with the Social Security Administration, but I have to work.

I have not only always been a strong, hardworking man, but I also can not afford not to work. My doctor says he would like me to continue to work for my overall well-being, but now I am met with being asked by MOHELA to pay {$1800.00} a month with an income-driven repayment plan. I simply can not afford this and would lose my home. The current market for selling a home is not in my favor, because nobody is wanting to buy with such high interest rates. Renting would be likely be even more expensive than what I pay now for my monthly mortgage. Not to mention I love my home. 

I am a financially responsible person. I make payments on time and have good credit. I am a XXXX person ( a protected class ) who is advocating for myself in this situation. My wife and I have had several conversations with our current loan servicer to ask for lower payments, or to have this XXXX debt forgiven, and have been met with roadblock after roadblock. I have been told I am no longer eligible for forbearance and must be totally unable to make a living to qualify for loan forgiveness as a XXXX person. The Social Security Administration defines this as not being able to maintain a job with substantial gainful activity. 

I see many programs like the Public Service Loan forgiveness program, and teacher loan forgiveness program, but nothing for my line of work. I have been at this company for XXXX XXXX, and my dedication seems to account for nothing when being considered for student loan forgiveness. My job matters, too. I work at a fruit processing plant that contributes to many products our economy benefits greatly from, and is therefore its own form of public service to people who both buy and consume our products. 

I have contributed many years to volunteer work in my church as an usher, and group leader, and volunteered with the XXXX ( local youth soccer league ) from XXXX. ( By the way, yes, going deaf is what caused me to have to stop volunteering for the XXXX as you can imagine there are many noises that go on during soccer games, and this was a league where there were several soccer games going on at once, and therefore I could not hear ). 

There are currently no programs that recognize my work and volunteer history for loan forgiveness, so I am humbly asking for that opportunity in this letter, or a reasonable solution to this financial hardship I am experiencing with this XXXX loan. 

Those that came before us once said Divided we fall, united we stand. Please join me in being an advocate for those who are the working XXXX. Join me as an advocate for those parents who are left with college loan debt who have watched others before, and after be forgiven large amounts of student loan debt based on work classification, or from other backgrounds I dont fit in. There is no reason I can not be afforded the same opportunity I have watched my fellow-Americans reach in the forgiveness of their debts. 

I sincerely thank you for your time and look forward to hearing from you.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","OR","97058","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-12,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8325391,2024

2024-02-19,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","Hello, I have made numerous payments on Edfinancial portal, only to be notified of a payment reversal afterward. On multiple accounts, my payments have not gone through since XX/XX/XXXX. I have notified Edfinancial without any resolution of the issue. It is my goal to pay off my student loans as fast as possible and mitigate accrual of interest. 

I have reached out to Edfinancial via phone and email about these issues since XX/XX/XXXX. When speaking with a representative on the phone, I have been told that the issue would be explored. I have had this conversation 3 times without a solution or follow-up response. I sent an email in XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX months later, I received an email promising a follow-up email with a form to fill out to investigate this issue. I never received this form. The most recent phone conversation was XX/XX/XXXX informing me that there would be an account exploration. I was informed that I would hear a response within XXXX business days. Yet again, I never received a response. 

I checked with my bank, and this is not a banking issue. The problem is confusing because sometimes payments go through on Edfinancial, and sometimes, they do not. Since the beginning, Ive had my Edfinancial account linked to XXXX different bank accounts. With both accounts, the payments have not gone through. 

Im wanting to make XXXX types of payments : autopay and additional mid-month payments. I have been enrolled in autopay for multiple years. My autopayments have also not gone through since interest rates started reaccumulating in XX/XX/XXXX. Even though Im enrolled, Ive been notified of XXXX late payments. This issue is very frustrating. Im wanting to make timely payments with additional payments, but Im unable to do so. I was also told on XX/XX/XXXX that the autopay issue would be explored. 

In total, I have tried to pay {$26000.00} that has been reversed on Edfinancial website. This is {$26000.00} that has been accumulating additional interest since XX/XX/XXXX. 

Of these attempted payments, {$22000.00} was attempted to be paid before XX/XX/XXXX. Since then, {$22000.00} ( that I already tried to pay ) has been accruing interest at an average rate of XXXX XXXX 

Ive included a document with history of payments and subsequent payment reversals.","","EdFinancial Services","TX","752XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-19,"Untimely response","No","N/A",8378772,2024

Started receiving notices of late payment for this payment and called to inquire on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX EST and was on the call for 1 hour and 26 minutes. I was advised there was no record of the auto payment and to send proof of payment. Requested to speak with a supervisor and was advised I would need to receive a call back within 48 hours. No call was ever received. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, when I received notice of the next payment due of {$580.00}, I canceled the auto-payment and removed my bank account. I sent an email as instructed indicating that my bank statement showing proof of payment on XX/XX/XXXX had been uploaded via the Edfinancial secure site, and requested a call from a supervisor. Again, no call was ever received. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Edfinancial in response to my email inquiry as resolution to my pending request indicating their records show I called and was able to resolve my issue. I hadnt called ( this time ) and my issue was not resolved. I called to inquire about this email on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX  and was advised the support was received, is being researched and would take about 30 days but I would receive a response either way. 

I called again on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX EST and was advised the issue is not resolved and there is no estimated timeframe for research requests. When advised I was told 30 days I was advised that is not true. I again asked for a supervisor and was told it would need to be submitted and I would receive a call in 48 hours. I sent an email correspondence via the Edfinancial website requesting an immediate call from a supervisor. 

Tonight, at XXXXXXXX XXXX EST, I received a call which came through my cell as spam. It was not the Edfinancial number so I did not answer. This was apparently the supervisorI requested although the voicemail did not identify the individual as such. I returned the call at XXXX EST and spoke to a customer service representative who reviewed the account and indicated she was advised to request I submit proof of payment for research. I explained I had already done that in XXXX, had spoken to multiple people ( no supervisors ) since then and was waiting on resolution. I, again, asked for the supervisor and was told she would need to submit a request for call back in 48 hours. I advised I was returning a voicemail from literally 20 minutes earlier but she refused.

This student loan servicer is completely incompetent, mishandles payments, has zero customer service, rude reps and no escalation process. This is completely unacceptable.

Like many others, at the start of the pandemic I was told that I could continue to make regular payments during the XXXX  loan forbearance, so I did, in an effort to pay off my interest and start more quickly paying down my principal balance. I was never told that doing this would automatically put my account into a """" pay ahead status ''. When the forbearance ended this past Fall and payments resumed I saw that I somehow did not have a payment due until XXXX of XXXX and that the payment was for a much smaller amount than my typical required payment. They also changed the way my account works and no longer allowed me to make one lumpsome payment to be spread out across all of my loans and instead only allowed me to make individual payments for each loan which is incredibly confusing. At this time, I reached out to Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire. I did not hear back until XXXX after I sent a follow-up inquiry to find out why I hadn't heard from them after nearly two months. They then explained that my account was in pay ahead status and that they could remove that for me if I preferred. They ignored my question about the inconvenient payment structure. That same day I told them to please remove the pay ahead status and asked again for clarification on why I could no longer make one lumpsome payment. I then did not hear from them and reached out two more times for an update before getting confirmation that they would remove my pay ahead status on XX/XX/XXXX. They said it would """" take some time '' for the pay ahead status to show, I asked how long and still have not heard back and also asked once again about the payment method and why I could not make a lump-some payment as they continued to blatantly ignore that question. I have now followed up with them four times since XX/XX/XXXX asking when they pay ahead status would be removed and when I could expect to make lumpsome payment and haven't heard anything, despite the fact their website continues to indicate I should be hearing back in three days. I genuinely think this is predatory loan behavior and that they are trying to earn more in interest from borrowers. I paid off my interest completely during the XXXX loan forbearance and was working solely on the principal balance at this point. I think their automatically moving folks to pay ahead status without getting permission and seemingly purposefully ignoring my request to remove pay ahead status is an attempt to get additional interest to accrue on my account. If I kept the pay ahead status, hundreds if not thousands of dollars in interest could have accrued between last Fall and this Fall that would not have accrued if they had simply resumed payment and billing statements as I expected they would and as I have requested that they do.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","CT","064XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-08,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8311396,2024

I called back again and after 1 hour wait, was told I had to speak to an """" Advanced Agent, '' and was placed on yet another hold. After an additional 1 hour, I unfortunately had to go into work and was unable to wait the rest of the time for the call.

In XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed on my Mohela homepage that they said I needed to submit a IDR recertification by XX/XX/XXXX for a recertification deadline of XX/XX/XXXX. However, this is incorrect. According to XXXX, anyone with a recertification date prior to XX/XX/XXXX should have their recertification deadline pushed out by one year. You can see this at https : XXXX, under """" When do I have to recertify my IDR plan? """", where they state the following : """" The earliest you could be required to recertify is XX/XX/XXXX.

I also submitted a request to my local congresswoman for support, but have not yet received a response. 

My account has yet to be updated with the correct IDR recertification date. On my Mohela homepage, it currently says that I am overdue to recertify my IDR plan and that my next payment ( due XX/XX/XXXX ) will be on the standard payment plan rather than IDR, which is a dramatically higher payment. This directly contradicts the instructions from the federal government, as I outlined above, and also contradicts what I was told by a Mohela representative.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","OR","97229","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-26,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8420688,2024

2024-02-27,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","Mohela is ignoring the rules put out by the department of education and forcing me to recertify my income XXXX year earlier than what is required. My recertification date is listed as XX/XX/XXXX, which means I do not have to recertify my income until XX/XX/XXXX and am able to maintain my same payment amount. Because I did not recertify by their deadline, XX/XX/XXXX, they increased my payments from {$0.00} to more than {$2300.00}, with the first payment due XX/XX/XXXX. 
This is a direct contradiction to a written correspondence I received from them on XX/XX/XXXX stating my payments were {$0.00} and if my recertification date is listed as between now and XXXX XXXX, I can delay recertification by 1 year. My recertification date is XX/XX/XXXX. They sent me another letter XX/XX/XXXX stating I need to recertify by XX/XX/XXXX or my payments would increase to ~ {$2300.00}. I called Mohela and they told me I can ignore that letter, I was not due to recertify and that their systems are still catching up. 
I received the most recent notification on XX/XX/XXXX stating that because I didnt recertify my new payments are ~ {$2300.00}. They are using made up terms and rules such as first payment to justify what they are doing. They claim that because the first payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, this is after XX/XX/XXXX and I am ineligible for the extended recertification.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","NY","10128","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-27,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8422597,2024
2024-02-27,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Struggling to repay your loan","Problem with your payment plan","MOHELA 's repayment calculator is confusing and inconsistent. It is unclear what my total loan amount is and it is unclear what my loan amount is. 

Documents Received. On XXXX I spoke with MOHELA representative who was able to answer a limited amount of questions about my loan. Notably, they were unable to answer questions about accrual of interest or my account being updated. They assured me my account was updated. Following our conversation I attempted to recertify my income to enroll in the XXXX  program. However, I was unable to do this due to what appeared to be inconsistencies from MOHELA in my total loan amount and interest that was accruing. I decided to wait for the letter that the MOHELA representative assured me would be sent as they were not authorized to make any decision or modification on my account. 

On XXXX interest kept accruing on my account and I received no letter from MOHELA as indicated. This is incredibly frustrating because it has been impossible to self-certify my account. So I got my tax documents together and did the manual certification process. 

On XXXX I received another billing statement from MOHELA and no letter as expected per the XXXX phone conversation with their representative. Upon logging into MOHELA I see a black """" IDR '' document that is """" Processing '' on """" XXXX/XXXX/1014. '' This document is black. I did not submit this document and made no attempt to submit this document. This """" received date '' does not reflect either the XXXX or XXXX attempts. The XXXX attempt with my tax info is noted in the documents received attachment provided. 

On XXXX I moved forward with the XXXX  self-certification application in hopes this would result in my account being updated. However, the loan principle and amount indicated by MOHELA has been inconsistent in different places of my web portal. 

Repayment Calculator. Following a conversation with a MOHELA representative I attempted to update my income as instructed. However, the self loan recertification system is faulty and made it impossible to properly certify my loan amount. Notably, the system reflected that my """" Total MOHELA Balance as of XX/XX/2024 is {$170000.00} with the info bubble reflecting that this is my total loan balance including principle plus interest. MOHELA does not provide any ability to change this amount or note deficiency. However, this is inconsistent in other areas of MOHELA. Notably, a lower loan amount results in a higher monthly payment for me under the XXXX program according to MOHELA 's calculator in my specific situation ( $ 215 monthly vs $ 224 monthly ). 

My intention all along has been to change from my current ( previous? ) IDR plan to the XXXX program once interest begun accruing on my loan. I did not receive notification of interest beginning to accrue on my account and my account was not updated until after XXXX after interest began accruing on my account. It also appears there may be errors in my account that may unfairly and unjustly result in a higher monthly loan payment amount for me under the XXXX plan. 

I am being unfairly and unjustly scammed once again by MOHELA who began assessing interest on my loans without updating my account. There still appears to be serious errors in my account and the MOHELA online portal system. It is unjust and not right that MOHELA is assessing fees or recertifying loans at a higher rate than otherwise due.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","WI","548XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-27,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8422887,2024

As of XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from studentaid.gov saying that I missed a payment. I log in and check For some reason, Studentaid.gov says that I still owe {$20000.00}. I contacted Edfinancial on XX/XX/XXXX, over the phone to say why I still owe {$20000.00} when I paid off all my loans and interest back on XX/XX/XXXX, and the customer service representative said Edfinancial updated their system to a new one recently and dont have access to any receipts saying that I have paid them the {$27000.00}.

2024-02-26,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","There has been significant misinformation between the StudentAid.gov website as well as MOHELA, my loan servicer, affecting thousands if not more individuals including myself. 

Currently, there is information published on the Studentaid.gov website, stating that any loan income recertifications prior to XX/XX/XXXX will be pushed out one year from the recertification date. ( https : //studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19 ). My Federal Student Aid income recertification anniversary is XX/XX/XXXX, and it was XX/XX/XXXX on MOHELA website. They recently changed my date to XX/XX/XXXX. 

Currently, my payment has been {$470.00}, and on XX/XX/XXXX, my next pending payment for XXXX has increased to {$3300.00} and I have been placed into standard repayment, despite the above information stating I should not have to recertify my income until XXXX. 

I have spoken to MOHELA call center employees multiple times as my account information has not updated. Now I am being forced to recertify despite Federal Student Aid information as well as experience significant increases in loan payments. I have received conflicting data almost every time I have spoken to MOHELA. However, on two occasions, I also spoke with supervisors, and they assured me that my loan recertification date will be pushed to XXXX and my payment will stay the same. They advised to just keep watching the dates on the website. These dates of these conversations were XX/XX/XXXX as well as XX/XX/XXXX and yet still nothing has happened. I have also spoken with MOHELA again today, XX/XX/XXXX and they advised that because the system is not up to date, they will not honor the income recertification push back for any individuals. This is unfortunate that individuals have to suffer hardship and high loan repayments, simply because the MOHELA system is not correct or up to date. 

I have spoken with the FSA Ombudsman on XX/XX/XXXX, they also agreed that my loan recertification date should be pushed to XXXX per the FSA website and there is a current investigation pending # XXXX ( submitted XX/XX/XXXX ) and XXXX ( submitted XX/XX/XXXX ). I still have not received any information regarding these two submitted cases from the Federal Student Aid Department, despite being submitted 3 months ago. 

I believe this change is not correct and I have requested my payment and IDR plan to return to the XXXX and SAVE plan, with an IDR Anniversary date of XX/XX/XXXX, in accordance with the Federal Student Aid website.

2024-02-26,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","On XX/XX/2024, I logged into my EdFinancial account to check whether any action needed to be taken on my student loan. My account was in forbearance until XX/XX/2024 due to previous low income and the general forbearance provided to all student loans. 
When I logged in on the XXXX, I saw a notification on my account screen that said I had to recertify my income soon to stay on the IDR plan and that not doing so in time would cause my plan to change to another plan. I had logged in on my mobile phone and looked around the account page to understand the date by which I had to do this, but could not find any information on a due date. It was a Friday evening and the Edfinancial services customer support time had passed. Worried that this notification meant that I needed to do this right away to stay on the IDR plan, I submitted the application to recertify my income with my current income. The next day, I received a notification about a payment being posted on my account and saw that my account was taken out of forbearance because of the submitted income recertification. 
I then went online to other forums and understood that recertifying earlier took me out of forbearance. There was no indication that this would happen on the Edfinancial website, during the submission of the recertification, or anywhere in the portal for me to have foreseen this happening. My understanding was that this submission was required to keep my on the IDR plan beyond XX/XX/2024. 
I was extremely worried as I was not financially prepared to make these payments and so immediately sent an email to Edfinancial, but decided to make a call this morning. On making a call to Edfinancial, I was told that I should have done my research before submitting the application and that they can not revert the account status back to forbearance. I was told that my confusion has caused this and there was no way to resolve now and that I should have called in first before submitting the application. I asked how I could have found the information regarding when I needed to recertify and the gentleman told me that looking under 'Tools and Requests ' and clicking 'Printable Account Information ' would have shown me an account summary. This is not at all intuitive to someone trying to find account information- I had looked under 'Account Summary ', 'Loan Details ', 'Account History ', 'Repayment Options ' and the 'Inbox '. There is no record of the forbearance period on my account or in the printable account information I was directed to even today. All I see is that my forbearance period ends in 27 days and a payment is due. 
The online forums I ended up looking at directed me to file a complaint here to get this issue resolved as it seems to have happened to others as well. I saw a thread where the student was able to get it resolved with your help. So, please do help me out. I had it all planned out to start payments in XXXX. The incomplete and misguiding information on the account landing page with the warning message to recertify soon has led me to take these steps that have now put me in this very unfavorable position. Kindly help me as you have helped other students who faced the same issue.","","EdFinancial Services","MD","20850","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-26,"Untimely response","No","N/A",8420083,2024
2024-02-28,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","MOHELA is listing my payment due incorrectly and is not acknowledging federal guidelines. In XX/XX/2023, my loans were managed by XXXX and were ~ {$50.00}. My loans transferred in XXXX and all payment amounts since have been grossly incorrect. Initially I was quoted to pay more than {$4000.00}. My NSDLS file supported the payment amount of ~ {$50.00}. I was notified of this payment less than a week prior to needing to pay. Conversations revealed the payment would have to move forward regardless of action I would take. Request was made to return to the XXXX amount paid the month prior but was told that information would have to be retrieved from XXXX. Account was placed in forbearance but not before i was charged the {$4000.00} payment. The next communication I received was end of XXXX stating my payments were decreased to just over {$1700.00}. Conversations throughout XXXX did not provide information for how the new amount was determined. I was told the return to previous XXXX amount was still being considered during these conversations. It was not until XX/XX/XXXX that someone was able to escalate my request. I was not informed until end of XXXX after calling in several additional times that the request was denied XX/XX/XXXX because I apparently submitted an IDR renewal in XX/XX/2023 prior to transferring to Mohela. This application apparently confirmed the new amount of {$1700.00}. I never submitted that request and based on Studentaid.gov the last IDR application was submitted XXXX reporting a $ XXXX income which would generate a near $ XXXX payment for me on my existing PAYE payment plan given my household size.

2024-02-27,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","The short answer is that I paid off all of my Mohela loans in XX/XX/XXXX ( via a refinancing with XXXX ) with the exception of one loan - and the principal paydowns from that transaction have not been applied to the correct loans. I have made numerous phone calls to Mohela and sent numerous written communications via their online portal and have had no resolution in the five months since. Today is XX/XX/XXXX. The proper posting of the principal paydown would mean that all loans were left with a {$0.00} outstanding balance EXCEPT for XXXX # XXXX, because XXXX # XXXX had a below market rate of 5.41 % interest, so I wished to keep that debt with Mohela. 



To make matters worse, in the months of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I have been auto debited {$420.00} and {$410.00}, respectively. These numbers make absolutely no sense. My payment should be less than {$100.00} per month ( roughly {$9000.00} principal before these payments, 10 year amort schedule, 5.41 % interest ). Ideally, I would like to be refunded the overpayment. 



So three asks. 



( XXXX ) Please fix my loan balances, such that Loan 1 / 2 / and 4 reflect {$0.00} balances, and the only outstanding principal on my account remains at XXXX XXXX. 



( XXXX ) Id like to be refunded the overpayment portions of the XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payments that were auto debited from my bank account. 



( XXXX ) Id like to confirm that I have not been charged any incorrect interest since XX/XX/XXXX. Any interest charged to my account since XX/XX/XXXX should only be based on XXXX XXXX 5.41 % rate. The other loans on my account had higher interest rates, but their balances if treated properly should have been reduced to {$0.00}, so their interest rate should be moot and not be charged to any outstanding balance in my account. 



To review the series of messages that I've sent to Mohela via their online Messages function, see below. Many thanks in advance for any assistance you can provide. 



===== XX/XX/XXXX There seems to be some confusion about how the large payment ( ~ $ XXXX ) should be posted to my account. I say this because I have checked my Mohela balances on three ( 3 ) different occasions and seen different balances associated with difference loan numbers each time. Let me clarify how this should be done. All of my loans should now have a balance of {$0.00} with the lone exception of loan XXXX. Loan XXXX is the only loan that should still have any outstanding balance. Loans XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX should be the loans that receive their allocations of the recent ~ $ XXXX pay down. These loans were refinanced with XXXX. I did not include Loan XXXX in this refinancing because it is the XXXX loan in my portfolio of Mohela loans with an interest rate below the current market rate that I was able to obtain with XXXX. In the month prior to this refinancing, I paid off loans # XXXX and # XXXX from my own savings. I repeat. All payments from the recent large pay down should be applied to loan # XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. These loans should now have a {$0.00} balance outstanding. The only loan in Mohela account that should continue to have an outstanding loan balance is loan # XXXX, which has an interest rate of 5.41 %. Please confirm receipt of this message. Thank you. 



===== XX/XX/XXXX The {$9000.00} payment as of XX/XX/XXXX that was posted to XXXX # XXXX is INCORRECT. This amount should have been applied to XXXX # XXXX, NOT XXXX # XXXX. Allocating the payment correctly to XXXX # XXXX will bring the {$8500.00} balance that is currently being reflected to {$0.00}. Any $ amount that is left over after paying off XXXX # XXXX can then be applied to XXXX # XXXX. The only loan in my portfolio that should continue to have any outstanding balance is XXXX # XXXX. Please correct this issue as soon as possible. I have called multiple times without this issue being resolved so I'm attempting to contact via Messages. 

===== XX/XX/XXXX Why are my loan balances all wrong? My loan details are showing the following Current Principals : XXXX : $ XXXX, XXXX {$1900.00}, XXXX {$10.00}, XXXX {$19000.00}, XXXX $ XXXX. These are all incorrect. The aggregate of these balances is {$9100.00}. The correct record is very simple. The Current Principal for XXXX should be : {$9100.00}. Every other loan should reflect a Current Principal of {$0.00}. My account is also saying that my next payment due date is not until XX/XX/XXXX, which doesn't make any sense. I should be paying every month on XXXX 's {$9100.00} Current Principal. Please advise when I can expect the the system to be updated. Do not respond by saying that your records indicate that I have spoken to a representative and the matter is considered resolved. I have spoken to multiple representatives and the balances are still incorrect. This matter is NOT resolved. Please direct this message to someone who will correct the balances.

For example, if your account says your recertification date is XXXX XXXX, XXXX, that date will be pushed out to XXXX XXXX, XXXX.

However, I still do not have any information about my XXXX time IDR adjustment. I am currently on the SAVE plan. My principal balance was {$54000.00}. I have paid off {$30000.00}. According to https : //studentaid.gov/announcements-events/save-plan # benefits for loan amounts over {$26000.00}, each additional {$1000.00} is equal to an extra year of payments. I have paid off {$30000.00}. If I am not mistaken, this would qualify me for forgiveness for my graduate loans. I am just wanting to know if I do or do not qualify for forgiveness. I am looking for an IDR account adjustment. I am asking for help so I can be XXXX less customer for MOHELA to be forced to work with. I realize they are very understaffed, not properly funded and are overworked. I am looking for a simple answer of whether or not I am eligible for forgiveness.

I was told by the rep that it takes 6-8 weeks to process. The rep said I shouldve went online. So I applied through studentaid.gov fed loan servicing and they sent my application to Aidvantage. It shows completed on XXXX as of XX/XX/2023. On Aidvantage, it doesnt even show that I am in process for SAVE. It says awaiting paperwork but I dont file taxes and receive social security XXXX and dont have taxable income. Studentaid said I dont have to submit anything back in XX/XX/2023. Then Aidvantage sent me a bill this month and last saying I owe a full payment, due on XXXX XXXX. Aidvantage has sent ZERO communication about my SAVE application or forbearance. After searching for help online, Aidvantage is telling people they have to make a standard payment before they can be put on the SAVE program. This seems fraudulent for a student loan servicing company. I have hopefully been on administrative forbearance with no notification of it, for 4 months apparently, now they are sending bills with due dates as if I never even applied for SAVE. Their phone service is a joke, as you have to sit on hold so long the call sometimes drops. Then, when you get to someone, they tell you they are putting a note on your account about SAVE, but you never get ANY communication as to whether you even applied for it or where you are in the process.","","Maximus Education, LLC dba Aidvantage","MI","499XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-12,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8325353,2024

2024-02-17,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","My student loan provider is EdFinancial Services and I have three issues with them. 

1. They turned off my auto-pay without telling me which resulted in a late payment 2. When I made a manual payment, they took out the payment twice instead of just once and told me it will take up to two months to refund their mistake. 
3. They applied my payment to one of my two consolidated loans, instead of evenly applying it to the two loans, and now are showing me as delinquent on one of the loans because of their mistake. 

I called the student loan provider in early XXXX to point out the double-debit from my bank account. They submitted the work order on either XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX for that issue. When I got my next statement it noted a delinquency on one of my two loans, which I discovered was due to a mis-application of my payment. I called about this issue and they submitted a second work order on XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX. Separately, on XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a complaint through the ombudsman website at the Department of Education 's office of Federal Student Aid. I've called both for more information, but neither has any updates and have said they have nobody they can transfer me to for any kind of update. They said I just have to wait until someone reaches out to me. 

To clarify the 3 issues I'm dealing with : I applied for the SAVE program last fall before student loan repayments restarted. When my repayment restarted I was not in the SAVE program yet. I had the auto-pay turned on. I was approved for the SAVE program on XX/XX/XXXX. This led to issue # 1. Once I was approved for the SAVE program they turned off my auto-pay and didn't inform me until they sent me my next billing notice and informed me that I was past due on my XXXX payment. My auto-pay had been set to the XXXX of each month and I got the notice on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I started making manual payments while waiting for my auto-pay to restart ( it's restarting this month on XX/XX/XXXX ) and this led to issue # 2. I submitted a manual payment for XXXX from my bank account and they deducted it twice from my bank account. I called them and they said they would submit the work order for it, and that it would take 30-60 days to refund my money. I asked if they could transfer me to someone in finance and they said there was nobody I could speak to. I called back on Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX  and asked to speak to any kind of supervisor and was told they would call me back the same day. They called back Friday evening at XXXX and left a message indicating I had to wait until Monday to call back. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received my latest bill that would receive the XXXX XXXX auto-pay and this led to issue # 3. The bill said my account was past due. I have two separate loans that have been consolidated together and my monthly payment is split between the two loans. They took my double payment and applied it entirely to one of the two loans, rather than splitting it between them. So, one loan is showing up as unpaid for last month and I've been getting notes that I'm past due on that loan. I called EdFinancial about that and they submitted the other work order. Late last week I got another notice saying I was 11 days delinquent. It's not an issue yet given the Biden plan allowing for no payment for up to a year, but if it's happening now, I worry about what happens if they mess up a year from now and my credit score takes a hit.","","EdFinancial Services","DC","20009","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-17,"Untimely response","No","N/A",8363759,2024

There were many processing errors and conflicting pieces of information coming in daily from the servicer, and each day, my account would reflect new and often incorrect information. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was in a mandated forbearance from the XXXX administration, and checked my online MOHELA account to see the details of when that would end. While there, I saw my account stated I would owe a monthly payment amount of {$600.00} on the XXXX plan, which was an incorrect calculation based on my income. The amount was due on XX/XX/XXXX, yet my forbearance was said to end XX/XX/XXXX. Why would be forced to pay during a forbearance? 

When I checked the next day on XX/XX/XXXX, the account showed I needed to pay {$600.00} by XX/XX/XXXX now. My forbearance status was gone, my monthly payment amount was incorrect and unaffordable to me, and I was told I would need to pay in XXXX calendar days. I called that day, requesting to have my monthly payments recalculated, and in the meantime, they said they would apply a general forbearance because I was unable to pay. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my account reflected a correct SAVE amount, and I called MOHELA and asked them to remove my general forbearance, that I was ready to pay. I was told it would take at most XXXX business days to remove the general forbearance, which would be XX/XX/XXXX.

You are not required to make a payment until XX/XX/XXXX and your account will not be considered delinquent. Be on the lookout for your next billing statement.

2024-01-09,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I am low income and applied for the newly introduced Saving on a Valuable Education ( SAVE ) Plan. I was deemed eligible with a predicted monthly payment of {$0.00} ( I make approximately {$13000.00} a year which according to SAVE means I will have no monthly payment or interest while my income is below {$32000.00} ). My application was processed and accepted and I was told that my eligible loans were places on an income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plan on XX/XX/XXXX. 

However on XX/XX/XXXX I received a Billing Statement stating I owe {$650.00}. Thinking it was still processing and would update soon, I waited a few day, but didn't get an updated statement. So I went to look at my loan details and the SAVE plan was only applied to XXXX of my XXXX eligible loans. I called immediately and was connected to a Mohela rep named XXXX at about XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX. 

She told me she had no idea why the SAVE plan was only applied to 4 of 10 loans and that it should have been applied to all 10 Federal loans because they all were eligible and there was no error on my end.

Even though the SAVE plan should have been applied to all loans, she did not have a way of fixing this herself, so her solution was to have me reapply for the SAVE program over the phone. As for the currently due payment, she suggested putting the loan in Forbearance. 

The biggest issue with this is that I am now accruing daily interest while I wait for them to fix their error. Since XX/XX/XXXX, I currently have over {$70.00} of interest accrued and it goes up daily, when had the plan been applied appropriately and correctly the first time, there would be no interest. 

I just received a notice from Mohela titled """" Correspondence Processing Delay '' which states it may take up to 90 days to process my request. This is another 90 days of interest that I was never supposed to accrue all because of a technical error on their part. 

It feels really unethical to first incorrectly apply this Federal SAVE program, send me a bill for loans I should not owe anything on, and now charge me interest daily while they take an unreasonable amount of time to solve the issue. And reading online, it seems many others have had this issue.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","MD","21218","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-09,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8136467,2024

I have had no issues with any loan services prior to MOHELA. I worked for the government so I am on an income driven repayment and have been on this since graduation. Every year I recertify my income, get new payment amount and pay accordingly. This changed with MOHELA. On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted my application for the SAVE program and recertified my income for the post-pause IDR plan. they failed to process either and unilaterally switched all my loans to a level payment plan without my authorization and with no communication they were going to do so. The level payment was over $ XXXXmonth. I have called twice in XX/XX/XXXX, again in XX/XX/XXXX, 3 times in XXXX and every week beginning XX/XX/XXXX. MOHELA has failed to place all 9 of my direct loans in administrative forbearance while they find the staff and/or resources to process the SAVE application. Each call is an unreasonable hold time for anyone with a job ( averaging over 50 mins per call ). Each call is a statement apologizing for the delay and saying my only option is to suspend auto-debit and lose interest rate reductions while they sit on the unprocessed application. The most recent call on XX/XX/XXXX the agent indicated she was suspending the auto debit against my express direction not to do so. They can not provide any explanation for why all loans are not in forbearance and actually had two of the loans miscarried as a Parent Plus Loan until a supervisor reviewed the promissory note to confirm it is in fact a XXXX XXXX loan that should have been placed in forbearance with all others. The request to fix their error had not been corrected and they continue to take payments for loans that should be in forbearance until they process the application. They have failed to respond to electronic messages via their secure portal expect for boilerplate responses indicating we see youve called customer service and will assume this issue is resolved. They denied my authorization to provide information for a complaint I filed with the XXXX. When you ask to speak with a supervisor they either hang up on you or transfer you to a mailbox to leave a message but a supervisor never returns the message. I just want to determine the accurate monthly payment under the SAVE program ( which the federal loan simulator can do in real time! ) and resume making my payments to count towards the 25 years of on time payments and MOHELA is preventing this. If I had known the SAVE application would have triggered this I would have never applied for it and just stayed on the IDR plan. As far as I am concerned the SAVE program and MOHELAs failure to admit applicants into the program is a scam. The increases in interest on the loans for the 5 months of processing benefits no one expect MOHELA. I need help! I have tried everything short of filing a lawsuit against them.

They were not well off but also didnt give me a XXXX for or during my XXXX years of attendance. The last 15 years have been trying to figure out how to pay off XXXX in student loan debt while trying to establish myself as an adult. That burden has been awful. My private loans are with XXXX and public with XXXX. My last payment to XXXX was for the full amount of {$570.00}. Of that amount, {$.00} was applied to the principal. Of the 6 different group loan types, one has an interest rate of 11.08 %. I have XXXX payments, XXXX years, remaining to pay off this debt. 

My degree is in XXXX XXXX. I thought I would go to law school, but understandably, did not think the debt was worth the degree. My first degree was not worth the investment. I cant return my degree. Ive tried. 

In order to pay my normal bills with little discretionary income left, I can not afford my college loans. I wouldnt have gone to college if I knew the payments would be this high. But I didnt know. How is this legal? Why can financial institutions take advantage of children like this when they believe they think they are doing something positive for their futures? This is wrong and insidious. I made the choice to go to school when I was XXXX XXXX XXXX. Now Im being charged 11 % on variable rate loan when Im one month away from being XXXX. My only option is to default. Deferment or forbearance options are depleted. Im tired and just want to raise my XXXX XXXX year old son.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","Vermont Student Assistance Corporation","NY","12208","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-19,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8549906,2024

2024-03-06,"Student loan","Private student loan","Struggling to repay your loan","Can't temporarily delay making payments","This is a complaint against XXXX and XXXX XXXX. 

I have requested a deferment, from XXXX, under the XXXX XXXX agreement that still governs my loan terms. 

However, XXXX will not grant me a deferment and now, not only has my credit score dropped from XXXX to under XXXX, but I am stressed because the monthly loan amount of {$800.00} ( only for 6 months then goes up to over {$1000.00} then back to {$1600.00} ) is a great hardship and I am barely able to keep up with my other financial obligations. 

I have not passed the bar which would put me in a difference income bracket to pay back this loan but right now I'm not there yet and do not have the sufficient income to pay this loan. 

I have been making payments but they have been small and XXXX stated that the payments are not enough and I will be put in default. If that is the case, then it could affect my career as an attorney when I do pass the bar. 

I'm asking for a deferment which is allowed under the XXXX XXXX agreement and which governs the loan terms. XXXX can not point to anywhere in my agreement where requesting deferments is limited. 

In XXXX, I contacted XXXX XXXX and inquired into consolidating my loans, I was told if I consolidated my loans at that time, it would put me in re-payments status. I was then told by a XXXX XXXX representative that when I graduated and my loans become due, I could then consolidate my loan. 

In XXXX XXXX I learned that XXXX XXXX was exiting the Student Loan business and was selling all of its student loans to other companies. I contacted XXXX XXXX and requested to consolidate my loan. I was told that it was too late and I missed the deadline. I told XXXX XXXX that I never received any notice. XXXX XXXX confirmed that they had an incorrect address for me but that it was still too late since the transfer was taking place in a few months but that the same terms apply and I could consolidate with the loan servicer once my loan was transferred. 

From XXXX to XXXX, I was granted XXXX deferments. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I requested another deferment for a few more months but was told I couldnt have XXXX. I told the representative that I wasnt aware there was a limit and that nowhere in the XXXX XXXX XXXX there was any clause on the number of deferments I could request. This is the first time I was told there was a limit to deferments but I couldnt find it anywhere in the XXXX XXXX agreement which governs my loans. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX and spoke to XXXX. She confirmed that the student loans I have with XXXX XXXX were still governed by XXXX XXXX and not XXXX, since XXXX was only XXXX XXXX XXXX. Also, this is the first time Im told that XXXX can create its own guidelines and they are limiting the forbearances and deferments. However, I did not agree to this my XXXX XXXX agreements before transfer stated that XXXX XXXX will govern the loan even after transfer and there is nowhere in the agreement that states deferments are limited. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX and again requested a forbearance and/or deferment. I was told by the representative that I am no longer eligible for any since I only had XXXX. I told the representative that the XXXX XXXX agreement which still governs my loan, does not state the number of times I can receive a forbearance and/or deferment. Further, I cant afford the {$800.00} a month modified amount. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from a XXXX representative who told me I was behind in payment. I told the representative thats because XXXX will not work with me and my XXXX XXXX is dropping. She was understanding but she couldnt help me with another deferment. I told her I pay what I can but I am not making the money I should be to pay back the loan because I havent passed the bar yet. 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX called a few times and told me I was behind in payment and I told the representative that I really need a deferment but she told me that I have exhausted all of them. I told her that my XXXX XXXX agreement does not state the limit and that I am really in need of a deferment. By the way, my credit scored dropped from XXXX to around XXXX. 

In XXXX, I called XXXX a few times to again request an additional deferment. I have been making small payments but I cant catch up. Im told again that I cant get a deferment event though my XXXX XXXX agreement does not limit me to deferments. My credit score has dropped below XXXX. 

In XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I received several phone calls from XXXX and I have called them to try to negotiate a deferment or lower my payments. Most of representatives understood but I was told XXXX cant get a deferment. Also, a representative again stated that XXXX can create their own guidelines and that is probably whey I am not eligible for any deferments. 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to a XXXX representative who told me that there are no more deferrals or forbearances to use for the life of the loan. I reminded him that the XXXX XXXX agreements governs the loan, as specified in the notice transferring the loans to XXXX, and that there was no way of me knowing that I was limited on the amount of deferrals because it does not state in the XXXX XXXX agreement. I also told him that my credit went from a near XXXX to a below XXXX in less than 5 months because they reported late payments to the credit bureaus. I also let him know that paying my loans would have been no problem had I passed the bar but since I havent I cant afford the {$800.00} a month modified loan payment ( the monthly loan payment is {$1600.00} and will jump back up to over {$1000.00} and then back to the {$1600.00} after that 6 month period ). I told him that it was not fair that I can not get another deferment especially since its provided for in my XXXX XXXX agreement and that the XXXX XXXX agreement still governs my loan. On a side note, he also said that XXXX XXXX does not own my loan but a bunch of investors. This is in conflict with what previous XXXX and XXXX XXXX representatives relayed to me. My credit score is now below XXXX. 

FROM THE XXXX XXXX XXXX ( THERE IS NO LIMIT ON DEFERMENTS ) : D. TERMS OF REPAYMENT 4. Deferral/Extension and Other Repayment Modifications ( a ) Alternative Repayment Term You may from time to time, at your discretion, offer alternative repayment options on this loan. Any Cosigner under this Credit Agreement agrees that you may permit the Student Borrower to select any such alternative option without notice to, or consent from the Cosigner, and that such selection shall not release the Cosigner from his/her obligations under this Credit Agreement.

( b ) Deferral You may, at your absolute discretion, grant a deferral/extension which will suspend principal and/or interest payments during a short-term hardship period pertaining to the Student Borrower. I understand that ( i ) during a deferral/extension period, interest will continue to accrue and I will remain responsible for paying such interest, and ( ii ) unpaid interest that accrued during my deferral/extension period will be capitalized ( see Section C.4 ). If I have multiple education loans you hold, I understand and agree that ( i ) you may, in your sole discretion and without notice to me, apply an administrative deferral to align the payment due dates of all such loans when they enter repayment ( ii ) during this deferral period, interest will continue to accrue on the loans included in the deferral and I will remain responsible for paying such interest, and ( iii ) unpaid interest will be capitalized ( see Section C.4 ). Any Cosigner of this credit Agreement agrees that ( i ) any in-school deferral/extension will be based on the enrollment status of the Student Borrower, and ( ii ) the Student Borrower may agree to any deferral or other modification of the repayment schedule and that such agreement will not release the Cosigner form his/her obligation under this Credit Agreement.

C. INTEREST ( Section C.4 ) 4. Capitalization I understand that you will add all accrued and unpaid interest to the Final Loan Amount ( capitalized interest ) on the last day of the Interim Period and at the end of any deferral/extension period. In all cases, the sum is thereafter considered the Final Loan Amount, and interest will accrue on this new Final Loan Amount. 
F. LATE PAYMENT AND OTHER CHARGES 1. I will pay a late charge of {$28.00} if I fail to make any part of an installment payment within 10 days after it becomes due. I will pay only one late fee for any payment, regardless of the number of days late.","","Nelnet, Inc.","CA","XXXXX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-08,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8489608,2024

2024-02-21,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Problem with customer service","Today SAVE loans are being forgiven, and mine should be included, but MOHELA has delayed processing of my SAVE loan payment plan. I am also still waiting for a refund from the payment I made in XXXX, XXXX. I thought I was enrolling into SAVE when payments first resumed. I was told I didn't qualify for the plan I applied for due to income, and MOHELA then defaulted to a level repayment which is unacceptable for PSLF individuals like myself. Just one of the many, many incompetent moves on the part of MOHELA. Then I enrolled in a different IDR plan. This took months to go through. I was one of the people that never received a billing statement, but I paid and I am still waiting for a refund of that XX/XX/2023 payment. I had assumed it would just be credited to my account for a future payment but it was not. When I recently called them, they admitted I should be refunded or credited -- it does not appear they were going to do either unless and until I called. Now I found out there are NOT income caps on the SAVE plan, so I don't know why I was originally told I did not qualify. 

Because my loan should be in the group forgiven today- will I be refunded for my XXXX and future payments once MOHELA finally finishes updating my payment plan? Why is this taking so long when the proces should be automated and MOHELA had years to prepare for loans resuming? 

I never reached an employee that is not 'in training '. MOHELA keeps saying this is unprecedented, but again- they had years to prepare and were pushing for payments to resume sooner, so the company should have been overstaffed and completely prepared. Looks like they did just the opposite. It also appears MOHELA is taking on more loans, even though they are not properly servicing the loans they current hold. This is outrageous. 

1 ) When will my payment plan be updated and why is this taking so long? It shouldn't take multiple months. Will I be refunded for future payments because MOHELA 's delay is going to prevent my loan from being forgiven in this first batch of SAVE loans forgiven. The delay is clearly intentional. 

2 ) when will I receive my refund for the XX/XX/2023 payment Mohela still has not refunded or credited? 

MOHELA was going to keep my XXXX payment until I recently asked for it back. Why? Incompetence or greed? Please explain. These delays are earning MOHELA a lot of money, especially as it appears the company intends to keep money that is not owed unless the consumer realizes the company was supposed to give it back and asks for it. I am still waiting to find out if I will ever get that. 

MOHELA is clearly delaying on purpose for the purpose of increasing profits on the interest earned on money that isn't theirs. Leaving me a couple of remaining questions, this time for the federal government ; why was MOHELA awarded more contracts when it is completely mishandling the contracts it is currently servicing? I do want an answer to this. Why is it all MOHELA? There's no incentive for the company to improve and start managing things correctly when they have been given ALL the contracts and there is XXXX competition. Finally, which government officials own interests in MOHELA?

I believe that Moehla has failed to accurately apply and report my payments, causing significant financial and personal distress. 

I have an account with Moehla. Over the course of my loan repayment, I have paid over {$12000.00}, as evidenced by bank receipts and transaction histories. However, following the transfer of my loan servicing to Moehla in 2020, these payments have not been reflected accurately on my account. This error has led to an inflated principal balance, increased monthly payments, and a rise in my interest rate. 

Despite multiple attempts to resolve this issue through phone calls and submitting proof of my payments, Moehla has not provided any response or resolution. The lack of acknowledgement and action from Moehla 's side has compounded the problem, leaving me in a financially precarious position and causing undue stress.

I am hereby requesting the CFPB 's intervention in this matter. I am seeking the CFPB 's assistance in ensuring that my payments are correctly applied to my account, my account balance is adjusted, and my interest rates and monthly payments are returned to their proper amounts. 

I trust that the CFPB will understand the severity of this issue and take appropriate action to rectify the situation. I am available for any further information or clarification needed in this regard. 

Thank you for your attention to this critical matter. I look forward to a prompt and fair resolution.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","CA","90802","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-11,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8145607,2024

I don't want to place blame on Mohela solely because this has to do with the Department of Education as well. I have found many helpful reps at mohela but at times many inaccuracies. 
I received a letter today XX/XX/year>, dated XX/XX/year> my account was placed in an mandatory administrative forbearance, due to my yearly IDR renewal. 
I renew my plan XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, approved XX/XX/year> and scheduled to begging on XX/XX/year>. 
I had a bill for XX/XX/year> ready to be paid, once I was placed on this administrative forbearance due to processing IDR my due bill disappeared. I can't make any payments and is too late to generate a bill. 
Once I called, I spoke to a supervisor who stated this forbearance will count for XXXX once the Department of Education applies the XXXX review. 
The Department of Education states is Mohela that needs to apply the forbearances. 
I called today, just to see what response I got and was told, she didn't know. She couldn't say if it was going to be applied for XXXX or XXXX. Could not give me a straight answer, and I can't even pay because there is no bill. I mean come on!! we are trying here. Please help us. Attached is the letter received and the bill with no payments due for XXXX. 
Also attached are picture of the new XXXX rules, were it states mandatory forberances placed by servicer count for XXXX. It should be stated in your website.

Issue 1 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a payment of {$1000.00} towards my student loans. Mohela incorrectly applied the payment as follows : {$270.00} towards loan # 1, {$340.00} towards loan # 2, and {$370.00} towards loan # 3. The minimum payment for loan # 2 was {$180.00} and the minimum payment for loan # 3 was {$200.00}. Please see the attached with my current payment history. 

Mohela incorrectly shorted loan # 1 by {$320.00} resulting in more interest being charged against me since that loan has a higher interest rate. 

I contacted Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX with the following message : """" I read through your website and you indicate that payments made over the required amount will be applied to the loan with the highest interest rate. This month, I made a payment on XXXX and I paid extra towards the loan. You did not apply the extra amount towards the loan with the highest interest rate, you applied it proportionally against all 3 of my loans. Please correct this error and apply my extra payment amount towards the loan with the highest interest rate. '' Mohela responded on XX/XX/XXXX with the following : """" Thank you for contacting MOHELA, Once your accrued interest has been satisfied with your payment, any additional amount that is above your regular monthly payment amount will be applied to the principal balance of your loans and future payments. If you have satisfied your future payment, your next billing statement will indicate a payment is not required for that bill. You may still continue to make payments which will pay your account ahead. Since the extra payment goes towards principal balance, you end up paying less interest over the life of the loan and pay your loans off quicker. 

If you have any additional questions, please contact us toll free at XXXX. Our hours are Monday XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX., Tuesday and Wednesday XXXX XXXX. to XXXX XXXX., Thursday and Friday XXXX XXXX. to XXXX XXXX. CT. 

Thank you, MOHELA '' Their response seems to indicate to me that they did not accurately read my initial message because they completely missed the purpose of my message and did not address the concern I raised with them. 

Issue 2 ) I had auto pay set up with Mohela and had several months of no issues with payments being withdrawn. For some reason, Mohela did not process my auto withdrawal for my XX/XX/XXXX payment. This resulted in me not making a payment until XX/XX/XXXX when I was notified that they did not withdraw my payment. They let me know that my payment was late. I had sufficient funds to pay make my payment and the failure to withdraw the funds was on Mohela 's end. 

I called Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX to find out what happened and they could not tell me why they did not withdraw my payment but that it would be working effective XX/XX/XXXX. They refused to credit my account for the 3 days of interest that accrued during the time that they did not take my payment. 

I also addressed the issue with the {$1000.00} payment from issue 1 and they could not tell me why there was a discrepancy between their policy and their actions. They informed me that when payments are made in excess of the minimum amount, they distribute it proportionally amongst the loans. This call was recorded by Mohela and directly contradicts their policy listed on their website. 

They indicated that they could not recalculate the interest from my first {$1000.00} payment and that I would have to make additional payments in the future to target that loan if I wanted payments applied to that loan. 

Issue 3 ) I have recently been trying to pay off loan # 1 since it has the highest interest rate. I have been making payments to target the loan. 

My most recent payment was on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$550.00}. The minimum payments for the loans remain the same and {$550.00} is the minimum amount I owe every month. Mohela once again applied the payment incorrectly towards this loan in a very noticeable an egregious way. Despite the minimum payment on loan # 1 being {$150.00}, Mohela only applied {$31.00} of the {$550.00} payment towards loan # 1.

I have not contacted Mohela regarding issue 3 because they have demonstrated to me in issues 1 and 2 that they will not do anything to remedy this mistake which violates their policy. 

To me their actions indicate that they will brake their policy and incorrectly apply payments to loans with lower interest rates in order to generate more money on interest than if they followed their policy and applied payments towards the loans with the highest interest rate first. At this point, Mohela 's actions are causing me to pay more on my student loan payments than I should have to pay.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","AZ","85212","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-12,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8332860,2024

2024-04-01,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","On XX/XX/XXXX I logged into both my studentaid.gov and Mohela accounts to check my loans. It was at this time I realized I had forgotten to make my XX/XX/XXXX payment. I noticed that Mohela had sent me a delinquency notice on XX/XX/XXXX and that I had a payment past due of {$0.00} and a next payment due amount of {$0.00}. I looked in my messages and I see nothing new except a friendly payment reminder, a student loan interest statement ( both sent XX/XX/XXXX ) and a student loan billing statement ( sent XX/XX/XXXX ). So I check my received documents page and that is when I saw that my IDR that I submitted in XXXX ( received by Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX ) was cancelled. I went to my studentaid.gov page and found nothing new anywhere on my page. I was able to locate in my activity where I submitted an IDR request for plan change on XX/XX/XXXX and my most recent submission on XX/XX/XXXX for IDR recalculation, both of which said they were processed and that my servicer would choose my plan. I checked my emails and had nothing from either site regarding forbearance or my IDR application. I called Mohela at XXXX ( XXXX ) and was on the call for 1 hour 15 minutes and 49 seconds, during which I was informed that my income based repayment plan was recertified and that after my forbearance ends on XX/XX/XXXX I will have a payment of {$0.00} until XX/XX/XXXX. I inquired about the forbearance and I was informed that it was started after I missed my payment and is a delinquent forbearance and was used to make my account current again. I asked if my forbearance will count towards PSLF, I was told no. I asked if I make my payments during forbearance if those will count, I was also told no. I then inquired about removing the forbearance and when she returned from the hold she told me that my payment for XX/XX/XXXX would be over {$1000.00}, I asked where that number came from and she told me it was because my IDR had lapsed and I hadn't recertified in time. She then said if she kept the forbearance for XXXX, my XXXX payment would be {$460.00}. She told me that my {$0.00} payments don't begin until XXXX and that I would owe those amounts if I removed the forbearance... all because Mohela DID NOT PROCESS MY IDR REQUESTS. I have submitted multiple complaints to studentaid.gov about dealing with this servicer, my last one being from XX/XX/XXXX regarding the lack of movement in processing my IDR ( that complaint hasn't been processed yet ). I have called Mohela and emailed them since XXXX, to no avail. So here I am, stuck losing 2 months of payment history because of their failure to process my paperwork accordingly. I am also livid over the fact that I was told my payment for XXXX would be over {$1000.00} when I have the XXXX billing statement that shows it was only {$230.00} ( this shows {$460.00} because it was generated the same day as my payment was posted ), same for XXXX ( this does show {$460.00} because it accounts for the missed XXXX payment, which I take accountability for ). I am also not trusting that my new payments are actually {$0.00} as I have not received any documentation regarding the IDR plan. 
The sheer lack of ability to process paperwork is astounding to me when you have so many people that are trying to take care of the debt that they owe. I don't know how much more I am supposed to do, when I reach out to studentaid.gov and Mohela and it take MONTHS upon MONTHS to get any response and by then the issues are no longer valid and the point is moot. I think the government needs to reconsider giving Mohela all of the loans to process, they clearly can not handle the volume and we, as student loan customers, are bearing the brunt of it.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","MI","492XX","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2024-04-01,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8671645,2024

Specifically, you can buy back months that dont count as qualifying payments because you were in an ineligible deferment or forbearance status. 

You can buy back these months only if you still have an outstanding balance on your loan ( s ), you have approved qualifying employment for these same months, and buying back these months will complete your total of 120 qualifying PSLF payments. 

I meet all the above criteria. I have an outstanding balance on my loans. I have 113 qualifying months for PSLF. I have approved qualifying employment during the seven months I am requesting to buy back : XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX ; and XX/XX/XXXX.

Mohela messed up my employment history which is impacting my qualification for three payment programs I'm supposed to be on ( the income driven replayment plan and PSLF plan I've been on for almost 6 years, and the SAVE plan which I just applied for in fall XXXX  ). I've submitted the necessary paperwork - the employment verification form - each year. However, a recent document they sent me shows several incorrect fragmentations in my work history. The most recent inaccuracy shows that I stopped working for a qualifed public agency around XX/XX/2023. This is incorrect as I still work for the state. It is also driving up my monthly payment from {$180.00} to over {$1200.00}! 

2. I signed up for auto student loan payments on Mohela 's website in the amount of {$180.00} per month several months ago because they state they will provide a 0.25 % discount. In the first week of XXXX they did the auto pay for {$1400.00}! It cleared out half of my account. Thankfully my credit union recalled the charges.

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX announced that part of the CARES ACT would include a nation-wide pause ( Administrative Forbearance ) on all federal student loans. This was made retroactive to XX/XX/XXXX. 

During the XXXX Emergency Relief Act federal student loans were paused and payments were not required, interest rates were set at 0 %, income re-certifications to calculate income-driven payment ( XXXX ) plans were not required, and these administrative forbearance months all counted towards XXXX and XXXX forgiveness XXXX If student loan borrowers had made payments accidentally during this pause, they could request refunds from their student loan borrowers several years after the fact. 
In XXXX of XXXX my student loans were being serviced by XXXX and I was in an Income Driven Repayment Plan ( XXXX ) known as Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ). I had been on the XXXX plan since XXXX of XXXX. Part of being in an IDR requires that you recertify your income annually to recalculate your monthly payment based upon your income. While on XXXX if your income increases to a point where you no longer meet partial financial hardship or if you fail to recertify your income before the annual plan anniversary, your payment increases to the standard payment plan amount based on the amount owed by the borrower when they first entered XXXX ( XXXX for me ). Student loan servicers take anywhere between XXXX to XXXX weeks to process an income recertification application and so they instruct their student loan borrowers to send in their income recertifications well before the annual plan anniversary. My annual payment plan anniversary is on XX/XX/XXXX. And XX/XX/XXXX would be the first new monthly payment calculated upon my most recent income tax return. I have attached a letter from XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX indicating that my payment plan would be $ XXXX and would be active from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. This indicates that I still had partial financial hardship when the pause began on XX/XX/XXXX and that I had XXXX remaining payments of {$590.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. This is important, because ultimately XXXX would instruct student loan borrowers and companies that when payments resumed that the student loan borrowers monthly payment would be what it was before XXXX began and my payment was $ XXXX. 

In order to successfully comply and honor the XXXX week timeline, XXXX informed XXXX that my deadline to recertify in XXXX was XX/XX/XXXX. In order to meet the deadline, I filled out a paper-based income recertification application signed on XX/XX/XXXX and mailed it to XXXX. 

However, on XX/XX/XXXX the XXXX XXXX was announced ( same day as my XXXX recertification deadline ) and made retroactive to XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX day before my signed re-certication application ). I emphasize again that income recertifications were not required during the pause and that this income recertification would result in my payment increasing from $ XXXX to the XXXX standard-payment amount of $ XXXX starting XX/XX/XXXX. So XXXX should not have processed my IDR application, given it wasnt required and it was no longer in my best interest as a student loan borrower and because XXXX had clearly stated that the payments would resume at the amount they were before the XXXX pause began. I remind you that during this pause, borrowers were able to request refunds of payments made if it was in their best interest. All of the COIVD measures were made to act in the borrowers best interest. Indeed, I received correspondence from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX stating that they were unable to process my application request. The XXXX pandemic was an ongoing, evolving situation and, as a consequence, the XXXX pause was set to end multiple times and then extended multiple times. Each time the payment pause was set to end, student loan servicers, without any guidance from XXXX, sent out notification to their borrowers months in advance instructing them to recertify their income for XXXX plans. I did so, incorrectly, as instructed by XXXX and recertified again XX/XX/XXXX, which would have resulted in my payment increasing to {$2800.00}. However, again the pause was extended along with all the benefits associated with it, to include no requirement for income recertification. 

My student loans were transferred to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX after XXXX lost their contract with the federal government. Again my loans were transferred a third time to Mohela after I submitted a PSLF form on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, well before the XX/XX/XXXX deadline. My federal student loans were transferred to Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Much to my consternation Mohela had my projected payment on their website listed as being {$2800.00}. I was supposed to have XXXX more payments of $ XXXX left on my payment plan. However, with constantly changing information from XXXX, I decided to wait until more information came in about loans restarting and the requirement for income recertification. The new projected date to restart payments was XX/XX/XXXX. At this time multiple individuals on the internet were stating they too had been burdened with a higher monthly payment amount due to incorrectly recertifying during the covid pause at their student loan companys request. Many of these individuals were able to undo those recertifications and have their payments put back to their pre-covid levels. In a XXXX XXXX, I learned of an individual whose loans were serviced by Mohela who had recertified with XXXX in XXXX of XXXX causing his payment to increase by thousands of dollars. He transferred his loans to Mohela and then requested his income re-certication be reversed. They refused and he filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX Mohela granted his request ( XXXX years after he recertified ) and he posted the letter Mohela had written him on the XXXX XXXX. With this proof in hand, I called Mohela in XX/XX/XXXX and made this request for myself. I was denied. 

In XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I sent Mohela an in-box message asking for them to restore my payment to what it was pre-covid. 

On XX/XX/XXXX Mohela replied they submitted a request to put my payment back to what it was pre-covid. 

On XX/XX/XXXX they told me they received an IDR from me and that my application was incomplete. This is incorrect. I did not submit an IDR. I asked for them to restore my previous payment. 

The payment pause finally ended on XX/XX/XXXX and the guidance from XXXX was that income recertifications were STILL NOT required until XX/XX/XXXX. Effectively, this meant millions of student loan borrowers were making monthly payment amounts based on their XXXX income tax returns. Despite this instruction from XXXX, student loan companies STILL incorrectly bullied and harassed their borrowers under threat to recertify their income starting in XXXX of XXXX. Millions did, resulting in higher monthly payments. XXXX then took action and pushed the requirement for income recertification out AGAIN to XXXX of XXXX. I repeat, federal student loan borrowers are NOT required to recertify their income from the dates of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. Both of my recertifications happened within this time frame, causing me harm. Furthermore, XXXX took more aggressive action with these student loan companies who incorrectly threatened their borrowers into recertifying in early and instructed the companies to restore the monthly payment amounts to the previous lower payment amount. This is currently being enacted right now and I wish to be treated the same, even though I recertified much earlier than XX/XX/XXXX. The same XXXX happened to me as these individuals. I was told to recertify when I didnt have to and my payment went up. This has happened to millions since XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX has given clear instructions to the loan companies to restore the borrowers lower monthly payment. This is what I am asking for. It doesnt matter if I had recertified in XXXX of XXXX, XXXX of XXXX, or XX/XX/XXXX, the instruction from congress XXXX clear. Student loan borrowers werent required to recertify, so the companies are being instructed to restore borrowers lower monthly payments. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau explaining my situation. I told them that I wanted Mohela to deactivate my voluntary income disclosures made on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX during the COVID payment pause, because income recertifications were not required during this pause and this ultimately hurt me as a student loan borrower. I wanted them to restore my income disclosure I made on XX/XX/XXXX, which used my XXXX income tax return to calculate my monthly payment of {$590.00} and this was the payment amount active on XX/XX/XXXX when the covid pause began. I would never have recertified if I knew that income recertification wasnt going to be required until XXXX of XXXX, because it resulted in my payment increasing by thousands of dollars. And this is unfair because millions of student loan borrowers are still making monthly payment amounts from XXXX because they did not recertify as incorrectly instructed by their student loan servicers, like I unfortunately have. I have been harmed by following the instructions of my student loan servicers. 

Mohela responded on XX/XX/XXXX via the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau complaint that they would request additional information from ( my ) prior servicer for evaluation of ( my ) past repayment schedules eligibility for extension under the XXXX payment pause. This was excellent news to me, because I still had XXXX more months left on my plan when the pause began so I was definitely eligible for extension of my plan. I did not hear from Mohela again and called for an update in early XXXX. Mohela told me they had no record of my complaint to CFPB but they would submit my request again to revert my payment back to pre-covid levels. On XX/XX/XXXX, this is the response I received. Please note them telling me I need to recertify before XX/XX/XXXX AGAINST official federal guidance AND that they sent me this response on XX/XX/XXXX telling me I need to perform an action before XX/XX/XXXX ( clearly several months in the past. ) Thank you for contacting MOHELA, We apologize for any inconvenience this XXXX have caused. Your monthly payment has recently increased because the certification period for your reduced payment on your XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) plan has ended. You will need to recertify your IDR plan prior to the XXXX XXXX forbearance ending XX/XX/XXXX. 

In the interim I have sent multiple complaints, letters, correspondence to Mohela. Ive made many phone calls. On XX/XX/XXXX they sent me correspondence stating they denied my IDR application and that I needed to provide proof of income. I submitted my XXXX income tax return which was the tax return that was used to calculate my payment that I was making when the COVID pause began and I sent them a letter from XXXX stating that my XXXX plan was active from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX at a monthly payment of {$590.00} and I sent them a letter from XXXX explaining that I was in XXXX and what my monthly payment amounts have been each year since XXXX to XXXX. They responded back telling me that my tax return was old and I needed more recent income in order to recertify my income. Again I told them, I am not recertifying my income. I am asking to deactivate my XXXX prior income disclosures because they harmed me and werent required. After such exasperation, I finally resorted to sending them a screen shot and the Mohela letter I found online where they granted another individual my same request. When I asked them why they granted this individual my request, but not me, they told me they cant talk to me about other peoples accounts. I asked them to read the letter they sent to that individual out loud to me and tell me how I can achieve that same outcome and the person on the phone hung up on me. 
This is XXXX of the many messages I have sent to Mohela : My federal student loans were being serviced by XXXX at the start of XXXX. I am on the Income-Based Repayment plan ( IBR ) which is a type of Income-Driven Payment plan that requires yearly income recertification or the payment increases to the what the borrower would have paid had they been on a standard payment plan when first entering IBR. On XX/XX/XXXX I received notification that my XXXX payment would soon increase and that I needed to recertify my income by XX/XX/XXXX or my current payment rate ( {$590.00} ) would expire on XX/XX/XXXX and subsequent payments and would increase to {$2800.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted my XXXX recertification to XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX the XXXX Emergency Relief and Federal Student Aid ( COVID forbearance ) went into effect was announced with starting retroactively to XX/XX/XXXX. All federal student loan borrowers, including myself, were notified by XXXX that payments were automatically paused, interest was set at % XXXX, and income recertifications were not required while the forbearance was in effect. On XX/XX/XXXX I received the following email from XXXX XXXX could take up to XXXX business days for us to review and process this request for you. We understand that you want a response as quickly as possible and appreciate your patience.~~ However, the XXXX forbearance went into effect starting retroactively on XX/XX/XXXX. Thus, on XX/XX/XXXX my certification had NOT been officially processed and therefore my XXXX plan for XXXX, based on my XXXX tax return, was still active and in effect on XX/XX/XXXX when COVID forbearance began. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX sent me a correspondence date XX/XX/XXXX that I no longer met partial financial hardship and that my payment would increase to {$2800.00}. Thus, my recertification was processed on XX/XX/XXXX when recertifications were NOT required during the covid forbearance. I recertified again on XX/XX/XXXX after being inappropriately told by XXXX that I needed to recertify in time for student loan repayments to restart. This was not required since the XXXX relief act was extended. XX/XX/XXXX I received the following correspondence from XXXX XXXX XXXX Repayment ( XXXX ) plan request could not be processed.~~ On XX/XX/XXXX my loans were transferred to Aidvantage automatically after XXXX lost their federal student loan servicing XXXX. My loans were transferred to Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX after I submitted an XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Upon resumption of payments XX/XX/XXXX, The XXXX XXXX aid states that the earliest anyone would be required to submit income recertification is XX/XX/XXXX. Because I followed my student loan servicer~~s instructions and submitted my recertification 2 days before my deadline on XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX and because XXXX recertified again on XX/XX/XXXX due to incorrect instructions from XXXX, my XXXX has now significantly increased since the pause ended on XX/XX/XXXX. It has been increased to {$2800.00} after resumption of payments instead of remaining {$590.00} because I submitted these unrequired, voluntary recertifications. It is unfair for me to be punished for trying to do the right thing and I should be entitled to the same benefit afforded to everyone else as no one else as been required to recertify their income during the COVID forbearance starting XX/XX/XXXX Because my recertification deadline was XX/XX/XXXX, which is the exact date the COVID XXXX relief act was announced, and my payment due on XX/XX/XXXX was still scheduled to be {$590.00} from my XXXX XXXX recertification, and because recertifications were not REQUIRED I feel that my XXXX recertifications in XXXX and XXXX should be rescinded and that my XXXX XXXX recertification ( based on my XXXX income ) should be correctly honored and my payment should continue to remain at {$590.00} until I am actually official required to recertify. I contacted MOHELA representatives via telephone and my request was escalated to a supervisor. They both told me that these unrequired recertifications from XXXX and XXXX could not be undone, which I know to be untrue from research online, where others have been able to get their recertifications submitted during the forbearance undone. I submitted a complaint to the CFPB and Mohela stated they were """" requesting additional information from your prior servicer for evaluation of your past repayment schedule~~s eligibility for extension under the XXXX payment pause. '' I called today XX/XX/XXXX for an update and was told mohela had no knowledge of this complaint but escalated my request for rescinding my XXXX recertifications form XX/XX/XXXX onward. My case number for this encounter is XXXX. I expect my payment to be reverted to {$590.00} and to receive a refund for overpayments from XXXX, XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and any further months spent in overpayment. I do NOT consent to be placed in any forbearance related to processing my request. 


I am attaching some PDFS including my letter from XXXX stating my active XXXX plan of $ XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, a letter to Mohela explaining XXXX what I wanted accomplished, the screenshot of the letter Mohela wrote XXXX a third individual whose request was granted, as well as the screenshot from a XXXX group XXXX XXXX third individual explained his situation. All of these correspondences have been ignored my Mohela and they flat out refuse to discuss the fact that they are discriminating against me by granting another individual my request and not me.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","MO","65775","","Consent provided","Web",2024-04-01,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8667188,2024

Mohela ended up kicking me out of my plan and raising my payments from {$90.00} to over {$400.00} because they said I did not recertify on time. Since they are tied to federal loans they should be following that same statement. I called Mohela when I saw a payment for over {$400.00} processing from my bank account. Mohela said that the best they can do is put me in forbearance for the next few months and refund my money.

Per the guidelines for the SAVE plan, however, this payment should have dropped *precipitously* to approximately {$14.00} dollars a month ( 225 % of the federal poverty line for a family of four would be XXXX, and the SAVE plan only entails a 5 % payment on the remainder over 225 % of the FPL ; 5 % of {$3300.00} per annum works out to {$14.00} a month ). When Mohela informed me, however, that I had been put on the SAVE plan, they did not in any way recalculate the payment ; they simply said I had been switched to SAVE and then left us with the {$160.00} a month payment. I reached out and pointed out the error, and they returned me to administrative forbearance, and I received an email sometime later saying that the payment had been recalculated to {$9.00} a month ( where exactly this number came from is beyond me, Mohela does not bother to communicate in any clear way to customers how they calculate *anything*, which has been a major part of the issue ). They still left our account saying, however, that we *owed* that {$160.00} dollars. I reached out again, pointing out that they needed to fix the amount owed and reminding them that the Biden Administrations guidelines to student loan servicers clearly indicated that no payments should resume before people were switched to the SAVE plan. They again but me in administrative forbearance ( though did not in any way respond to my email ), and cleared the amount due shown on my account. 

Today I received notification that there was new action on my account, only to log in and see that it now showed I owed * $ XXXX. At this point I see little recourse but to file complaints with the CFPB and with the FSA Ombudsman to try to compel Mohela to resolve this issue, as they have had half a year and several attempts at me contacting them to rectify this problem, and have consistently failed to ( something, it should be noted, that is not confined to my case - complaints have proliferated nationally for months of the ways in which Mohela has mishandled SAVE administration, and the DoE has already had to levy hefty fines against Mohela for their mismanagement ). 

For the time being, I have paid and will continue to pay that amount of {$9.00} a month, as a show of good faith- I have no desire, after all, to avoid my obligation to pay back my student loans, I simply expect that Mohela will pursue that repayment accurately and fairly according to the rules established by the Department of Education.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","NC","27704","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-25,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8223115,2024

This was approved by great lakes with all loans listed as eligible and a monthly repayment amount of {$1900.00} due to start in XX/XX/XXXX ( this was later extended when the XXXX payment pause was prolonged ). 

When my PSLF application was processed, my loans were transferred to Mohela in XXXX of XXXX, but for some reason my IDR plan was not transferred and I was initially listed as being in standard repayment. I called Mohela and they said they would refile the IDR ( unfortunately they also recertified my income without my consent and my payment amounts rose by XXXX dollars ). I received notice from Mohela XX/XX/XXXX that all my loans were eligible for IDR and my new payment amount would be {$2000.00} per month. 

On XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX, Mohela placed my account on an administrative forebearance, presumably to switch from REPAYE to the SAVE plan ( though this was never discussed with me ). On completion of the forbearance, only XXXX of my student loan disbursements were listed on the SAVE plan with the remaining 5 loans listed as on level repayment and my repayments went up to XXXX.

However, according to studnentaid.gov, under covid -19 announcement, if my recertification date falls between now and XX/XX/XXXX, it will be pushed out by one year. Therefore, it should be pushed out to XX/XX/XXXX.

The automated system prompted me to input my SSN and last four digits of my phone number, which, despite having an account, it did not recognize. I was placed on hold for approximately XXXX hour and XXXX minutes before being connected with XXXX at approx. XXXX XXXX. I find the length of the hold as well as the fact there were no time estimates on how long the hold would be to be unacceptable. I was about to hang up a few minutes later and likely would have if I didn't connect to XXXX when I did, which would have wasted a significant amount of my time. I asked XXXX questions about three different topics, two of which did not make complete sense to me. First, I have noticed that payments from my recent PSLF application used for employment certification were listed as """" XXXX - XXXX XXXX. '' I asked about this because I have been making payments since XX/XX/XXXX and wanted to make sure this was not a reference to the previous XXXX emergency special waiver. XXXX told me it is due to the XXXX waiver and the information is correct. This is strange to me and I would like additional clarification. Second, I followed up with XXXX about the date of my required IDR renewal, which was the topic of a prior CFPB complaint ( CFPB complaint XXXX, which is also attached for reference ). In that complaint, I noted that the MOHELA web portal and a physically mailed letter from MOHELA both have different deadlines for XXXX certification. As a result of the differing information, I asked XXXX about this. She gave me a third date for IDR re-certification, a soft deadline of XX/XX/XXXX. I find this extremely concerning because 1 ) this date is earlier than the renewal dates on both the portal and the prior letter, 2 ) XXXX stated that this is a """" soft '' deadline to allow me to meet the real deadline ( which she was unable to provide ) but which was based on a processing timeline of 80 days, and 3 ) these dates keep moving forward over time, for which I believe there is no reasonable explanation. I am concerned because if either of the other two deadlines are my hard deadline, then based on an 80 day processing window, submitting my IDR renewal on or near this new soft deadline would cause me to miss the recertification deadline. I would like accurate information on when I am required to recertify my XXXX payments so that I can remain at a reduced SAVE payment rate. I do not want to risk missing a deadline, but with MOHELA staff unable to provide clear information, I am not sure when to actually recertify my XXXX. XXXX also helped on a third topic, which was me asking for an in-school deferment waiver form. She told me it would take a few days to receive one - we will see if that happens and I will file a new complaint if I do not.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","GA","30341","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-24,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8218402,2024

Multiple calls every single month, as they continually moved my loans from repayment status to in-school deferment. I am in school, but submitted a request to have them ignore updates from my school, specifically because MOHELA told me they will move my loans from repayment to deferment every single time they receive any correspondence from my school. It took around XXXX months for the form to be processed, and just within the last few days, it shows as completed in my account. So, I no longer expect to see any changes to my repayment status without my approval. 

So, now, there had to be another issue because otherwise it wouldn't be MOHELA. On XX/XX/2024, I received yet another correspondence letter from MOHELA stating that there were changes in my repayment terms. I immediately checked my loans and XXXX of them had been converted to a different payment plan. I never requested this, and I have never dealt with anything like this when my loans were XXXX XXXX XXXX. I immediately called MOHELA and asked that the loan be placed back on the SAVE plan, like all my other loans were. The request was supposedly submitted by the agent who took my call. I check my account every day since then ( roughly XXXX weeks ago ), and there has been no change. 

So, I called today, and the person who took my call said that the loan was placed on. different repayment plan because XXXX XXXX XXXX loans are not eligible for the SAVE plan. I knew this was inaccurate, as I read up on the new SAVE plan at length during the entire time it was being introduced. XXXX XXXX XXXX are not eligible for the SAVE plane, but my XXXX loan is a XXXX XXXX loan, and 100 % eligible for the SAVE plan. She admitted I was correct, then placed me on hold several times for about XXXX minutes while she tried to check in with a supervisor about what they could do.

They do not know what they are doing and I can not believe that this company has been given the reigns to control the finances for so many student loan borrowers.

My loans have a payment date of the XXXX of each month. With the SAVE plan, any amount not covered by my payment is covered by an interest subsidy. This means that I accrue no interest whole on this plan. The loan place on the other plan ( the """" XXXX '' plan ) now has a payment of {$50.00}, due on the XXXX of each month. So if this issue doesn't get solved, I end up being forced to pay {$50.00} or risk my credit score being damaged by something that is not my fault. If I do get the matter fixed, I will still have accrued interest that did not get covered by this month 's subsidy since it is highly unlikely that they will switch the loan back to the SAVE plan before the XXXX ( in XXXX days ).

Throughout the years of repaying Discover Student Loans, I had various unexpected costs that occurred that prevented me to pay Discover Student Loans. Whenever I would call to make arrangements, I was always presented with pay in full or utilize one of their several entrapping forbearance or payment pause solutions. 
My student loan payments with Discover started around the upper {$500.00} to low {$600.00} range and now increased to nearly {$1200.00} per month. 
After a few financial situations throughout the years when I would contact Discover for relief, I figured it out that their plans hurt me long term more than help. But trying to increase and/or preserve my credit score, I would obliged to Discover 's entrapping solutions. Nearly each time I would discuss matters with Discover, representatives would pepper me with questions regarding my student loans with other companies and would advise me to discuss relief with my other providers rather than Discover discuss my loans as my bill with Discover was three to four times more than my other loan providers and is now currently six times more.

When I would advise Discover my other loans were manageable and that Discovers loans were most troubling, Discover representatives would attempt to direct me to my Federal student loan provider. Again, when I advise my Federal loans payments are my lowest payments and most manageable, Discover representatives would then discuss ways to """" help '' me. Per usual, the help was either pay in full or utilized one of their forms of forbearance. 
When I would ask is there any other method that decreased payments while also preserving the credit score I was attempting to rebuild, I would be told no.

I further questioned if I am having difficulties paying the amount owed at the time and monthly payments would increase once the program ended in a few months, how does it help overall. Of course they advised of the immediate """" benefit '' but would be told those are the only options. 
Fast forward years later of attempting to stay afloat, I find myself in dire financial straits and owing nearly $ XXXX  month and exhausting every money option to stay afloat.

2024-01-31,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","At the end of XX/XX/XXXX I began receiving notices from Ed Financial Services that my first student loan payment would be due XX/XX/XXXX, approximately a week before the payment was due, stating that I owed nearly {$1300.00} that month. When I called customer service ( after being on hold for nearly 5 hours ), I was told this was incorrect and my account would be updated with the correct amount in around 45 business days. I was also told verbally that my first payment was actually due on XX/XX/XXXX ( not XX/XX/XXXX ), which was confirmed with updated due dates on my account. On this same day, I also emailed Ed Financial regarding the same issues, I did not receive a call back until XX/XX/XXXX. By this time, the past due amount of ~ {$1300.00} was still showing on my account and I was unable to pay my upcoming bill due on XX/XX/XXXX without paying the past due amount. When speaking with a customer service agent, she then told me that the past due amount was incorrect and would be removed from my account, however, that my payments were actually supposed to begin XX/XX/XXXX which I was never notified of. In order to avoid paying the incorrect late payments, she had me submit payment over the phone for both XXXX and XXXX totaling {$330.00}, as my correct monthly payments are {$160.00}. This monthly payment amount was confirmed by her as well as displayed as the amount due on my account. 

The payment of {$330.00} was posted to my account, however, it is now XX/XX/XXXX and my XXXX payments are still listed as past due. I contacted customer support for a third time and I was told that the past due amount was because my monthly payments were actually supposed to be {$900.00}, despite this being reflected nowhere on my account or in any communications I've had with Ed Financial previously. After restating that my payments show at {$160.00} on my end ( the same amount that I had submitted payment for for the previous two months ) I was then told that the agent could not figure out what was wrong and would submit a request for my account to be looked at. After which I informed her that my next payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX and I would be unable to pay it without paying the incorrect past due amount also posted to my account. I was then placed back on hold. She told me that their system was not matched up to what was displaying and she would need to put in a request to fix it, which I have been told by multiple customer support agents since XX/XX/XXXX, with no explanation of how or if the faulty past due amount would be removed from my account. The call ended with no resolution and being told a ticket has been submitted to look into my account. It has now been nearly 4 months with no resolution where I am being charged far more than my payments due and faulty missed payments are being applied to my account with the potential to severely impact my credit score. Additionally, I am unable to make upcoming payments as the system requires me to pay any past due amounts as well, which in my case are all incorrect. Attached is a pdf of my account and loan summary with a record of my XX/XX/XXXX payment at the bottom. There is no reason that it should take this many months for me to be able to accurately make payments on my loans.","","EdFinancial Services","MA","02138","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-31,"Closed with explanation","No","N/A",8256273,2024

The XXXX amount was too much per month in the long term, and I wanted to move into the XXXX repayment plan. As of XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX full months after I submitted my request to XXXX my payment plan, my account was still showing under the Graduated repayment plan. 

Second, Mohela did not give me the proper notice that my loans were due and once they did, had the incorrect payment plan and payment amount. I received my first payment statement via email on XX/XX/XXXX which was about XXXX days to notify me of my first payment being due on XX/XX/XXXX. The payment amount was still showing as the XXXX amount, not the XXXX repayment plan, which I had requested be changed back on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Third, on XX/XX/XXXX, my loan was placed into XXXX XXXX with no explanation of why, no date as to when the payments may resume or any type of information on what was going on with my loan. I was notified of this XXXX via email, and it simply stated that my loan was placed into XXXX XXXX, no other information was provided. I received another email on XX/XX/XXXX, stating they were processing my change in repayment plan and my next bill would be due in XXXX. Which is it? That I have a bill due or that I was placed into administrative forbearance? How can you tell me you are placing me in XXXX in XXXX email and then turn around and send me a second email and say my bill is due? And, calling them is a nightmare. Hours to hold on the phone to wait to talk to someone. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX my loan is back under repayment, and it shows under a """" XXXX '' plan, I have no idea what that means. I chose the XXXX repayment plan. I have never heard of a XXXX plan. The amount shown is not what the XXXX repayment amount was showing when I put the request in to change my payment plan in XX/XX/XXXX and there was no explanation provided to me for why they put me into this different plan under a different amount. Why was my payment plan changed XXXX months after I requested it? And why was it changed to a plan that I have no knowledge of the terms and did not agree to? How can they change my plan to something that I was not notified of or explained how it would impact me? 

The handling of my student loan return to repayment has been disorganized, confusing and frustrating. Mohela has not provided me with adequate information on the status of my loans, and they took over XXXX months to begin to process a change in repayment plan for my loans. They put me in forbearance with no explanation. They have not explained how they came up with the payment amount that I have. How am I supposed to plan financially to repay these loans when due dates and amounts keep changing and the terms of the plan Mohela placed me in are unclear? 

I have XXXX confidence that my payment amount is correct and that Mohela is processing my loans in a correct and timely manner.

The loan breakdown is as follows : XXXX  XXXX Loan Date ) - XXXX XXXX {$2000.00} original balance XX/XX/XXXX ( Loan Date ) - XXXX XXXX {$6600.00} original balance XX/XX/XXXX ( Loan Date ) - XXXX XXXX, {$8500.00} original balance As provided in the attached documentation, Aspire issued me a 1099c for the XX/XX/XXXX & the XXXX  loans, they issued this 1099c to me in XXXX ( attached. ) After a long delayed battle with Aspire, they FINALLY updated the 1099c to reflect the correct indefinable event code. As XXXX XXXX points out in her response to CFBP, she notes that Aspire had right to write off this debt as it was time barred and Aspire was in legal right to do so because of their """" administrative policies. '' However, in XXXX Iowa Student Loan/Aspire filed small claims against me for the XX/XX/XXXX loan, which held the EXACT same characteristics as the other two loans - it was time barred and had not received payment in over 10 years. 

XXXX XXXX is yet to identify how/why the XX/XX/XXXX loan could have further action taken against it in XXXX yet the remaining XXXX loans ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) bearing the SAME account standing was not written off, but further pursued for payment. What """" policy '' does XXXX XXXX have that supports that choice that is in legal compliance of state and federal law? 

To quote XXXX XXXX 's response, """" XXXX XXXX signed a promissory note and agreed to the terms as outlined in the credit agreement when she applied for the private education loans. Copies of the signed promissory notes and credit agreements were sent to XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX notifying her that the balance on the loans had been written off, but we are resending them directly to her again along with a copy of this response. The credit agreements were issued under Iowa law, and they clearly identify the provisions for default. Under Iowa law, the statute of limitations for collecting on unpaid debt that stems from a written contract is 10 years.Because payments were not received from XXXX in that time period, the debt went out of statute. As a result, Aspire Servicing Center wrote off the loans on XXXX XXXX XXXX At that time, the IRS required the issuance of the 1099-C. The 1099-Cwas provided to both the IRS and XXXX XXXX for theXXXX tax reporting season. XXXX XXXX has stated that Aspire Servicing Center has refused to provided documentation of the reason for the 1099-C. The1099-C is used for the cancellation of debt as stated on the form itself and on the XXXX form issued by Aspire Servicing Center. XXXX XXXX contained student loan as the debt description and provided the date of the identifiable event in XXXX XXXX.

This further support that Aspire/ISL took action - by issuing me a XXXX 1099c to hurt my credit by placing me in arears with IRS yet fails to state what policy allowed them to do so, yet take legal action on debt that was older?","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","IOWA STUDENT LOAN LIQUIDITY CORPORATION","IA","52402","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-19,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8182915,2024

My full ( approx ) {$340000.00} in loans are still not reflected on Mohela, and my monthly payments have not been counting towards PSLF.

2024-01-04,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Problem with customer service","Good afternoon, Over 2 months ago, I submitted an application through XXXX to switch into the XXXX repayment plan. I received confirmation from Aidvantage that the application had been received and was processing. I waited some time and then emailed aidvantage customer support to get an update regarding the application. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from aidvantage customer support requesting that I be patient with aidvantage to be enrolled in the XXXX plan as their company has received an overwhelming amount of calls and emails from customers and would need time to respond to everyone and process all the applications. In that email, I was told to give Aidvantage 30-45 days to process my application and enroll me in the XXXX plan. At this point, we have surpassed 45 days by over 2 weeks. I received that email on XX/XX/XXXX. And today is XX/XX/XXXX. It has been over 60 days at this point and I have not received any new information or updates from Aidvantage. I feel I have been more than patient. As I'm sure you can understand, this is very distressing. I made my 1st payment of {$550.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and nearly overdrew my account. That amount is staggering to me and simply not affordable. I can not continue to make that payment going forward however, I also am a responsible person and absolutely do not want to default on my loans. I have no problem making on time monthly payments I can afford. Under the new XXXX plan, my projected monthly payment is around {$200.00}. That is an amount I can afford for the foreseeable future. I requested an update regarding when I will be enrolled in the XXXX plan, and hopefully, it is just days away. I will not be able to make another payment of {$550.00} this month or any month in the future. It is simply too high due to my current income. Additionally, I have sent between 40 and 130 emails every day this week to Aidvantage customer support and have received no response from them. They are showing to be truly incompetent as my student loan servicer. They need to be held accountable. They are harming peoples financial situations due to their ineptitude.

2024-02-29,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","Hello, I suspect that my student loan servicer, Edfinancial, is deliberately committing financial fraud and I believe I have enough evidence to prove a probable cause for investigation. I hope that, upon reviewing my evidence below, you are willing to work with both the Department of Education and the Department of Justice to remedy this issue.

A policy of Federal student loans is that if a borrower signs up for auto-pay, there is a .25 % deduction in their interest rate. This may not sound like much, but adds up over a large loan and a long enough time. To take advantage of this incentive, I signed up for auto-pay with Edfinancial and received a confirmation email for it. I regularly auto-pay out of this bank account and was not informed of any failures by Edfinancial. When the payments were due, however, the auto-pay did not happen. This went on for a while without my notice. I eventually noticed the failure and had to pay manually. My .25 % deduction did not apply as autopay was not actually set up despite their confirmation email. Additionally, my otherwise solid credit score has been negatively impacted by this failure and potentially cascading consequences for my financial situation in the future. 

Believing this to be an error, I looked online for further examples and found examples going back many months. Here are some examples of others online who had the same struggle as I did : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX These are just the examples from the front page of XXXX found within my first minute of research. I am certain that there will be many more if, for example, a federal government department that was paid to investigate fraud were to look into it. As reported by users here, this is a problem repeatedly reported by many users across many months. As someone who works in an IT company that often pushes out fixes in a couple of weeks, I hope you can trust me when I say that this is well enough time for a company to program a fix. The fact that this is an ongoing issue makes me believe that this is deliberate and that Edfinancial has a monetary incentive to not give us the .25 % interest deduction.

If you agree with me that this evidence is at minimum suspect, I hope you work with the appropriate authorities to stop Edfinancial from unjustly enriching themselves at the expense of studentsandgraduates.","","EdFinancial Services","WI","53719","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-29,"Untimely response","No","N/A",8445454,2024

The promise to me spoken by XXXX and student aid ombudsman was that an income based consolidation loan would also honor my years of payment, thereby cancelling some of my student debt after 20 or 25 years of repayment. I started paying in XXXX, with a break in forbearance on my loans, but have been consistent with paying XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( now XXXX ), since XXXX, under SAVE and IBR. My most recent Tax Return was submitted along with this consolidation loan application request to show that I was eligible for an income based repayment plan. MOHELAs calculations show an Income Contingent Repayment ( ICR ) for {$850.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX ( a Friday ), I received a processed Direct Consolidation application from XXXX. XXXX  processes Federal Student Aid for MOHELA, also a Federal Student Aid company. The information within this processed application shows a consolidated loan that will be subject to standard repayment. That amount can range from {$2600.00} to {$4100.00}, depending on what they select. In at the letter I was asked to respond within 10 days. However, the date on the letter is XX/XX/XXXX.

In talking with MOHELA, I find out that the loan was told that the loan was still uploading. I would later find out after much questioning that the loan processed by XXXX  was returned to MOHELA for final processing ( disbursement to XXXX and notification to me ).

2024-02-05,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","My income recertification on Mohela was originally listed for XX/XX/XXXX. I called them about this in early XXXX. Due to new rules ( see link and quotes at bottom ) since my recertification date was prior to XX/XX/XXXX, this should not have to be recertified until XX/XX/XXXX. I called on XX/XX/XXXX, this was escalated to a supervisor ( their ID is XXXX ) that called me back on XX/XX/XXXX. They told me I was correct and I would receive something confirming via email in the next week. Nothing came, so I called on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  and spoke to I believe a supervisor ( ID XXXX ). Once again, they told me I was correct and not to be concerned that I should get something in the next 5-6 days. Nothing came, when I log into Mohela, then the income recertification date showed XX/XX/XXXX. So I called multiple times again, 7 times over 2 days on XXXX and XXXX, and kept transferring around and was ultimately transferred to a supervisor each time and no one picks up. A supervisor ( ID XXXX ) eventually called me back on XXXX, told me my recertification date was actually XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  so I do not qualify for the extension. When I asked why it said XX/XX/XXXX initially and then XX/XX/XXXX, he said these were 'soft dates ' to give them time to process. When I got the opportunity to log into a computer and check studentaid.gov, my anniversary date ( recertification date ) is listed as XX/XX/XXXX, so I would fall under the group that does not have to recertify until the next calendar year. The XX/XX/XXXX is the date of my next projected payment after recertification. I called Mohela back, and got transferred to 2 individuals again only to get no one were and got directed to a supervisor voicemail. 

I have spent 8-10hours/week the last 3 weeks calling my loan servicer and quite frankly exhausted and demoralized at how inconsistent agents and supervisors are in providing accurate and up to date information. No one can give me a coherent answer for why the recertification keeps migrating depending on who you speak to. At certain times, it feels like dates are being pulled out of thin air. 

I would greatly appreciate any assistance you can do to investigate the poor practices. 

Below is the guidance from Dept of Ed https : //studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19 """" When do I have to recertify my IDR plan? 
The earliest you could be required to recertify is XX/XX/XXXX. 

On your account My Aid page, you may still see a recertification date that is earlier than XX/XX/XXXX. We are working to get those updated, and we thank you for your patience. 

If your recertification date falls between now and XX/XX/XXXX, it will be pushed out by one year. For example, if your account says your recertification date is XXXX XXXX, XXXX, that date will be pushed out to XXXX XXXX, XXXX.

The last call I had was in XXXX with MOHELA, I finally got hold of a representative for the second time, they said they would try to submit for SAVE plan for my plans and they said she would put my loans on forbearance until then.

My name is XXXX XXXX, and I am writing to express my profound disappointment and distress regarding my recent experience with Mohela, particularly concerning the update ( or lack thereof ) on the status of my application for student loan forgiveness.

Over the past few months, I have encountered significant challenges that have not only impacted my financial stability but have also taken a toll on my health. As a person living with a XXXX, these challenges have exacerbated my situation to the extent that affording essential medications has become a struggle, further endangering my health and well-being.

I had placed my trust in the student loan forgiveness program as a beacon of hope that could alleviate some of the financial burdens and allow me to concentrate on improving my health. Unfortunately, the lack of updates and communication from Mohela regarding the progress or adjustments to my loan forgiveness application has left me in a state of uncertainty and despair.

Given the severity of my current life circumstances, including my XXXX and the direct impact on my ability to manage my health effectively, I am reaching out to request an immediate review and processing of my application for loan and interest discharge. This relief is not just a financial necessity but a critical lifeline that will enable me to focus on my health without the looming stress of insurmountable debt.

I understand that there are protocols and procedures in place for handling such requests, but I kindly urge you to consider the gravity of my situation. Discharging my loans and interest would not only rectify the distress caused by the lack of action on Mohela 's part but would also provide me with the means to move forward, prioritizing my health and recovery.

I am more than willing to provide any additional information or documentation required to facilitate this process. Please guide me through the next steps and any specific actions I need to undertake to expedite my request.

Thank you for your understanding and prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your compassionate consideration and a resolution that will help lighten the burdens I currently face.

She did EVEN extend the basic courtesy to ask a 2nd time to double check if she had gotten my social security number wrong or ask me to confirm my account number or anything else.

2024-01-29,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Problem with customer service","I was cursed with Mohela after the XXXX XXXX XXXX on student loans. They were my assigned servicer. They are absolutely horrible. Months go by if you send them an electronic message to which they only respond that they are reviewing your message. You never get an actual answer. You will spend most of your work day, from the job you need to pay off your student loans, on hold trying to get a customer service rep. Due to Mohela, my loans were put on another forbearance ( after the XXXX one ended ) until XX/XX/XXXX because they were being fined by the government for not handling business correctly. Back in XXXX XXXX in preparation for my student loans coming out of forbearance again, I went to the Mohela website and signed up for email/text notifications of all payments due, past due or auto debited from my account and also signed up for auto debit of all future payments to come directly out of my checking account. I never received any communication from them but in XX/XX/XXXX I went to their website and it showed that my auto debit was all set up for my payment to come out for my XXXX XXXX payment. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I realized I have never received a notice from my bank about my payment being drafted. NOR have I received a single text or email from Mohela about my payment being due or being late. I log on to the website and low & behold they are saying my payment is delinquent. My auto debit on the screen shows nothing and I have no messages on their site either. I call customer service, was told it would be a 41 minute wait, at 59 minutes, I had to end my call to take a call from my child who was stranded on the side of the road with his vehicle. I called again and requested a call back. ( By the way, you have to sit in the que for almost 5 minutes just for the option to request a call back. ) The rep called me back 42 minutes later. She offered nothing. She said her system showed her that I received every text notification about my payments & that they sent me a letter XX/XX/XXXX saying that my auto debit would not be ready until XXXX XXXX. I never received this. Had I received this, I would of immediately made my XXXX of XXXX payment until the auto debit kicked in for XXXX. The rep read off my phone number, my email and my mailing address, yet she had no possible idea why I haven't received a single communication from them. Nor have I received any electronic communication from them regarding this XXXX of XXXX payment. This company is fraudulent. I made my XXXX payment this morning and specifically warned the rep that if my """" delinquent '' payment is posted to my credit report, I will be contacting legislators. Furthermore, this particular """" customer service '' rep HUNG UP ON ME... .simply for pointing out that with the thousands of complaints against them, they won't have a job much longer. If this goes on my credit report, another complaint is coming to you guys and the XXXX  which I also reported them too. I am not trying to not pay, I just don't want to be forced to work with crooks. They are not working for us, they are making it impossible for us to take care of our obligations. You can already see the thousands of complaints on this site and the XXXX  regarding how Mohela is doing business and how they are hurting the consumer. I am not deliquent, I did my due diligence and signed up for the auto debit as they suggested on their site so that I do not miss payments. I also signed up for all electronic alerts so that I could stay on top of my payments and this company wants to treat me like I am trying to hide from my payments. They are only going to continue to lie to the consumers and say that they did everything on their end, when they clearly have not. I encourage everyone that deals with them like I had to, to voice their complaint and take it as high as you can.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","MT","596XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-29,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8245670,2024

2024-01-10,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","I'm having several issues with Nelnet. My loans were transferred in XXXX to their company from Great Lakes. I had no issues with Great Lakes, in fact, my experience was excellent. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email stating that I had an incomplete IBR Application that was recently submitted. I've not submitted any new IBR applications since XXXX XXXX and I had the concern that this was false information. I attempted to call NelNet, and was given a 90 minute wait time. Unfortunately, with work, I do not have the ability to wait on hold for 1.5 hours during the day. I went back through, and StudentAid.Gov confirmed in XXXX XXXX  that my IBR was received and approved for 12 months. I'm not sure why Nelnet is sending me information as such. 

The second issue I'm having, is Nelnet is showing my loan as """" past due '' or """" late '' when it's in fact been paid each month. I'm on an IBR SAVE plan, and I pay the amount due each month. Nelnet confirms they've received my payment, but then marks my loans as past due, and shows warnings that I need to make a payment after I've already paid and it's been processed. This didn't seem like a big deal until yesterday, XXXX when I received a formal email from StudentAid.Gov stating that Nelnet reached out to them saying I missed a payment. I immediately logged into the website, and sure enough, my payment was received for XX/XX/XXXX, processed, and the website shows my next due date isn't until XXXX XXXX XXXX. I'm really hoping this incorrect information does not make it to my credit report. 

I've attempted to contact Nelnet via email, which they're stating """" Sorry, we're experiencing a delay in our replies '', as well as via the phone. Each time I call on the phone, there's a minimum of 90 minute hold times, and once was quoted 30 minutes, only to sit on hold for 75 minutes before having to hang up. 

The third issue I'm having is with their website. It seems to be down a lot, and when attempting to login, I'm given an authorization code, which never works. Copied direct from the text or email, it seems to fail at least every other time I login. As such, I'm frequently locked out of my account, and have to reset the password, even though my password and authentication code were correct. 

I'm not sure what else to do. I'm paying my loans as I should, and I'm being threatened with action for """" missed payments '' that were already processed weeks ago.","","Nelnet, Inc.","OH","439XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-10,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8140449,2024

I am currently in the standard repayment plan and have called twice about setting up autopayment, both times I registered, did not receive email confirmation and was told from customer phone support I needed to make a manual payment before the autopayment due date would kick in. I made a manual payment on XX/XX/XXXX waiting for autopayment to occur on XX/XX/XXXX, which did not occur, and called again and was told autopayment was setup and to just make another manual payment. I made another manual payment on XX/XX/XXXX waiting for autopayment to kick on on XX/XX/XXXX, but autopayment did not kick in again. Upon logging in no money was taken from the account and the payment date was changed to XX/XX/XXXX, despite no money being taken from the account and autopay not showing. 
I called for a third time and was told autopayment never was added to my account ( I have added it twice ), they have no record of autopayment signup, and that I needed to sign up again. This time, when I added autopayment, I received an email confirmation ( despite not receiving one the other two times ) and was told it would kick in 30-60 days and I would have to make manual payments again until then.

2024-01-08,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I have been wanting to start auto-paying my student loans since XX/XX/XXXX and my student loan provider, Nelnet, is not allowing it while they capitalize interest on my account. 

It is my firm belief that Nelnet is being purposely unethical and predatory on my student loan account, racking up accumulated interest that they claim will not be applicable for forgiveness on the SAVE Plan, even though the DoE has stated otherwise, due to a forced administrative forbearance that I did not know or consent to. I have done everything on my end that I can to do to get this administrative forbearance off my account, yet they keep applying it. My payment due date has now been pushed to spring of XXXX and my XXXX application is still in process. 

History of Correspondence : On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted my application for the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I received confirmation of this email by the U.S. Department of Education. When I submitted the application, I selected the prompt that I wished to start paying back my student loans IMMEDIATELY. I did NOT select forbearance. I also selected the option for recertification through the IRS tool. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to Nelnet Customer Service for clarification as to what was happening with my account. After an over 2 hour wait, I spoke to a female agent who told me my account was placed into administrative forbearance, because of the volume of applications Nelnet was receiving, and that this administrative forbearance was a """" courtesy '' to allow them extra time to process everything ; A courtesy, that can not be removed and was applied to my account without my knowledge or consent, as again, I selected that I wanted to start repaying immediately in my application when I first submitted it. She told me I could start repaying as soon as I want, but manually, and so the auto-debit discount would not apply. Furthermore, she told me that I would be responsible for ALL interest accured on my account due to this administrative forbearance. She confirmed my application was still in process and that I should receive additional communications stating my loan applications have been approved no later than XX/XX/XXXX. She also told me that applications take an average of XXXX business days to process and that my first payment is due in XXXX, XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to Nelnet Customer Service for clarification, again, as to what was happening with my account. I spoke briefly to a female agent by the name of XXXX who was at a loss on how to assist me. I asked to be transferred to her supervisor. Her supervisor, XXXX, told me that proof of income was needed for both mine and my wife 's IDR application. When my wife questioned it, XXXX replied that this is standard procedure from studentaid.gov based on """" new legislation '' that was passed by Congress. But, we can bypass providing all this """" tax information '' if I provide proof of income in the form of a self-wrote declaration letter. My wife inquired if this was standard procedure for student loan borrowers looking to switch to an IDR plan for the first time, then why wasn't it disclosed during the application process so I could've provided this information in advance to speed along my application without hiccups. XXXX replied, """" it's in the fine print. '' My wife and I expressed concern and frustration at lack of transparency. XXXX said that after about 15 days of uploading this letter to my account that I should receive additional communications on the status of my application, and that if my application is not processed by XX/XX/XXXX when my first payment is due, that the administrative forbearance will be extended on my account. He echoed what the first customer service agent said, and stated that I am responsible for paying any interest due on my account even with administrative forbearance preventing my auto-debit from occuring, and the only way around this is to make manual payments. 

I have not received any update or communications on the processing of my XXXX application since.","","Nelnet, Inc.","MI","48183","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-08,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8122932,2024

They would not provide me an interest rate on my loans so when I made payments, I could not direct it to loans with a higher rate.

I refinanced my loans in XXXX with XXXX and a payment exceeding my total loan debt was sent. Mohela cashed the check but did not credit my account and continues to call me for payments. I have spent over 10 hours on hold attempting to speak to a supervisor and I have been sent to dead ends or have been hung up on. I've expressed to them that I am getting spam calls, so I need to speak to someone when I call in versus waiting for a supervisor however they have failed to connect me after assuring me that after waiting I would. When the supervisor calls, they call from an unknown number and provide a call back to the main number which starts the process all over again. I am also a surgeon and unable to step away from patient care when I am operating which makes this process more difficult. It also looks like I have over XXXX in student debt with Mohela and XXXX with XXXX now. This also impedes my ability to obtain business loans for my private practice.

2024-02-21,"Student loan","Private student loan","Struggling to repay your loan","Bankruptcy","I'd contacted XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to check on my account ( XXXX ) as I'd noticed some issues. It looked as though my account had become default, but I was almost certain that they couldn't have gone through with that fully, considering I hadn't yet exceeded 30 days past my 90 day mark ( 120 is default ), which would have been my last payment. 

You can clearly see in images I provided that this date was XX/XX/XXXX ( filename : """" last transaction ... '' ). 

Upon speaking with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and then Citizen 's Bank Asset Recovery Department ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I'd learned that my Loan account was actually placed into default on XX/XX/XXXX. 5 days prior to what would have truly been 120 days past due. My bank statement illustrates how funds weren't even removed from my account until 3 days after XX/XX/XXXX ( filename : """" statement screenshot ... '' ). 

I'd actually chosen XX/XX/XXXX at the suggestion of a Citizens Bank Collection employee prior to ensure it was postmarked BEFORE I'd hit 120 days past due. And I'd called XXXX the following day, XXXX the XXXX, because funds had not been removed from my checking account as requested on the XXXX. I wasn't aware XXXX XXXX 's XXXX was a banking holiday at the time. 

Furthermore, I wasn't alerted to imminent default or that my account had become default after the fact. Allegedly, according to the rep I'd spoken with from Citizen 's Bank Asset Recovery Department, this was because my account had somehow been listed for a cease and desist without my approval. The last time I'd spoken with anyone from either XXXX or Citizens, as denoted BY XXXX was shortly after my XX/XX/XXXX payment and I did not request a cease-and-desist at that time. I may have even requested someone contact me to ensure that funds were received. With such inconsistencies, it wouldn't be in my best interest to LIMIT communication. 

This is the body of a multimedia email I sent the day of my discovery to Citizen 's Recovery Department. After which I supplied further images in HTML format to help ensure no tampering was made to images. I have received NO response. I was told this was the best course of action by an the employee I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX from Citizen 's Recovery Department. 

XXXX Loan Accounts : XXXX - {$16000.00} This one charged off on the XXXX according to citizen 's bank asset recovery department XXXX- {$20000.00} *I 'd also included information about a second loan, refinanced at the same time as the one I have issue with now. Although, I'd been making payments, allegedly they weren't being dispersed properly to the extent shown above. 
At my monthly min rate of about XXXX per account, this differential suggests that I, for some reason, would have skipped nearly 7 months of payments on one account ( difference of ~ {$4000.00} / $ XXXX monthly payment = ~ XXXX. I believe the other account went default in XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX is ~5 months ). 
Our online payment interface and statements thru my servicer, XXXX, would not inform me of this, even if it was the case. And, no service worker did so until my account had gone into default. In fact, I was told confidently several times by employees on overdue balance calls that """" ANY '' payments towards my balance would be helpful. I proceeded as advised and it led to my 1st account being default. Conveniently, I hadn't thought to record those calls, and XXXX refuses to investigate further. Although, XXXX does record calls for quality assurance & training purposes, as most call centers do in modern day.","","CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.","PA","19141","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-21,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8387517,2024

2024-01-25,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","I received my first post-COVID-forbearance bill for MOHELA for my student loans on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$150.00}, due XX/XX/XXXX. I paid my bill on XX/XX/XXXX. I then applied for loan consolidation ( as I am working toward XXXX XXXX XXXX, and was told the limited waiver could result in a higher count of qualified payments made ). I completed the consolidation application, which included my application for the XXXX income-based repayment program ( I was previously in the REPAYE program ) at this time, toward the end of XX/XX/XXXX. I did not receive a billing statement from MOHELA in XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received by email a """" repayment schedule and disclosure agreement '' but as the consolidation had not finished processing, I could not login to MOHELA 's website because it stated that I did not have an account associated with them. On XX/XX/XXXX I received by email a """" consolidation payment received '' notification, but MOHELA still did not recognize me as an account holder for them. I did not receive a billing statement in XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received via email a billing statement which showed a past due amount of {$490.00}, which does not show a prior billing date. This billing statement included the XX/XX/XXXX due payment of an additional {$490.00}, so my total bill was {$990.00}. This showed that my payment schedule was the """" Standard '' or """" Level '' payment schedule, not the XXXX I had applied for or prior REPAYE income-based payment. My account showed as XXXX, although again, I had not received a billing statement since the XX/XX/XXXX bill, which I paid XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted MOHELA 's customer service for this issue on XX/XX/XXXX and after waiting an XXXX  to reach a XXXX XXXX XXXX, was told that my account should have been placed in XXXX  due to incorrect billing in XXXX, as I was not billed at least XXXX XXXX before my due date. As my account was delinquent from the incorrectly billed """" XXXX '' balance, I asked that this be corrected. I was transferred to another customer service representative who reviewed my account for about XXXX XXXX before telling me he could """" see the issue, but didn't know how to resolve it. '' He offered to request a forbearance, including an administrative XXXX  for correction, to end XX/XX/XXXX. I asked him to please make that request. My account was then placed in delinquency XXXX  until XX/XX/XXXX, followed by an administrative XXXX  ending XX/XX/XXXX. Due to the issues with billing, at this time I contacted the XXXX  for the Department of Education and was told by a representative there that I would need to file a complaint on the studentaid.gov website, and should received a response within XXXX business XXXX. I filed that complaint on XX/XX/XXXX, including multiple documents with the history of billing/communication from MOHELA. To this date, I have yet to receive any response to that complaint, which is still listed as """" pending. '' On XX/XX/XXXX I received information for an """" income-contingent repayment plan XXXX ' '' for a repayment plan of {$620.00} per XXXX. To be clear, this is HIGHER than the prior standard payment amount of {$490.00}. I therefore call MOHELA XX/XX/XXXX and spend almost XXXX XXXX  on hold, was finally put through to a XXXX XXXX XXXX, who told me that was """" just the payment amount due until the XXXX application is done processing. '' I asked if she could explain how that XXXX amount was determined, given that it is higher than the standard repayment. She said she didn't know. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and was put on a call list. The supervisor called me XX/XX/XXXX and reviewed the XXXX plan of {$620.00} per XXXX, and said that he also could not see on what income that was based. He escalated the issue up to be resolved """" within XXXX business XXXX  '' including processing of the XXXX application which """" should resolve all of this. '' On XX/XX/XXXX my payment plan was changed back to the standard, now in the amount of XXXX XXXXXXXX. My SAVE application from XX/XX/XXXX has still not been processed, and my administrative forbearance now ends XX/XX/XXXX, with that {$840.00} due XX/XX/XXXX. The Dept of Ed has never contacted me to assist with this complaint, since it was filed XX/XX/XXXX. MOHELA is unavailable on XXXX  and XXXX, so I have to take time out of work to call. I have never had a wait time shorter than XXXX XXXX, and XXXX  was disconnected after an hour and had to call back to wait yet another hour to be connected to a XXXX 
MOHELA still shows an overdue interest charge to my account from the """" XXXX  '' payment I was never billed for. I did request and receive a letter from MOHELA stating they would not report this XXXX, as it's the result of improper billing, to any credit unions/agencies. So far, my credit report does not have a negative remark on it from that delinquency. 
To date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) none of the issues outlined above have been corrected, other than the XXXX  I was placed on. Due to the timeline for XXXX  being near its end, I will AGAIN have to call MOHELA to request an extension of the XXXX  until they process my XXXX application and the correct payment plan is in place. As a taxpaying XXXX, I am concerned to have to deal with the amount of stress associated with each incorrect, and higher, billed amount which seems to be the result of MOHELA ( a government XXXX which therefore receives some funding via taxpayer dollars ) having absolutely no quality assurance process for billing whatsoever. I am also concerned with the lack of response from the equally XXXX Dept of Education . I work XXXX, and am having to repeatedly step away from my job duties to try to resolve this issue as there is not XXXX XXXX XXXX outside my working XXXX.

At that time, my employment certification has me at 113 payments, with the last 7 months not being certified. I submitted my employment certification for forgiveness on XX/XX/XXXX. I received a response on XX/XX/XXXX that it was going to be processed in 30 days. At the end of 30 days, I called as nothing had happened. The person on the line said there was a hold up and it would be 45 days total. When I called at 45 days, I received an answer that my application never went through but they would process it in 60 days. Every time I called back was a wildly different answer and over 2+ hours on hold. One day, I was on for 4+ hours. Someone tried to say my counts were off because I was a very recently acquired loan with MOHELA, but they have had them for over 2 years, meaning this was blatantly false. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter stating I do not qualify for forgiveness. I logged in and saw they rolled back my qualifying payments to 42 qualifying. The dates they counted are sporadic and include some of the most recent months. When I asked today about it, I was told it wasn't their job at MOHELA to count the payments, and there was no solution or timeframe for my issue being resolved. When asked if it could be months or years, I was told it might be and that I just need to keep making minimum payments. This feels as if MOHELA is grossly negligent with my loans and incapable of properly processing them for forgiveness. After passing up multiple better paying job opportunities to stick with PSLF, they have picked up the finish line and moved it far beyond my reach with no directions on how to get there. I'm an frustrated and so far have no guidance on next steps other than to wait, seemingly for years. This is completely unacceptable and a drain on my finances and valuable time. It also has prevented me from looking for better employment, as moving on before forgiveness could cause issues if they have not completed my forgiveness. What's worse. The debt that should be forgiven could be a potential block to obtaining a mortgage for my family 's first home, which would force us to rent and lose money in the long run.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","MO","63304","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-24,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8211927,2024

2024-01-31,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","Mohela has failed to communicate important and accurate information in a timely manner. Mohela student loans were put into forbearance due to the covid pandemic from XX/XX/XXXX- XX/XX/XXXX. I received communication stating that loans would go back into repayment starting XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore, I made a payment of {$21000.00} that went through on XX/XX/XXXX. In XXXX and XXXX I continued to get notifications and billing statements that stated that monthly student loan payments were due. I made multiple attempts to pay those bills. However, each time I would make a payment I would be notified that my financial institution returned my payment due to No account/ unable to locate. I continued to get notifications that my account was past due. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email that stated Your account has been placed into an administrative forbearance ( meaning no payment is required ) for payments due between XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. You are not required to make a payment until XX/XX/XXXX This was the first time I was notified that my account was in forbearance. Which means I was notified after the forbearance period was over. 

Had I known that my account was in forbearance I would not have made the {$21000.00} payment. I also would have not attempted to make any further payments during that time. In addition, Mohela also shows inaccurate information when I try to view my PSLF qualifying payments online. I wouldnt have made the {$21000.00} payment if I knew that the number of PSLF eligible payments was inaccurate on my account when I view it online. 

Repayment has again restarted in XX/XX/XXXX. I attempted to make a payment on XX/XX/XXXX. The payment was again returned to me and I received the same message that my payment was returned for the same reason of No account/ unable to locate. I continue to receive notifications that my account is overdue despite multiple efforts to pay it. I spoke to an agent on the phone on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that a supervisor would call me back. I spoke to a supervisor on XX/XX/XXXX and she could not determine what the issue was. I was told they would investigate it further and call back within 7-10 business days. Meanwhile, my account is still accruing interest and Im unable to make any payments. I would like all payments made from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX to be returned to me. I was given misleading and false information. These issues can never be resolved due to long call wait times, and processing errors and delays.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","MO","63090","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-31,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8260642,2024

2024-01-03,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Mohela to inquire about why the months of XXXX and XXXX ( XXXX ) are marked as ineligible payments towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ). The agent I spoke to stated that it is due to being placed on Forbearance. I stated that I received a letter stated I was placed on """" Administrative Forbearance '' and on my dash board it stated these would count towards PSLF qualifying payments. The agent stated I was actually placed on """" Processing Forbearance '' and not actually """" Administrative '' despite the fact I got a letter stating it was Administrative. I then informed the agent that I contacted them back in XXXX when I was first placed on this forbearance and requested to be taken off to which she responded she sees this on the notes but does not know why I was not taken off. I then told her that why was I placed on forbearance for that long when they were not processing anything she continuously gave me the run around stating that I was no longer on forbearance and can make two more payment which would count towards PSLF. I informed her that was incorrect due to not meeting the requirements of needing to be on a qualified IDR/ IBR plan. She reported that I did not need to be on XXXX and to go ahead and make these payments in XXXX and XXXX to meet the 120 qualifying payments. I asked the agent why was I denied for the IDR request and she reported that it was due to my income and family size, which is a mistake as another agent explained to me back in XXXX. I applied for income contingent repayment which did not have any limitations to income or family size. She then stated she is unsure. I told her that when I spoke to someone in XXXX they stated they would re-process the request but now it is just showing it got cancelled, even though my account on Student aid states it was approved. Mohela placed me on a standard payment plan instead of the payment plan I requested which they cancelled for no apparent reason. The agent stated she didn't know why it was cancelled and continued to tell me that from here on out I should not have any issues and if I make the last two payments I would be good and will meet the 120 PSLF qualifying payments to receive forgiveness. Had they not deceived me or processed my request to be taken off this forbearance I would have already met the 120 qualifying payments. I have proof of letters, screen shots of my dashboards and a recording from our conversation yesterday stating all the misinformation I received. I have worked hard to meet these sturn requirements just to be misinformed and cheated on when these could have been fixed on their end due to their own mistakes.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","OR","97123","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-03,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8098826,2024

My XXXX, sick, veteran grandfather was trying to spend his money as a gift to pay off my last student loan and this is how mohela mishandled his money. 
My dad called mohela in XXXX to get payoff balance, address to mail a check, and account number to write on the check to pay off my last student loan. They mailed a check in XXXX to Mohela for my loan # XXXX Mohela cashed this check on XX/XX/XXXX but never applied it to my loan. We called numerous times and spent hours on the phone. We have been told numerous stories. We were told by a supervisor that they would be applying to the correct account in 10 days. Didn't happen. Then we told they just needed our proof from the bank that showed mohela cashed it - we sent that documentation. We were told at one time that there was record on one of my accounts ( had a precious fed loan account that was forgiven due to PSLF ) that the check was sent to the wrong address but that in the record they could see mohela told them the wrong address when they called in XXXX. Apparently the check was sent to a location that only dealt with fed loans so could not apply the money to my FFEL loan. Since then mohela claims there is no record that my family was given the wrong address. We have now been told the documentation was submitted for refund on XX/XX/XXXX and we should get it within 90 days. I have filed numerous XXXX complaints to get to this point. It has been more than 90 days and we have no refund. I filled a complaint with federal student aid and they stated mohela told them I would get a refund 30-45 days after XX/XX/2023. Still we have no refund. I am continuing to have to pay interest and make monthly payments because mohela had mishandled our money.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","MO","657XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8105937,2024

2024-01-04,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I am writing to formally complain about the continuous and unresolved issues I have been facing with my federal student loan repayment plan. Despite repeated communications and assurances, my account has not been updated to the Extended Repayment Plan as requested, causing significant financial strain and distress. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Mohela to request a change from the Standard Repayment Plan ( $ XXXX ) to the Extended Repayment Plan ( approximately $ XXXX ). I was assured that the request would be processed. However, despite following up in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, I am still on the Standard Plan, paying $ XXXX since the student loan pause ended. 

Each call involves a considerable time commitment, averaging 2 hours, only to be informed repeatedly that my request is being processed. On XX/XX/XXXX, after an extended call and a transfer to an account specialist, the call was disconnected without resolution. This pattern of unaddressed requests and lack of accountability is unacceptable. 

As a new XXXX with a child to support, the difference of around {$230.00} in monthly payments significantly impacts my financial situation. I have made more than five attempts to resolve this issue, all of which have been unsuccessful. 

I urge Mohela to take immediate action to : 1 ) Review and update my repayment plan to the Extended Plan as initially requested. 

2 ) Provide a detailed explanation of the delays and a clear timeline for resolution.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","GA","30601","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8104916,2024

I do not know why the loans have those statuses, I never requested that they be in a grace period or forbearance period. I want them to all be in repayment status so that I am making qualified PSLF payments towards those loans. 

I have called Mohela twice about changing the status of these loans to a repayment status, once in XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX.

So I have essentially been working for a state agency for the last 7 months yet none of that time will count towards PSLF because Mohela refuses to change the status of my loans, statuses which, again, I never requested in the first place.

I just want them to change all of my loans to repayment status so that I can be making qualified PSLF payments, and I am frustrated that the last 7 months of time I have been working for a public agency are not counting towards my loan forgiveness.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","MT","59601","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-03,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8277018,2024

2024-02-03,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Problem with customer service","This is the second complaint I have had to file, so it's still based on my first complaint. Though MOHELA responded to the first complaint filed with CFPB, that is they approved my new SAVE plan for XXXX per month ( see first compliant ), they never sent me any statements that the payment was due, but instead sent me a bill for over {XXXX}. As I noted prior, in the prior complaint, I don't owe that money because I applied for the SAVE plan because I could not afford the XXXX}. 

After the first complain was filed, MOHELA never adjusted my payment to XXXX} per month, which was supposed to start in XX/XX/XXXX. I made several attempts to contact MOHELA, but there is no way through their system. We can only call ( no chats, no messages ) and there is a labyrinth of confusing menus which seemed designed to prevent people from calling. I waited but could not get through. I then faxed a letter to MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX ( see attached letter 1 ). MOHELA did respond via snail mail with a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. In that letter ( also attached letter 2 ), they admitted that they made a mistake and that the over {$1800.00} should have been taken off my account. I should only owe the {XXXX} per month. They asked me to wait """" three to four business days '' for a change. That was XX/XX/XXXX. 

It is XX/XX/XXXX. They have not fixed my payment. I have been making {$1.00} payments even though they do not send me bills for that amount. They keep mailing me that I am in default, that I am 72+ days behind. I tried to contact them but can not. Then on XX/XX/XXXX, I get a call in the morning from a MOHELA representative. I think her name was XXXX. She called me to say I am over 72 days late on my payment. I explained to her the situation. She looked up my account and said she found the letter, the faxed one, I just sent you. She apologized and said she would need to get her supervisor to fix the situation. After waiting for over 20 minutes and put on hold four or five times, she came back and told me that the supervisor would fix it. I asked her if I would get a message that confirms we had the conversation. She said that I would. As of XX/XX/XXXX, not only is that no trace I had this conversation with her, but the supervisor never handled my account or fixed it. This was supposed to be fixed in early XXXX of last year! On XX/XX/XXXX, I get a call from MOHELA to collect my debt of {XXXX. 

This is beyond maddening. I am probably in the top ten in student loan debt in this country, and yet not matter what I do, I feel that this is deliberate, that the company is trying to frustrate its customers because it just does not make any sense. I was put on a payment plan last year for XXXX and have yet to get a statement or bill that reflects that amount because they won't take off the XXXX  that they agreed to in writing. I have no way of contacting them without taking a day off from work because waits are so long, but then when I finally get a human being, they don't do what they say they are going to do. 

At this point, I am speaking to an attorney about a class action lawsuit because that is no excuse for this and many of us are having the same problem. We should not be at fault because the company can not handle the volume of customers.

2024-01-21,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I was under an income-based repayment plan that averaged about {$250.00} per month in payments, for years. Last year I applied for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. My loans were transferred from XXXX to Mohela. Loan payments began last XXXX following the end of covid pause. No problems with XXXX payment, the normal {$250.00} was debited from my account. 
However, on XX/XX/XXXX Mohela, with no authorization and no explanation, auto-debited {$6800.00} from my account, causing it to be overdrafted. I discovered this on XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately called Mohela. I asked them what happened and requested a refund, agreeing to a refund of the amount minus my XXXX monthly payment. They did not provide an explanation, only asking if I authorized someone else to have access to my account, which I have not. They agreed to a refund and stated it would take XXXX days to process. 
The next week on XX/XX/XXXX I called Mohela again to confirm the refund was being processed, which was confirmed. However, the account person blamed the large auto-debit on my failure to renew my income-based repayment plan. I asked for an email in writing confirming the refund. The account person agreed, then did not include that language in the email I received. 
I patiently waited for my refund to be processed. I remember seeing a national story sometime during this time which is when I learned I was not the only person this had happened to. The article stated that everyone affected would have their accounts put in forbearance until the issue was cleared up. I checked my account online and confirmed my account had been placed in forbearance. The article stated that months in forbearance would count toward loan repayment. 
I became suspicious again when I received emails from Mohela regarding not paying my XXXX and XXXX loan payments. But I dismissed them, believing my account was still in forbearance while my refund was being processed. On one weekend in XXXX I checked my account online and realized my account was taken off forbearance. I still had not received my refund. On the morning of XX/XX/XXXX I called Mohela again and was told that my refund was not going to be processed because it was determined to be an """" impermissible refund '' but that the XXXX payment would be applied to future loan payments. I had not been notified of this decision by Mohela, and as stated earlier if that was the case, why was I receiving emails regarding not making loan payments in XXXX and XXXX? During the XX/XX/XXXX phone call I asked to speak with a supervisor. I waited on hold for more than XXXX minutes, and no supervisor came to the phone. I was put in a callback system that stated a supervisor would call me back the same day. I never received a phone call. 
Later that same day on XX/XX/XXXX my wife called Mohela on my behalf and spoke to a different account representative. She was given different information about my account. This time, Mohela stated that only XXXX XXXX of mine was put into forbearance. The original refund request from XXXX was cancelled and Mohela 's accounting had created a new refund request on XX/XX/14. My loans are now in overdue status because of no payment. They also stated for the first time that the entire payment from XXXX had to be refunded and they could not do partial refunds. My wife again left her number for a supervisor to call back, to an automated callback system that promises a supervisor will call you back on the same day. She never received a call back. 
At this point I believe Mohela has committed grand theft- they have lied, failed to provide me information, and given conflicting information every time I call. They are refusing to refund my money and I no longer trust anything they say to me. I didn't attach any documents to this complaint but I can provide documented proof of everything, including screenshots of my bank account and phone showing call history should that be necessary.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","FL","33463","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-21,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8196301,2024

2024-03-05,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Struggling to repay your loan","Problem with your payment plan","My loan servicer for PSLF is MOHELA. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted my IDR application for the new SAVE plan, in addition, on XX/XX/XXXX I paid {$300.00} for my bill that was to be due on XX/XX/XXXX. 

In XXXX, I saw that my account was put into XXXX  while my new IDR application was being processed. I called and was told at the time that the money I paid for the XX/XX/XXXX bill would be applied to my next bill, and that my XXXX would end on XX/XX/XXXX, to be paid for the first bill on XX/XX/XXXX, and the money paid for XXXX would be applied to the XX/XX/XXXX bill once my plan was recalculated. 

When I checked in XXXX to see if my plan had been recalculated, it was marked as still processing, though I had a non-IDR bill due for over {$800.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I called in and they told me that it was a mistake, and that my accounts would be put in administrative forbearance until my IDR was processed, and that it is taking a long time currently. They extended my XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. 

When I checked in again in XXXX to see if my plan had been recalculated, it still had not, and I called in again, and was placed on yet another administrative XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. 

During each of these calls, I was reassured that the months of forbearance would count toward my PSLF, as the need for XXXX was not my fault. 

I checked in, again, in XXXX, and saw that my bill would be {$500.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX, though some loans were still in XXXX while others were not and my IDR application was still processing. I called in again, and they re-opened and re-submitted the application that I had sent in on XX/XX/XXXX so that it could be processed again, and told me that if nothing had happened within 10 business days, to call back and be put on XXXX again until it was re-calculated. 

After 10 business days, the IDR application still had not yet processed, and the bill was due XX/XX/XXXX. I called in again on XX/XX/XXXX, and finally reached someone who could help me. They let me know that they will add a XXXX to my account until XX/XX/XXXX, and that my bill on XX/XX/XXXX would be {$300.00} as my IDR was almost completed or had just been processed but my account had not yet been updated in the online system. I clarified that the extra month of XXXX would still count toward my PSLF, and they told me yes, and then I asked if the money I had paid in XXXX of XXXX would be counting toward my XX/XX/XXXX bill and they also said yes. I clarified again that I would have nothing due on XX/XX/XXXX, and they said that nothing would be due as I would be on XXXX 

I checked my account today, and I have an overdue bill from XX/XX/XXXX for {$500.00} and a bill due on XX/XX/XXXX for {$300.00}. 

Not only was my account not put into forbearance, so it looks as though I missed a payment, the {$300.00} that I had paid in XXXX was not applied to my XXXX bill. My credit history is perfect - I have never missed a car or credit card payment to date and I am furious that their incompetence will leave a mark on my record. In addition, I am incredibly unhappy that it seems my payment from XX/XX/XXXX has been lost. 

Finally, MOHELA has been impossible to reach, each time I called in XXXX, I would wait on hold for over an hour, just to reach someone and be told that they couldn't help and that the next person who could help me would be about a 2-3 hour wait. They told me to call back in the mornings as wait times are less, which is a nice idea in theory, but I do work in an elementary school and can not just leave my students to fend for themselves while I wait endlessly on hold. I was able to reach someone the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, and this is when I believed all issues to have been resolved.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","MD","20814","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-05,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8478399,2024

I keep getting billing errors, and conflicting information from representatives and supervisors when I call to fix these errors which are making it impossible to fix!!!! On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I paid {$270.00} for my XXXX and XXXX billing cycles ( respectively ). Totaling {$540.00}. Due to issues Mohela incorrectly billing, I was informed XXXX billing would be put in administrative forbearance and I could have the payments I had made could be applied to future payments. On XX/XX/XXXX, I paid another XXXX for my XXXX billing. I also submitted for my new XXXX plan which was set to expire. mohela eventually placed me in another administrative forbearance for processing. I also called in XXXX to have the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payments applied to XXXX, XXXX, and the balance to XXXX under my new XXXX payments. When I was later billed for XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX, I called on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative was unable to find the error and had my request a call back from a supervisor. I received a call from a supervisor the following day ( her named was XXXX? ). She wasnt sure why I was being billed. She saw the account said those payments were applied but couldnt see what it was applied to. She would mark it as paid ahead and submit another request which would take XXXX days. On XX/XX/XXXX, the payments still were not applied to XX/XX/XXXX payment. I called again and spoke to the supervisor XXXX, who would expedite the request so that the bill would be fixed in a few days. He said if it wasnt fixed by XXXX, I should call the supervisor line again and ask for a call back. On XXXX, I still had a bill due XXXX for XXXX, so I called the supervisor line and heard back from XXXX. XXXX said it had been reviewed on XXXX, and that the reason why im still being billed for XXXX is that it had been determined that those payments could not be applied to XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX since I was now under a new XXXX payment plan and so it wasnt the same initial plan I had paid towards. I would have to pay my bill due XXXX since it was a different plan. I paid this bill for XXXX immediately on as soon as I got off the phone. While I was still on the phone, I asked XXXX if that money I had paid on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX could never be applied under my new XXXX payment, would it be refunded? She put in a refund request and said it would take XXXX days. NOW that I have paid the XXXX bill for XXXX and asked for the refund form the XXXX and XXXX payments, I can see that XXXX was completely wrong!!! The XXXX I paid in XXXX WAS applied to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX! But now Ive paid an extra XXXX bill when I shouldnt not have AND there is a refund request that isnt needed since it was applied to later dates. This is beyond a confusing mess, and I worry about how XXXX inability to keep track of information so supervisors can properly advise people is making paying bills confusing and could potentially mess up the payment counts for my PSLF!

On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted my next round of XXXX  forms. I realized around this time that I had several payments from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX ( from here on, referred to as """" XXXX payments '' ) that were not counted as qualifying payments.

2024-03-11,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I continue to face two issues with MOHELA that I can not get resolved. I have tried to call them at least a dozen times but never get any resolution and have only spoken to a representative once or twice and they can't figure out what is wrong with my account. Typically when I call the wait time is over an hour and I will request a call back but they never call back. My two main issues are as follows : 1 ) I am, and have been, enrolled in auto-debit but the loans do not reflect the .25 % reduction in interest rate and continue to accrue at the higher rate. I have sent MOHELA messages asking that they update my loans to reflect the proper rate and refund me for the unlawful accrual at the higher interest rate. 

2 ) The amount owed monthly vs. the amount that auto-debit withdraws vs. another amount MOHELA states I owe are all different amounts and I can not get a straight forward answer of how much my actual payment is each month. I have no idea if I am overpaying, underpaying, or paying the correct amount. In XXXX, the MOHELA account overview said I owed {$370.00} on XX/XX/24 but on the same page it says auto-debit will withdraw {$430.00} on XX/XX/24 ( I do not have auto-debit paying any extra per month so this amount should reflect my payment method ) and further down on the same page it says I owe $ XXXX. Currently the MOHELA account overview now says I owe {$300.00} on XX/XX/24, but it says auto-debit will withdraw {$430.00} on XX/XX/24, and again further down on the same page it says I owe $ XXXX. 

There is over {$100.00} difference between these numbers with no explanation as to what is the correct number and why there is a discrepancy. I have attempted to call MOHELA many times but the one time I talked with someone they said something was messed up with my account and to wait until the payment posted ( which I did ). I do not believe MOHELA is providing an accurate accounting because they are providing literally three different accountings of what is owed and can not articulate which one is correct.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","NY","11216","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-11,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8523493,2024

According the the federal Student Aid website, if your recertification falls before XX/XX/XXXX, all recertification dates should be pushed back by a year. 

I have called and spoken to various representatives at MOHELA, and many of them tell me that I no longer qualify for the pushback because XX/XX/XXXX is a """" soft date '' and my actual recertification is sometime in XXXX. However, nothing on their website indicates this date on my account nor in any paperwork issued to me. About a month ago, another date ( in addition to the XX/XX/XXXX date ) popped up on my account as recertification required by XX/XX/XXXX. No one I speak with on the phone knows what this date is or can comment on why it's now on my account. This date would also make me ineligible for the one year pushback. 

Not only this, but when I emailed them about this issue on XX/XX/XXXX they did not respond until XX/XX/XXXX with """" we see you spoke to a customer representative and have resolved this issue '' although it was never resolved. MOHELA has not provided timely services nor are they providing accurate information as each representative I talk to has wildly different information or advice.

Since that time I've been told that I do qualify for the pushback, that I do not qualify for the pushback, and that I """" might """" qualify but I have to wait until XX/XX/XXXX to know for sure ( and if it is not fixed, they estimate my payment will become {$5000.00} a month which is not something I can afford. Lastly, they are not honoring what is posted on the federal student aid website, nor honoring dates indicated on paperwork they issued to me on their letterhead. 

There are many, many others with this same issue.

2024-03-01,"Student loan","Private student loan","Getting a loan","Loan opened without my consent or knowledge","In XXXX of XXXX I went into the XXXX XXXX Citizens bank branch with the intention to refinance my private student loan that I share with my dad from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$45000.00}. I had this intention specifically because my father was attempting to manipulate me financially using this loan we share. I had spoken to a third party financial advisor prior to this meeting and I was educated and aware of the difference between federal and private loans and had clear intentions for what I wanted to do. I went into the branch with a document pertaining to my private loan and asked the banker to refinance that loan. 

I spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX. She asked me to provide her with the documents from my federal loans. When I asked her why she needed those documents, she told me that she needed them to have a complete picture of my debt history. So I went home and provided her with that documentation. After that, she asked once again for my private loan documentation. I provided that promptly. Shortly thereafter, I received an email telling me everything was all set and the loan offer was sent to me. I signed it without a second thought believing I was refinancing my private student loan. This is because I had asked her to refinance my private loans and I had never asked her to refinance my federal loans. She never once mentioned that she was refinancing my federal student loans. I believe this is illegal under the Truth in Lending Act, which requires lenders to disclose all information about their loans. Citizens gave me misleading information about the loan I signed. 

Then on XX/XX/XXXX when my payments began, I noticed that the loan information was not correct. I immediately called the Citizens student loan phone number and discovered this catastrophic mistake. The position this puts me in is extremely bad for me. What this means is that I'm expected to pay XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Citizens around XXXX $ a month total, and I'm expected to be in these loans for at least the next 20 years. It also means that I do not have access to federal programs such as debt forgiveness and income driven repayment. It also significantly negatively impacts my credit. There is no logical way that someone would make this choice on purpose. 

I immediately asked for help from Citizens, and they told me to call my former federal loan servicer, XXXX. They refused to help me. So I called Citizens back, at which time they told me my case was already under investigation. On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to someone from the office of the chair saying there wasn't anything they could do to help me if the federal loan servicer was unwilling to return the money. She also told me that they were doing an internal investigation on the loan and the branch colleague who helped me. When I asked her to provide me with the outcome of that investigation, she told me I would not have access to that information. 

My next step was in XXXX. I called the student loan phone number again, this time looking to see if forbearance was an option in the meantime while I tried to sort out this mess. I was told that I could not have complete forbearance, that I could have a modified payment for a short time frame. I was also told I would not be able to consolidate my debt if my loan was in forbearance. I decided to look for more options of how to address this problem but to keep that in mind in the meantime. I also asked about minimum payments due to prevent any kind of delinquency, and they told me the minimum amount was {$320.00}. 

During this time I began dealing with harassment from my dad who I share the XXXX XXXX XXXX with. This caused me to have XXXX XXXX  struggles that have made it harder for me to act quickly and also it has caused me to take XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and seek out a XXXX XXXX against him and his abuse. This has been time consuming and debilitating. 

My next step after that was to try to get in touch with the office of the chair again. I was begging for some resolution. I began corresponding with XXXX from the office of the chair in XXXX. XXXX 's only solution for me was to suggest debt consolidation. The last time we spoke she requested loan documentation from my XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX. 

Loan consolidation is not an attractive option to me because it still doesn't fix the biggest problem with all of this : I was eligible for debt forgiveness and income driven repayment when this was a federal loan. So in the meantime I sought out other options. I called the department of education again to see if they could help me or advise me on any steps I could take. This time they elevated my case to the office of the ombudsman. I had to wait for their response to my complaint. They responded by saying that if Citizens won't resolve this for me, I should write up a complaint to this consumer protections agency. 

In the meantime, without any notice Citizens has cleaned out my entire checking and savings accounts a day before my rent is due. From my checking they took {$1900.00}, and from my savings they took {$8700.00}. I was never informed that this would be a consequence and I was under the impression that this loan was under investigation. I believe this violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act because this loan is currently under investigation and should be frozen from debt collection. I believe it also violates the Truth in Lending Act because it was never disclosed to me that this was a possible consequence of not paying into the loan. 

I am currently in continued conversations with the office of the chair at Citizens to get this rectified, but I am reaching out to you for your aid because they haven't been able to help me find a solution. 

Attached is a transcript of the conversation I had with a financial advisor before I went in to refinance my private loan, screenshots of my email with XXXX, and a screenshot proving that I had just signed up for the income driven repayment program with my federal loans before they were fraudulently refinanced.","","CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.","MA","02155","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-01,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",8458717,2024

I noticed a couple months later that the PSLF application had been processed however my account says employment was not certified from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. I called in XX/XX/XXXX and was told by a Mohela representative that this would be a """" fast fix of 3-5 business days '' after the reviewed my PSLF application which shows my employment with the XXXX XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and explained the situation to a Mohela representative.

On XX/XX/XXXX I noticed that my account shows my PSLF application submitted on XX/XX/XXXX as a duplicate. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and was told again that it would be a """" fast fix of 3-5 business days ''. This has clearly not been the case. I am working to keep up my employment verification on a regular basis and Mohela is failing the consumer and their Federal contract by not processing PSLF application correctly. 

In addition, I wrote to Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX and stated : Two of my loans ( DL Consolidation Subsidized & DL Consolidation Unsubsidized ) show that I have an additional qualified payment from XX/XX/XXXX while my other loans do not reflect XX/XX/XXXX. I believe this is an error as I was in repayment at that time and qualified for PSLF ( as my most recent PSLF form will show ).

On XX/XX/XXXX I was notified that my account would be be put in administrative forbearance from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX to process my IDR application ( email attached ). I had not requested administrative forbearance and was eager to start my loan payment in XX/XX/XXXX since I am working towards PSLF. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was notified that there had been a change to my account and that I had a scheduled monthly payment for XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$42.00} ( email attached ). 

In late XX/XX/XXXX I called Mohela and asked why I had a payment due of {$42.00} if my account was in administrative forbearance. Upon digging, I found that loan 1 of my 10 loans was not in administrative forbearance. I was told by the Mohela representative that this was clearly an error that one of the loans was not in administrative forbearance. At that point my IDR application has been approved in early XXXX and I asked if I could make a payment on all of my loans for XX/XX/XXXX since I am working towards PSLF. I was told that would not be possible since 9 out of 10 of my loans were in administrative forbearance that I had not requested and Mohela would not be able to change my account forbearance for the month of XX/XX/XXXX. I was told that the payment of {$42.00} would be processed and then I could call to get it refunded since this was an error as all of my other loans were in administrative forbearance. 

Mohela refunded the amount of {$42.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a """" friendly reminder '' that XXXX due date has been missed. Since then I have received reminders from Mohela and XXXX Department of Education that I have missed payments. I have called Mohela XXXX times about this issue and each time I'm told that this is an error and to ignore the late payment reminders. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a response from Mohela regarding another issue I had about PSLF qualifying payment counts with a response that my account is currently 20 days delinquent with a past due amount of {$260.00} ( email attached ). On XX/XX/XXXX I called Mohela and spent over XXXX hours on the phone just to be told to ignore the email sent on XX/XX/XXXX about the past due amount of {$260.00} and that it was a mistake. The representative said they could see a late amount of {$42.00}. When I explained everything above, the issue was escalated to a specialist who did nothing in the two hours and I was ultimately told to ignore all late notifications NOT to pay the {$42.00} and that the issue would be corrected in 45 business days. I then confirmed that my account would still show delinquent and that I would continue to receive emails that I am delinquent on my Federal student loans. I was told this would be the case until the issue is resolved by Mohela. 

I am a XXXX employee who is working towards PSLF and who has never paid a bill late. This is ridiculous that I have been subjected to the stress and time I have had to spend on trying to make my student loan payments on time and ultimately work towards PSLF.

If Mohela will not respond to emails then the ability to contact them by email should be XXXX on the Mohela website to avoid wasting time waiting on a response that will not be coming. I was worried about my XXXX payment being past due and how it would impact my credit profile. I called Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX, after waiting on hold a very long time I was able to talk to a representative. I explained what had happened and the rep decided to redo the XXXX XXXX application with me on the phone. I had my tax returns and student loan info and provided this for the rep to complete the application. After completing the application, the rep said my payment on this program should be {$160.00} and asked if that would be acceptable. I said yes, that is what I was expecting but my payment instead had been increased to {$750.00}. The rep was puzzled by this. I asked if my loan could be placed in forbearance until the payment could be corrected. The rep replied yes and placed my loan in forbearance until the XXXX XXXX application could be processed and the payment corrected. I had been checking my account on line and noticed toward end of XX/XX/XXXX that my loan was no longer in forbearance but my payment due for XX/XX/XXXX remained the incorrect {$750.00}. I called Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX to discuss this problem. I waited on hold for over an hour and gave up. I sent another email on XX/XX/XXXX from my account page to Mohela again asking for the payment to be corrected and loan placed back in forbearance until it was corrected. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX there has been no response to my email. I am a teacher and work in my classroom all day, I dont have the option to call during what Mohela calls their none peak hours Thursday and Friday mornings, especially when wait times exceed an hour which has been my experience.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","MI","48047","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-09,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8513377,2024

I have been making these payments and reporting income changes in good faith. Couple weeks ago, I made my XXXX payment and was happy to know that I have XXXX payments left. Couple days ago I logged in and noticed that my account has a large negative balance, meaning I overpaid. The account also showed that I have only made XXXX payments so far and have XXXX payments left. 
Astonished, I also reviewed the income reported and it showed that I have not reported any income for any previous months. This is not possible because : XXXX. The website does not allow me to make payments if the income is below {$3300.00} amount. However, I have made payments and the account showed that I had XXXX payments left. Thus, if I did, indeed report {$0.00} income, then I would NOT be able to make these payments. 
XXXX. I called """" customer service '' and it went to voicemail, which never got a reply. All my emails went to scripted responses apologizing for the """" inconvenience '' and telling me I have to keep paying or that I have to fix my mistake for having underreported income, which : a. I do not know what to fix because the amount they claim I under reported is greater than the amount I made that year. For example, they claim I under reported $ XXXX in XXXX. However, as you see from paystubs, I only made -- to the best of my knowledge, less than $ XXXX that year! The only other job I had that year was a job held prior to the begning of the contract, but EVEN if they wrongfully count the income from that job, I only worked part time at $ XXXX so that income would fall UNDER the minimum {$3300.00} at which I have to start making payments per contract ( see attached pay stubs and contract ). 
b. The place they referred me to """" fix '' is not working. There is no link. There is just a greyed out page saying that I under reported the income. 
XXXX. Per the terms of the contract, if I did under report my income, then they need to spread out the under reported amount over the course of the remaining payments left. In this case, I only have XXXX payments to make. I do not understand why they take liberty to just reset my XXXX and make it start from the beginning simply because they allege I under reported my income by an amount larger than total income that year!

2024-02-04,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","In early XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  I checked the status of my loans, which I do at least monthly and discovered that a paid off loan ( # XXXX ) had reappeared as active and at its original loan amount. Additionally, my two remaining accurate active loans ( # XXXX ) ballooned up in the amount owed. Looking further, the ballooned loan totals were because MOHELA removed my XXXX  electronic transfer payments from between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. These payments were visible in the MOHELA loan app the week prior. 

I contacted MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX. They found my payments deep in their system and confirmed that although the payments were received and processed the credit was not applied to my account anymore ( causing the ballooned loan totals for the accurate-active two loans [ XXXX ] ). MOHELA also confirmed that their system shows complete pay off of the erroneously active loan ( # XXXX ), despite it being active and requirement payment again. They sent me a copy of the payoff letter for loan XXXX, as well as a few other previously paid off loans. 

On XX/XX/XXXX a resolutions rep looked at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and confirmed that MOHELA failed to notify the system of my loan payments in full. Therefore the national system is also not accurate. 

Since my initial call MOHELA has put erroneous loan ( # XXXX ) and accurate active loans ( # XXXX ) in payment ( federal injunction should have placed the accurate active loans on forbearance and the erroneous loan shouldn't exist ). Therefore, I am accruing interest and requiring payment on falsely inflated loan totals and I'm being forced to pay ( or be delinquent ) on a loan I paid off long ago. MOHELA is effectively stealing from me and risking negative affects to my credit and taxes. 

I've spoke to MOHELA on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX without resolution. They continue to tell me 7-14 days for full resolution without results. I've waited over 8 hours on hold during these times, costing me at my full-time employment. I would like to receive an accurate pay off total for the two accurately active loans and proof of full payment on all other loans. Additionally, I would like MOHELA to confirm that they have notified the National Student Loan Data System of my payment fulfillment and that they have notified my major credit bureaus of my fulfillment and loan closures. 

MOHELA 's negligence ( or worse ) in handling my loans is financially costing me directly in payments and potentially costing me through the negative affects of the impacts to my credit score and taxes. I've attempted to provide the information and reminders to MOHELA for them to remedy the issues and they fail to.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","UT","84062","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8281893,2024

I applied for the SAVE plan in early XX/XX/2023 about when it went live. It was the plan I selected and I'm well aware both I and my loans qualify for it. I was maintained in the PAYE plan. I applied again shortly after and was again kept in the PAYE plan. I tried emailing them a few times about the issue, got one response that was as helpful as a screen door on a submarine, and have never gotten any further communication. I have also called their customer service multiple times, often waiting for over an hour with no answer and a couple of times the phone would be picked up and hung up almost immediately. My payment would be the same whether in PAYE or SAVE... I'm a social worker, so I make peanuts or whatever nut is worse than peanuts ( which aren't really nuts ). The issue is that the SAVE plan has a feature that forgives interest accrual beyond whatever your payment is so that your balance can stay the same but never increases due to unpaid interest like it does in the PAYE plan. Since I applied for enrollment in the SAVE plan, I have been hit with over {$1000.00} in interest that should not have increased my balance if I was assigned to the correct plan. My previous complaint was closed because I had a pending bankruptcy, which my student loans were not up for discharge regardless. Upon discharge of bankruptcy, Aidvantage updated the account and are charging me a payment amount much higher than the FSA IDR process quoted.

I find calling them to be traumatic. Each time, I end up with a random customer service agent who has to come up to speed on the situation ( 45 min ), I'm on the phone for an hour+, and no one explains what's happening or WHY I'm having trouble. The agents says """" someone will call you, '' but when I say that options doesn't work for me, can we schedule a time over phone or email, they say Mohela doesn't do that. The agents ( now 5+ at least ) can't resolve the issue or have someone schedule a meeting with me ( for example XX/XX/XXXX XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ). Agents I speak with are frustrated on my behalf because they can see in the system ( as can I ) that the forms are listed as received and approved ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ), but I'm still being billed and reported to credit as delinquent. The agents even describe the whole situation as odd because it is like the forms acceptance, despite taking months to approve, and the billing/delinquent system aren't communicating, yet no one on Mohela 's end is figuring it out. There are no letters stating """" this is what isn't working with your form, '' just you're delinquent and being reported. 

In the meantime, they have reported to my credit ( 120 days ). It's my only negative report.

2024-01-03,"Student loan","Private student loan","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","I have private loans through Sallie Mae from when I attended XXXX XXXX  in XXXX XXXX, FL from XXXX or XXXX of XXXX until XXXX of XXXX, which is when I graduated with an XXXX  Degree in XXXX XXXX XXXX 
The first problem was XXXX forcing Sallie Mae down my throat, claiming my requested loan amount couldn't be fully covered by federal loans alone, that I would have to split it between federal and private. I was living on my own in Florida and working as a XXXX  at XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, FL. That job wouldn't pay people a living wage so I unfortunately had to take out more on loans than I wanted to. So, my total requested amount for the entirety of my program ended up equaling to approximately {$60000.00}, approximately {$40000.00} of which went to the actual program. This has all been a domino effect to the circumstances I am enduring to this day. 
I have been continuing to have issues with Sallie Mae practically since day one. Just because I had a cosigner, they wanted me to pay $ XXXX right at graduation. Mind you, most people aren't immediately able to get a job in the field they got a degree in right after graduation. I was only able to pay that amount for a year when I called them and told them I couldn't pay that amount anymore. They kept trying to tell me """" well you have to figure out a way to make it work, '' and I told them I had been and couldn't do it anymore. I stated it multiple times just in that one phone call until they finally decided to offer an alternative. The woman didn't fully inform me of the modified payment plan I had elected, only that each loan ( I have three with them ) would increase by approximately $ XXXX after the year of modified payments was up. She didn't tell me I wouldn't be eligible for other loans or that I couldn't refinance. 
Fast-forward to a year later when my payments increase again, but not only that, interest rates have skyrocketed. My payments are now upwards of $ XXXX. I'm trying to talk to them and get help because I know I won't be able to afford payments like those, being a single income household. My cosigner is also not able to help me. Regardless, they should be making it affordable for the borrower, not the borrower and the cosigner. I try to make some payments while getting this figured out, but they're no help at all. Eventually I stop paying because I can't afford to. Meanwhile, I'm trying to refinance on my own, and with my cosigner, with other places because I know I can't refinance with Sallie Mae. Nothing is working and eventually, my account sinks further and further into debt, hurting me and my cosigner because of Sallie Mae 's ridiculous loan terms. 
Sallie Mae keeps calling and I tell them until they can work with me I can't pay them because I can't afford to. They keep going back and forth with me and trying to back me in a corner. ( They've done this to me and my cosigner frequently. ) I'm adamant and they finally concede and get me to an underwriter to help me with a repayment plan. I make a year of on-time payments of $ XXXX to get my account back on track and after that year is up I can submit an application to release my cosigner and get my loan reevaluated for my income alone. 
Everything seems to be going decent until recently. In XXXX XXXX I knew I wasn't going to be able to make my payment on the due date of the XXXX, but I knew I could pay it by the XXXX when it's considered late. I talked to a man at least three days prior to the processing of the payment, which is their cutoff, about taking off my auto payment. He told me he did it for me and I had nothing to worry about except manually put my payment in by the 14th as stated. A few days pass and I see that a partial payment came out of my account and the rest was backcharged on the XXXX. I look in my Sallie Mae app and my auto debit is still on. I turn it off and manually make the rest of the payment manually on the XXXX. 
Fast forward to XXXX I'm checking my app again to make sure the auto pay is still off and I see my payment due is going to be {$580.00}. I call and speak to a woman named XXXX. I ask where the extra {$20.00} came from and she stated it is an unpaid fee from my payment being back charged. I told her it wasn't my fault and she told me I still had to pay it. I vehemently refused to pay that money when it was not my fault, but the fault of the man I spoke to in XXXX. She kept blowing off what I was saying, but I was not taking the falling and paying {$20.00} for something that was not my fault. I told her I wanted to speak to a supervisor then to have this fee removed from my account. She still blew my off and wouldn't transfer me. I had to say multiple times that I wanted to make sure people listen to this phone call and the previous one then because I refuse to pay it ever. She finally said she could send it to the XXXX XXXX for them to review the case. She gave me a case number and told me not to expect a response for approximately a month and the fee will stay on my account until then. What happens though if I don't pay the {$20.00}? Will my account have a past due delinquency and ruin my repayment plan? I have nine payments done and three left. If I lose my repayment plan because of this, I don't know what I'll do. 
These people are impossible to work with. I wish I had been able to take my whole loan amount out through the federal government because this has been a nightmare, and I'm not the only one. Please look at the XXXX XXXX XXXX reviews. The XXXX  is a joke as well. They state reviews don't go into the grading of the company when customers make a business, and we're not happy. Sallie Mae has assisted in fraud by not helping a woman who had a random man take out a loan for his son under her name and they essentially told her """" too bad, too sad.

The SAVE application has now been processed BUT extra interest has been charged due to Nelnet 's incompetency. This is not a duplicate request but an issue with interest, not my SAVE application** Background : I submitted a SAVE application through StudentAid.gov on XX/XX/XXXX as part of the new beta roll-out. StudentAid.Gov confirmed the completed application and sent this to Nelnet, my loan servicer. No response from Nelnet whatsoever. I re-applied via StudentAid.gov on XX/XX/XXXX again. No response from Nelnet. I applied on Nelnet directly on XX/XX/XXXX. No response. I called Nelnet customer service multiple days throughout late XXXX, averaging 2.5-3 hours on hold. I finally had to re-apply via phone on XX/XX/XXXX. I received notice shortly after that I was approved to be on the SAVE IDR plan, but at a cost that was significantly higher than what I should owe based on my income. In my XXXX taxes, I was earning slightly over XXXX USD/year. I was laid off XX/XX/XXXX. Since my new role in XX/XX/XXXX, I now earn XXXX USD and supplied all documentation to support this with paystubs. No response from Nelnet. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and my information was submitted to correct the problem and I was placed into forbearance and interest is now accruing while my application is stuck. In the first complaint I sent ( XXXX ), the issue with the application has been resolved. 

**NEW ISSUE** : However, because Nelnet took so long to respond, interest accrued during this time when- if my application was processed in due-time prior to payments restarting- I should not have gained ANY interest on my account in accordance with the SAVE plan. Due to Nelnet taking many months to respond to my issues and ignoring any emails and phone calls, I accrued over {$300.00} in interest during this """" admin forbearance '' time when I followed all procedures and policies set forth by the federal government in regards to loan repayments. I demand that Nelnet wave the $ XXXX interest accrued during this period as it was their fault and delay that caused this interest to accrue, not mine.","","Nelnet, Inc.","TX","78613","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-15,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8157056,2024

I applied for loan consolidation to become eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) program and requested placement on the SAVE Plan. However, I have faced numerous issues since then : On XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed that my consolidation was complete, and Mohela would be my new servicer, but I have been repeatedly placed on incorrect payment plans. 

Despite following their instructions and resubmitting the SAVE application five times, I have been placed on the Standard Payment Plan, IBR-C Payment Plan, and now the Level Payment Plan, resulting in monthly payments over {$800.00}, which is significantly higher than what I qualify for under the SAVE Plan. 

Due to Mohela 's errors, I have been placed in forbearance every month from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, causing these months not to count towards my PSLF payments.

I am eligible for the SAVE Plan, and these issues are jeopardizing my ability to have these loans forgiven within a reasonable amount of time and significantly adding to mental stress and anguish.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","PA","183XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-29,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8246465,2024

On XXXXXX/XX/XXXX I attempted to pay the total remaining balance but this payment was reversed and rejected. I made an additional attempt on XXXXXX/XX/XXXX with the same results.

I have since emailed Aidvantage customer service to ( yet again ) request to close out my remaining balance. I have also informed them that I would file a complaint with this office.

2024-02-09,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","To Whom It May Concern, I consolidated my student loans in XX/XX/XXXX and simultaneously applied for the SAVE plan for my new consolidated loan, however when my new loan appeared on Mohela 's website at the end of XXXX it showed I was NOT enrolled in the SAVE plan as I requested, but an Income Contingent Repayment Plan. I called Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with several different agents to try and get back in SAVE and figure out what was going on. One agent told me I """" termed out '' of SAVE because I had been in it for a year ( not true I didn't even know SAVE existed a year ago ). I was also told by another Mohela rep that Mohela 's system said my consolidated loan did not qualify for SAVE. This was also incorrect information as each of the individual loans that were consolidated qualified for SAVE individually and were each enrolled in the SAVE plan previously. The studentaid.gov site also showed me the SAVE plan as an option for the consolidated loan although Mohela 's website and agents did not. After speaking with several different Mohela reps I confirmed that I did not have any parent plus loans and no one could figure out why my consolidated loan wasn't in SAVE as I requested. I was told by one Mohela agent they put me in an XXXX plan for my consolidated loan because that was the """" cheapest plan '' for me, however it is NOT the cheapest plan. SAVE would be the cheapest according to studentaid.gov because my income would qualify for XXXX XXXX/month payments and a NO accrued interest. 
One of the Mohela agents I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX said he could not figure out why I didn't qualify for SAVE, but to save me some money he said the best course of action would be to have me verbally apply with him to open another XXXX plan application right then and include my current income which would lower my bill to {$150.00} per month from {$250.00}. He had me verbally apply to be in XXXX on the phone with him. He also told me to manually fill out an IDR application and upload it to Mohela 's website to be in REPAYE which he said is the old SAVE plan. In all, multiple applications were opened for me.

After speaking with Mohela 's Supervisor XXXX last Saturday she said the agents should have seen my original SAVE application from XXXX for my loan consolidation. This was the first I was even hearing that they had my XXXX application. She told me it takes a while to process SAVE applications and the Mohela agent should not have opened another XXXX application for me as it is delaying my original SAVE application for the consolidated loan from XXXX. Being misled and delay of being in SAVE with XXXX XXXX/payments and accrued interest being covered has cost me accrued interest on my loan as of XX/XX/XXXX of {$1000.00} and it is increasing every day that I am not in SAVE. According to Mohela 's website I am still in XXXX as Mohela has not yet placed me in the SAVE plan. My requests to Mohela have been met with emails saying there is a """" correspondace processing delay. '' My payment is {$270.00} due at the end of XXXX and Supervisor XXXX told me she doesn't think Mohela will be able to process my SAVE application and have me in the right plan until maybe the beginning of XXXX further costing me more money. She indicated the multiple applications and the XXXX application are likely delaying my original SAVE application. I am very frustrated. 

Supervisor XXXX said the agent who filled out the XXXX plan on the phone for me should not have done that but he may have been in """" training. '' I understand everyone goes through training, however this is a problem and I was misled by more than one Mohela agent. Also why when my consolidated loan """" go live '' on Mohela 's website did it show was I placed in an ICR plan? An XXXX plan generates more accrued interest for Mohela. To make matters worse, Mohela is generating interest off a total sum owed that includes $ XXXX pandemic pause payment that I requested to be reimbursed a year ago on XX/XX/XXXX and I have not yet seen despite getting an ombudsman and both of our multiple requests to Mohela ( I have a filed a separate CFPB complaint for the missing XXXX ). Mohela needs to reimburse accrued interest generated from this consolidated loan not being in SAVE as a result of being misled by their agents.

So not only is my account showing delinquent for 4 months, they have not applied my payments. When I asked in a chat when it would be fixed I was told due to backlogs this would be a few weeks. So after my next payment is due. 

I was told I should not use autopay. I was not even aware the payments were lost until I went to file my taxes  and wanted the tax statement. So who knows how long this would have remained this way had I not checked. 

They have to know and fix this in a more expeditious manner than saying it could take a couple of weeks is unacceptable when they have had my funds for up to 4 months.

I had submitted a XXXX  form to my prior loan servicer so when it transferred to Mohela, I reached out to them to make sure my XXXX transferred as well and they assured me it did and they were processing it. By XXXX of XXXX I hadn't heard anything further which was weird to me because I believed I all ready had qualified for forgiveness because I have been a public servant for over XXXX  years with the same employer ( XXXX ) and made over 120 qualifying payments. I decided to reach out to them again in XXXX of XXXX and they said there was a problem with my XXXX form and they needed wet signatures because the signatures on the form weren't legible. This was also weird seeing as how I had copies of the form and both signatures were clear and legible but I submitted a new form per their request and physically got the signatures from my employer. I faxed and emailed the new form in XXXX of XXXX and was informed they received it and would take time to process. I decided to be patient and take their word for it. By XXXX of XXXX, payments were to resume and I got a letter stating I would need to start making payments again. By this point I as confused because through the XXXX  program my loans should have been processed for forgiveness and its been years and they have not been. I reached out to the student federal loan website and filed a complaint with no resolve and was told to reach out to Mohela yet again. In XXXX of XXXX, I sat on the phone waiting to get through to someone for XXXX hours. Finally I got through to someone and they said my form wasn't processed because the signatures weren't legible. Floored, because I've now sent this form twice where the signatures were clear, I asked them what I should do next and they informed me to have my form electronically signed. So in the first week of XXXX of XXXX, I sent a third XXXX form, this time with electronic signatures. My employer got the email to sign it from the federal student loan website, signed it, and sent it back. She even sent me proof of doing this. The website still said they were waiting on my employers signature so I again called them and was put on hold for XXXX hours. When I got through, I spoke to a trainee who couldn't understand why my loans hadn't been processed for forgiveness and she said it was because I had duplicate forms which showed overlapping employment. WHAT!?!? I have worked for XXXX, the same agency since XXXX and it is now XXXX, and Mohela told me to submit new forms because of unclear signatures, now thats a problem? She explained that it was a computer issue and she would get me connected to an agent to fix this computer error. I was then placed on hold for another hour, and finally an agent got on the phone. She then informed me they only had record of the one form I sent in XXXX of XXXX. That is until I told her I had paper trails of the form sent in XXXX, again in XXXX, and again in XXXX and transcripts saved of conversations with MOHELA and the federal student aid website and would be more than happy to send them to her for proof. She then began backtracking and put me on another brief hold. When she got back on the phone she had miraculously found my original form from XXXX and didn't know why it was denied for signatures because according to her the signatures her clear and she could read them perfectly fine. She then corrected this error, and my payment count was brought to XXXX payments which shocker qualifies me for loan forgiveness through XXXX with my XXXX years of service to the public. My account was put in a default forbearance and now an administrative forbearance with interest still accruing. That is where is stops. The payment count on their website reads that I have made the required qualifying payments and my employment has been verified and my employer for the last XXXX years. I have had no further correspondence, can not get through to them, and they say my loans will start to need to be paid again beginnning in XXXX when my forebearance will end. How are they getting away with this? I HAVE MET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A PROGRAM THAT BEGAN IN XXXX. I HAVE MADE XXXX PAYMENTS OVER XXXX YEARS WORKING AS A PUBLIC SERVANT FOR THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

Maybe this complaint will be the one that is taken seriously, and something will be done.

XX/XX/XXXX I applied for PSLF through the FSA website. Quickly both my employers were confirmed. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from the Department of Education saying both my employers are eligible under the PSLF plan. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Mohela stating I had applied for PSLF but You are not eligible yet, as you have not yet made the required 120 qualifying payments necessary to be eligible for PSLF. I logged into the site and a PSLF tracker stated I had 41 payments towards PSLF and 143 toward TEPSLF. This information seemed incorrect as I have worked for qualifying employers and made payments for almost 13 years, and when I looked into the details of what Mohela noted as a qualifying payment, it was completely unclear. I have been making payments on the Extended Repayment plan for years. How only 41 of those did qualify and others didnt was not at all clear. Luckily though, in contrast to the email, the 143 TEPSLF payments wold qualify for forgivness. 

XX/XX/XXXX Mohela began transitioning my account to their new website and I could no longer access my account with an expected time frame of about 2 weeks. This email from Mohela clearly states, This change will not affect your loan 's existing terms, conditions, interest rates, available repayment plans, or progress toward loan forgiveness, if eligible. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called Mohela to ask about my PSLF progress and if I needed to make any changes towards forgiveness. The rep told me they could not access any of my information but did explain it sounds like I qualify and I should also get a refund for overpayments. The agent stated that the TEPSLF would transfer over and count toward forgiveness and I didnt need to do anything. I was told to wait and see. That call took about an hour and a half. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received an email that my account was ready on the new site. When I logged in and set up my account. I no longer had any information about PSLF, no PSLF tracker, no history of payments, and no history of interest paid. Parts of the website were not functional. My account was as if they simply moved my remaining loan amount and started all payments back to zero. 

XX/XX/XXXX I noticed the Federal Student Aid website also had incorrect information. I reached out to them via the website and explained the issues with both websites and the lack of information. Their advice was to call Mohela. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called the direct Mohela PSLF number. I talked to 3 different agents who were all in training. 2 of them said they could only see the same information I could see. One agent said I had more info than them. The 4th agent, also a trainee could access my info. Initially, they were argumentative and said Its not like I have a wrench and can crawl under the desk to fix the website '. I tried to then get info on my PSLF count. The agent said they did not know what a PSLF count was. I then explained that I needed to know how many payments were counted towards forgiveness. Finally, they did provide info based on terms, and said it looked like one loan was eligible for forgiveness and had overpayments and the other was 3 payments away. They said one loan had 185 terms and 115 terms for the other. I asked why there was a difference in terms since I had always paid toward both loans and technically they should be the same count. She could not answer that.

She asked someone for help and they responded that she should tell me, I could see all my info on the old website. I explained that I could not even log in to the old website. I continued to ask for help, or if she could forward me to someone to help, and she explained that when agents forward you up the chain, it isnt the case and they have no idea where calls go and most often it is the luck of the draw as to whether you can get a supervisor or someone who can help. She directly stated, I was not going to get any answers. After repeated holds and deflections she finally said I needed to call back next week at XXXX XXXX  and leave a message and that was my best option. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Mohela stating my repayment schedule changed. I noticed my monthly payment went from {$270.00} per month to XXXX. There was no indication of why, what that payment was going for, and how it affected my PSLF. 

XX/XX/XXXX I logged into the Mohela website and the site now was a jumbled amount of information without any structure. It seemed as if the XXXX XXXX for the site was missing and while it had the same content many of the links and menus were broken. I tried several browsers and all of them displayed the broken website. 

I had also been reaching out to Federal Student Aid and I received an email response from them simply stating I needed to contact Mohela. 

XX/XX/XXXX I again reached out to Federal Student Aid for help via their chat. I was still concerned that the FSA info on my loan displayed no detailed information or history and Repayment Status reflected only 1 payment even though I have paid over half of both loans. The FSA agent suggested contacting Mohela. I asked who determines my Repayment History as it is incorrect on both sites. The agent said Mohela controls that. I also explained that Mohela refused to give me information, does not respond to email requests and phone calls require hours long time with no results. The agent suggested I submit a feedback case. They then referred me back to studentaid.gov if I needed more information- which completely ignored the point of the chat. The info on studentaid.gov is also incorrect. 

XX/XX/XXXX Called in again to Mohela, and the Advanced Customer Service Representative confirmed I qualified for forgiveness and had made more than the 120 payments. They clarified that it for the TEPSLF it was only important that I have an eligible employer ( which should also amount to about 151 payments ). They said the process for forgiveness had already started and was in the hands of the FSA to review qualifying payments. They also claimed that the FSA would determine how many payments would be applied toward a refund or overpayment. They said that the process should take a month, yet when I explained that the process began in early XXXX, they seemed concerned it had not progressed at all. 
The CSR then explained that when they created the new website it was not compatible with the PSLF information and they just learned about this in a meeting that morning. They said the plan was to move any borrowers who were applying toward PSLF back to the old website and it should only take about 15 days for this to take place. The agent also recommended I apply for forbearance so I didnt have to worry about overpaying on a loan that should be forgiven. I applied for a 6 month forbearance that evening and was approved. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received a response to one of the many inquiries I had made through the Federal Student Aid website. The email had the same generic response suggested I contact Mohela but did note, You are currently on the Extended Fixed payment plan that doesn't qualify for the PSLF forgiveness. You will need to change your payment plan to be eligible for PSLF, and to have your past payments counted. This should be done before XX/XX/XXXX. 
This was in direct contradiction to most all of the conversations I had with Mohela in the past several weeks and clearly was in response to that they did not have access to my loan history, so on the FSA side they only note 1 payment done in XXXX of this year towards my loans. 

XX/XX/XXXX As a result of the FSA email, I reached out again to Mohela. They again explained the issue with the website and that they expected it to be resolved in the 15 days since I last spoke to them. They said that we still had 2 more days and it would be resolved. In response the FSA email, Mohela said they did not see any recommendation for me to move to an Income-Driven Repayment Plan. The agent began talking about submitting a manual application but then directed me to apply for the IDR plan through the FSA website. I was concerned about applying for the IDR plan because I knew it would require a lot of recent financial information, some of which I didnt have access to. I was also concerned that it would draw out the process and cause more roadblocks to forgiveness. The agent assured me that that would not be the case and I should apply for the IDR while we waited for the website to be fixed. I again explained that the major issue here is Mohela has refused to give me detailed information about my account for close to 2 months which in doing has also slowed my forgiveness and caused a huge amount of XXXX. The agent forwarded me to a message asking for another representative to call me back. 

In the meantime, I again reached out to the Federal Student Aid help via Chat. Instantly the FSA agent suggested I apply for the IDR plan. I tried to explain to the agent the issue with Mohela and the website and how it affected my PSLF. She directed me to submit a complaint. The agent then said that Mohela was lying and that I needed to be on an eligible plan before my loans could be forgiven. The FSA agent then explained that the reason I had no information on my past loans and payments was that I was not on an eligible plan. Again they seemed to not be hearing that I already had 143 payments and more wanted me to change my payment plan so I would see any counts toward forgiveness. They then suggested submitting a complaint if Mohela wont provide my payment history. The agent also said if I had the payments I noted earlier, I would qualify for forgiveness. 

Later that evening another representative, XXXX from Mohela called me back. She again explained that the website can not service anyone applying for PSLF. I asked how that could have even happened and she did not offer any explanation instead continuing to restate that the old website or the old system had all my information and the new one did not. I was clear that as a borrower I had a right to access my account and account history and Mohela has denied me that right since XXXX. The agent then explained that there was no timeline to move my account to the old website and that they were really waiting to see if the company that made the new website could fix the problems and if they could not then they would transition any affected borrowers back to the old website and that process from the beginning would take 15 days. I should wait for an email that notes my account is transitioning back. I asked if there was any idea of the timeline I might expect to wait, weeks, months, or years? She explained she did not want to give me any dates for fear they might be incorrect. I explained that has been the case all along and just earlier today I was told this would be fixed in 2 days. I also was clear, that while most everyone I talk to has stated I qualify for forgiveness, I actually have no documentation and no payment history, I only have notes from phone calls and while the TEPSLF isnt likely to be a fund that runs out soon, it could and Mohela has a notorious history of delaying, stalling and providing misinformation to borrowers of which I have documented experience. One person states one thing, and another completely contradicts it, so whom should I trust? I asked for their advice on how I protect myself without any documentation? The agent stated that in XXXX when I received a denial letter that it should have noted my PSLF counts. I asked why then did I even get a denial letter than when she hereself has repeatedly confirmed I had more than the needed amount of payments. She stated the PSLF initial denial letter technically has to sent to borrowers due to a waiver. Again I noted that even with documentation, I had completely false information and how was I not to know that after months or years, Mohela couldnt refer back to that letter stating I was denied forgiveness as well as how it had prompted the FSA to also deny me PSLF based on missing information. The agent said she would mail a copy of that letter to me to note its PSLF counts and that it would arrive in about 6 days. I also asked that they email me my payment history, she attempted to avoid this several times, referring back to a script about the unknown timeline of fixing or changing the website. After some time the agent agreed to send me my payment history via US mail and that it would take up to 66 business days. I also asked if there was any documentation that could affirm what all had told me, which was that my loans were eligible for forgiveness, she stated that they could not do that until the loans were fully forgiven. I explained that plenty of people get letters or messages in their accounts noting that their loans were eligible for forgiveness. 

XX/XX/XXXX I reached out to FSA help via chat and asked about the status of my IDR application as well as the compaint I was gudied to submit. The agent confirmed my application was completed on XX/XX/XXXX but Mohela had not responded to the IDR application. I also asked for assitance with my account history to which the rep said they could see my payment histroy only back to XXXX and I should be able to see that on the FSA website. I followe dtheir directions and explained I could not. I asked if that rep could send me my payment history of which they said they could see, they suggested I download my data. Again i explained all my data and information on the FSA site was incomplete and erased my history. 
The agent did confirm that the issue I was experiencing was one many borrowers were experiencing 'across the board '. The agent abruptly shut down the chat at that point. 

XX/XX/XXXX FSA publicly announced they would transition all PSLF away from Mohela back to FSA. This will happen XX/XX/XXXX and in no way accounts for ongoing issues with Mohela, or forthcoming deadlines such as the XX/XX/XXXX deadline for IDR repayment. 

Mohela emailed that they will be again 'transitioning ' my account back to Mohela.com. This is to begin XX/XX/XXXX and take 14 days- which puts me right up again the transition back to FSA. If there are any issues with my account, I will have at most 2 days to attend to them via hours long phone calls and empty promises from Mohela. 

XX/XX/XXXX I sought out help from the FSA chat again. The agent referred me to Mohela to solve the delay in processing the IDR. I explained I had no luck with that. The agent also said my complaint needed 60 days for a response. I explained that if Mohela does not process my IDR by XX/XX/XXXX, I will lose out on 13 years of qualifying payments. I asked if there was anyone to escalate my case to and the response was none. They suggested I contact the Department of Education or an Ombudsman. There is no option to connect my complaint to an Ombudsman on the FSA site. I have to wait for a response to my complaint in 60 days to even have the option to escalate to an Ombudsman. I also explained that with the FSA transition it will completely hinder and offer no resolution to the many borrowers who are having issues with Mohela such as me. The agent responded the FSA has no means of expediting my case. I continued to explain I was not looking for an expediting but advanced support. The agent shut down the chat.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","RI","02905","","Consent provided","Web",2024-04-06,"Closed with non-monetary relief","Yes","N/A",8704744,2024

This settlement distinctly offers relief to """" non-traditional '' borrowers, identified by having a XXXX score below XXXX at loan origination. My apprehension is rooted in Navient 's claim of being unable to retrieve my credit score from the relevant period, citing data retention policies. This assertion not only casts doubt on the settlement 's efficacy but also on Navient 's commitment to fulfilling its obligations with integrity. 

The essence of my concern lies in the possibility that Navient may have agreed to the settlement without the genuine intent or capability to validate and acknowledge claims from borrowers like myself, who are presumptively eligible for relief. Such a scenario would not only undermine the settlement 's foundational goals but could also represent a substantial breach of trust and agreement. 

The gravity of this issue extends beyond my individual case, potentially affecting numerous others in similar predicaments. Hence, I seek your intervention to ensure Navient adheres to the settlement terms with diligence and honesty. If Navient is indeed unable to provide credit scores from the discussed period, it becomes imperative to question the validity of loans issued under these conditions, suggesting a negotiation in bad faith. 

Furthermore, it is pertinent to highlight the coercive pressure to add my father as a co-signer based on his similar credit standing, a move that was crucial for loan qualification. This detail underscores the broader implications of Navient 's practices on borrowers and their families. 

I urge your immediate attention to this matter, advocating for a resolution that upholds the principles of fairness and accountability. Your action is not only crucial for individual cases like mine but also for the integrity of the settlement at large.

Any other repayment allocation method than applying the entire payment to the highest interest loan is predatory and should not be allowed by the Department of Education or any other agency with jurisdiction over Federal Student Loans. My account is now listed as past due and I can only make payments if I agree to allow them to allocate them in the predatory fashion that keeps me in debt longer and makes them more profit in interest payments.","","Nelnet, Inc.","NV","891XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-08,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8127191,2024

While using the options """" Special Payment Instructions '', I selected """" Apply Excess by Percentages '' and then distribute the percentages to pay in full loans AH, AC, and AD. 

As soon as I submitted this request the system didn't allow me to move forward due to the following problem : """" Sorry, there's been a problem. 
The has been logged and reported to our technical team. 

What you can do first : - Refreshed the browser and try again - Log out your account and log back in again. '' I did follow the recommendation twice and couldn't move forward. 
I decided to go ahead and made a bulk payment and later contacted customer support. I explained the same, I am writing to you on this request. The rep took notes, make the calculations, and documented the way the payment should be allocated. 

I can see my request has not been considered. 

I need you to please correct this and ensure that the following loans are paid in full of my last payment : Loans : AC, AH, and AD. These are the loans with the higher percentage rate I want also to bring to your attention another issue I had last year when the payment resume took place. The platform took me the money twice from my bank account. I called to request a correction and unfortunately for me the rep was extremely unpolite letting me talking alone. She decided not to say a think even though she was on the line. 

At this point, this is clear for me that Nelnet care less about us the loaners. Who can help?

I recertified my employment based on the information they provided in the XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  letter, and they recalculated my payment. The letter they sent me dated XX/XX/XXXX, states at the bottom that I was not required to recertify my income for my XXXX  if it fell within 6 months of the payment restart date, which occurred on XX/XX/XXXX, so any recertification required on or before XX/XX/XXXX, would be pushed out a year. MOHELA failed to include that last part in the XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  letter. Thus, I feel MOHELA forced me to recertify my income for my XXXX when it was not required, and the result is my payment is now {$390.00} instead of {$310.00}, which is a difference of {$940.00} a year.

2024-02-07,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","In XXXX I filed a complaint with the dept. of education regarding this issue. 

I made the minimum payment on my subsidized and unsubsidized loans then specified an over payment for the loan with the smaller balance. It automatically changed my overpayment amount to be reapplied to other loan, essentially making it IMPOSSIBLE to pay off that loan early. After DOE got involved, Aidvantage corrected it, I was allowed to specify overpayment amounts correctly for the month of XXXX. 

it has now reverted back to where I can not specify an overpayment amount. I just want to pay my loans off as quickly as possible. Aidvantage does not get to tell me where I'm allocating my debt payments ; what is the poXXXX of allowing me to """" specify '' if I can't actually specify an overpayment??? 

I tried calling to make the payment over the phone using the number that is listed on their website. However, their call center just circles you back around every single time. After 5 minutes I finally hit the """" question/return call '' option and got thru to an employee named XXXX. 

She told me that I can't pay more on one loan than the other because even thou it is consolidated, and sub and unsub are separate, its actually only one loan. So I asked why it gives me the option to specify and she said that's for unconsolidated loans. When I told her about how it is possible to do that I paid that way in XXXX she put me on a 10min hold then said I can make the overpayment online and let it allocate itself, then call XXXX ( not listed on their website ) to speak to a representative to have them reallocate the funds correctly. I asked her how can I do that if I cant even get thru their call center to speak with someone to make a payment in the first place. She then said she can't do anything their call center must be having issues but that I can leave a voicemail and they'll call me back. I left a voicemail hours ago and have yet to receive a call back. considering no one is answering calls on that line, i highly doubt they will return my call. 

I can not find any statutes or laws that are backing up what Aidvantage is telling me about the overpayment/automatic reallocation despite specifying for each loan amount to be paid. 

Mind you, this is all over an OVERPAYMENT ( ie interfering with the amount of interest that could potentially be made on the balance is only minimum payments are made ). The minimum payments are still being made. 

Even if I had XXXX in the bank I couldn't even pay that loan off if I wanted to because : 1. the website will automatically change my payment to be applied to a totally separate loan ( despite XXXX telling me its one loan, it is listed as two loans on my portal ) ; and 2. I can't get thru to anyone in their payment center to make a payment correctly, per their policy for overpayment specification. 

There is an option to mail payments in the form of a check but I am afraid to do so because i'm concerned it would get """" lost '' and not applied to my account at all forcing me to incur additional fees and penalties. 

I just want to be able to pay off my loan. I should not be forced to accrue daily compounding interest on a loan I am actively trying to make overpayments on. This is incredibly predatory of Aidvantage, and by forcing payments this way and refusing to answer phone calls they are ensuring that my loan repayment is drug out as long as possible and that I incur as much interest as possible. 

This is my 3rd complaint regarding this matter. Each time they """" fix it '' for a few months then revert back to their predatory practices. This is not fair I'm literally getting punished for doing what I'm supposed to be doing and for trying to pay back a loan as quickly as possible.","","Maximus Education, LLC dba Aidvantage","MS","39047","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-07,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8301365,2024

2024-03-08,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","MOHELA has been mishandling my loans, giving me misinformation, changing the information I am given, and mismanaging my payments. I was notified on XX/XX/XXXX that my loans were placed on administrative forbearance from XXXX of XXXX and was told I could request a refund of the payments that I made during that time period. I called MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX and requested the refund, and was told after processing, it would take 30-60 days to receive my refund of {$510.00}. It has been 42 business days and I have not received my refund. I have been notified in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX that I have missed loan payments and my account is past due, even though I have set up auto debit and they have taken my payments on time each month. When I called about this issue on XX/XX/XXXX, I was on the phone for a total of 2 hours and 53 minutes. In that phone call I was told that receiving my refund now could take up to 90 days, and there is no way to track the status. When explaining to them the issue of my account being past due I was repeatedly told that was not true although my account was marked that way and was reading as owing double what my monthly payment is. The first representative I spoke to told me it had to do with an error in my refund process and transferred me to another department. The wait time for that transfer was 104 minutes long. I requested a call back. The next phone call I had, the representative could not tell me the reason for my account being past due as she could see that I have made my payments on time. Her solution was to turn off my auto debit so that I could manually pay my monthly payment amount, and told me the past due amount would be taken care of. I told her that I did not want my auto debit turned off, but she did it anyway. I manually initiated my monthly payment on XX/XX/XXXX, and as of XX/XX/XXXX my account continues to have a status of past due. The other issue I have had has been regarding my repayment plan. I was originally on an IDR plan, and applied to change to the SAVE plan through studentaid.gov. I completed all necessary forms, and uploaded all of the paperwork that it requested from me and was told it was sent to MOHELA for processing. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a message on my MOHELA account dated XX/XX/XXXX notifying me that there was a delay in my request. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a message in my MOHELA account dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that my request for SAVE could not be approved due to missing income information. I was not sent email correspondence notifying me of this message and only saw it when I logged on to my MOHELA account to check if my request was processed. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent a message to MOHELA through my portal requesting more information about the status of my application. I received a response notifying me that they received my income documentation on XX/XX/XXXX, and were processing my application, although in my account my request was marked as denied. I then called MOHELA to discuss what the issue with my application was and they told me that my income verification was too old. I explained that the documentation was timely when I submitted my application and was only outdated due to their slow processing time. I was told on the phone my the representative that she could apply for SAVE again for me through our phone call. I agreed to this and self-reported my income at that time. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a message through my account notifying me that there was another processing delay. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a message through my account notifying me that I was approved and my loans were changed to the SAVE plan, and I was given my new payment amount. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter in my MOHELA account that was dated XX/XX/XXXX notifying me that they received my request to switch to and IDR but could not process that request due to being unable to verify my income.

2024-02-09,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I am a student loan borrower pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness. My loan servicer for my federal student loans is MOHELA. 

With the return to payment after the COVID-19 student loan pause, the Department of Education issued clear guidance ( found here : https : //studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19 ) that no borrower would be required to recertify income prior to XX/XX/XXXX. Additionally, that for borrowers with a recertification date prior to XX/XX/XXXX, that date would be pushed back by XXXX year. 

My loans on StudentAid.gov have been updated to reflect this public guidance. On my account, I have an IDR anniversary date of XX/XX/XXXX for each of my loans. I have provided this information to MOHELA and attached it here. 

Despite nearly XXXX months of continuous customer service wrangling with MOHELA, I have been unable to get them to accept the continuation of my current IDR plan until its expiration on XX/XX/XXXX. They are currently set to improperly increase my payments to by over $ 2000 monthly beginning in XXXX. Today I spoke with a supervisor who informed me that none of my information was correct, that it did not matter what my anniversary date on StudentAid.gov was, and that MOHELA would not provide any flexibility to the requirement that I recertify immediately. I informed her that was an unacceptable response, and asked to speak to someone else, but was told there was nobody else who could provide me with other information. 

I informed the agent that I would under no circumstances recertify my income a year before it is actually required, and that I plan to continue to make the same monthly payment as approved by my IDR plan in XXXX, no matter what MOHELA 's calculation of my bill payment is. 

The abuse of student loan borrowers- and particularly borrowers who have specifically pursued public service under the prospect of PSLF- by MOHELA has been widespread and unacceptable. This is yet another instance of MOHELA inflicting clear harm on borrowers despite clear federal guidance to the contrary- and in my case in fact clear personal information that my IDR plan expiration date is different from the date MOHELA has for me.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","PA","171XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-09,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8315675,2024

2024-03-09,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","During the COVID-19 lockdown, my student loans were transferred from Great Lakes to Nelnet. My first payment was due in XX/XX/XXXX, which I made on time. I then paid the following months bill, which was for the same amount of {$29.00} ( this is actually the amount shown on my Income Driven Repayment Annual Notice issued by Nelnet themselves ). As XXXX rolled around, I received a statement that said no further payments were due until XX/XX/XXXX ( this clearly was not correct, as I never overpaid or paid more than the minimum due ). 
I called Nelnet for what would be the first of many times, and they couldnt really give me a straight answer ; they just recommended paying the amount on my IDR Annual Notice even if my statements were inaccurate ( the first red flag ). I did just that, and now Im seeing a different payment amount for XXXX ( {$25.00}, which makes no sense given that my payments are supposed to be {$29.00} monthly ). AND apparently I owe nothing for XXXX somehow even though I havent paid XXXX yet. My payment amounts and due dates are NEVER consistent when I should be paying {$29.00} per month. To add to my confusion, I called Nelnet back where yet another unqualified customer support agent told me that my monthly amount due would change to around {$90.00} in the coming months. HOW? I received zero notice and their own IDR Annual Notice clearly states that my amount due is {$29.00} EVERY MONTH. In fact, what she says makes zero sense given my current income level and my repayment plan ; anybody can figure out their rough payment amount online, and mine certainly shouldnt be close to {$90.00}. 
I have a right to know what I owe, when I owe it, and why I owe it. Nelnet cant explain any of that to me. In an attempt to fix my account, theyve placed some of my loans under administrative forbearance and now my interest has BALLOONED over {$120.00} in just mere days ( there shouldnt be any interest accrual during Forbearance, let alone way more than my actual rate ). I have wasted hours and hours of my life trying to get some straight answers from this abysmal company and I cant bear to call them again because they have NO IDEA what they are doing over there. I NEVER had to call Great Lakes because they understood that paying a monthly bill shouldnt be a hassle. 

This company is ruining peoples lives. A quick search of recent complaints will tell you that NELNET NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED AND SHUT DOWN UNTIL EVERYTHING IS FIXED.","","Nelnet, Inc.","OK","741XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-09,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8511735,2024

I applied for Income Driven Repayment plans, was not updated on its status, and called numerous times for updates. On each call, usually hours long, the associate would tell me not to worry, and that I would receive an approval soon. This began in XX/XX/XXXX. 

By XX/XX/XXXX, I still had not received that information, and they notified me that a payment was coming due. I called again, and this time spent nearly 3 hours talking to an associate. It turns out Nelnet had never processed the application. I worked with her to get it approved right there and then, and to apply the forbearance to the previous months. She said it was completed, and sent me official documents stating I had {$0.00} payments through XX/XX/XXXX. 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email stating there were now over {$2000.00} in payments due, including a {$1800.00} charge that was 131 days past due. 

If I wasnt tenacious and frustrated to the point of fury, I could see how Nelnet would prey on someone who might just pay the charge and get further into financial ruin. 

This is completely unacceptable, and it is in line with a long string of predatory behavior. Nelnet recently lost a class action lawsuit around the same matter in Massachusetts.

My most recent talk with a customer service representative had the representative tell me my XXXX application was denied and that I was in the XXXX program as well.

I feel like I am talking to people who have no idea what they're talking about. They are just making up answers and wasting my time. Meanwhile, my interest is accruing when it shouldn't be.

I have received a XXXX  % discount for paying via auto-pay and a XXXX  % discount for on-time payments for years. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I updated my auto-pay banking information because I changed to a new bank. I have never received any notice that my auto-payments would be disrupted in any way due to the change in my banking information. 

My student loan auto-payment was not drafted in XX/XX/XXXX. I did not receive any notification that my account was not paid or past due. In XX/XX/XXXX, I checked my account and noticed it was past due which surprised me because my account has been on auto-pay for years. I paid the past due amount and inquired what happened. At this time, I also noticed that my discounts had been disqualified. 

The XXXX % discount for auto-pay was reinstated but my XXXX  % discount was not due to the missed XX/XX/XXXX payment. The payment was missed because Nelnet did not draft the payment via my auto-pay, not because I neglected to pay my balance. I called Nelnet customer service on XX/XX/XXXX to issue a complaint to get the XXXX  % reinstated given that my account is on auto-pay. I was told during this call that my issue would be escalated to management and a manager would call me back. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Nelnet customer service to follow up on the matter given that I had not received a call from management. During the XX/XX/XXXX call, the representative said that the customer service representative that I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX gave me the wrong information. The new representative said that an incentive request form would need to be filed on my behalf and that I would receive a decision in XXXX business days. I called in XX/XX/XXXX and was told by a representative that an incentive form could not be found related to my matter. I was on the phone for over an hour with no resolve. It's been several weeks and I haven't been provided any decision nor do I have any confirmation that an incentive form has been filed to remedy the issue. I am put on hold for hours when I call Nelnet with no resolution. I believe they are giving me the run around so they can deny my incentive to force me to pay them more in interest and fees for profit.","","Nelnet, Inc.","GA","30318","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-24,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8212584,2024

2024-03-08,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Problem with customer service","Ever since Mohela took over my loan it has been a comedy of errors. To add insult to injury just as payments returned after Covid funding ended, they decided to change their system. I started receiving notices that my account was in arrears via email. I called them and spend multiple hours on hold for them just to hang up on me. 

I finally was able to get someone on the phone, and setup my """" new account '' along with setting up an autopay function with my checking account, and made a single payment. Wouldn't you know it, the auto pays are not happening, and I can not get into my new account. I can enter the old account, but not see payments since it tells me that I am in the process of being transferred to their new system. I already did this!!!!!!! 

When I attempt to create a """" new account '' it says that I am not in the system. If I try to use forgot password, it says that I do not have an account. I tried all email addresses that I have, and get the same thing. It is and remains a Sisyphean XXXX in dealing with bureaucracy. 

I have once again tried to get someone on the phone to fix the issue, and spent multiple hours on hold after going through the labyrinth that is their phone system. The last time I was on hold for over 4 hours in my place of employment in the background. I heard someone pick up the phone after the 4 hours, and I could clearly hear a conversation and laughing in the background. They promptly hung up the call after a few seconds. I spent another subsequent hour on hold after that, and I had to return to my job. 

At this point I am considering suing Mohela for damage to my credit report due to their lack of professionalism, and inability to even deal with simplest of requests by consumers of their product.

I was charged excessive fees beginning with initial loan disbursement fees and have since incurred late fees, adjustments, and unjust capitalized interest. I was unable to pay the full amount of all of my loan payments upon graduation as I was unable to obtain a suitable job or livable wages for a XXXX XXXX  after graduating amid the recession of XXXX. I was harassed nonstop by collectors for these loans who even threatened to garnish my wages when I was making minimum wage and barely able to afford rent. The only option I was given at the time was forbearance and interest capitalization. Once I finally had some work experience and was able to obtain a """" real '' job in XXXX I was able to begin making payments and have continued to do so despite financial struggles, medical debts and the steep cost of living in XXXX. Although I have consistently made payments my loan repayment period had to be extended due to the loan amounts snowballing over the capitalized interest and fees. The original amount of my loans is {$70000.00} and to date I have paid about {$50000.00} leaving the initial remaining loan amount to be about {$20000.00}. Instead, because of interest and fees, my overall balance is still over my original loan amount and I owe {$79000.00} and I will be in repayment until XXXX. How is it that individuals from low-income households are forced to pay double or triple the amount for a college education due to unfair interest capitalization processes?

I spoke with a loan service rep supervisor on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, and requested a refund for the payments i'd made on my loan since XXXX. At that time she said she'd submitted the request and i should receive the refund within 150 days ( per subsequent email and phone conversations, this was verified ). I did receive a refund for the payments made in XXXX, XXXX, & XXXX, after my loan was sold from XXXX to the next loan servicer, but i never received a XXXX for the payments made from XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX, and when I called to inquire today, was told i won't receive a refund for these payments. It is my understanding that if i had not made any payments at all between XX/XX/XXXX and the time when my loan was forgiven thru the PSLF program, all those months would still have counted toward my total 120mos of service & payment, and that amount, too, would have been forgiven. If needed, i can provide evidence of the payments made between XXXX thru XXXX ( printed from the XXXX website ), as well as the letter from XXXX dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX notifying me that my loans have been forgiven.

2024-01-31,"Student loan","Private student loan","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested a full amortization schedule detailing how my payments were being applied, a second full audit of my account due to being charged for 31 days instead of 30 days according to the 30 days in that statement period, one question asking why my previous and new balances were not reported correctly on my recent statements, and a second question asking about the numerous reversals of interest accruals. I was given an inaccurate amortization schedule ( my mom informed me as she works for a financial institution ), a system-notated transaction history, and a letter telling me what I had received and who to call if I have any questions, which was not necessary ). My lawyer requests all communication be in written format and fully detailed. 

First, I am frustrated because the amortization schedule sent to me shows my payments are to be applied to interest and principal. However, they are applying my full payment ( minimum plus extra ) to interest. For example, I was charged {$1400.00} in interest from XXXX XXXX XXXX and my minimum payment is {$1700.00}. For this statement period I paid {$1800.00}, so why is all of it going to interest. What makes this worse is being given a schedule that shows a portion of my payment goes to principle after being applied to interest. My agreement says, """" All payments will be credited first to any other charges other than principal and FINANCE CHARGES, then to FINANCE CHARGES, and finally to the outstanding principal balance of my account ''. Seems self explanatory, however, my lender seems to take this as paying my unpaid interest until zeroed, then my next set of payments will only be applied to capitalized interest, and finally my next set of payments will only be applied to the principal balance ( as per my co-borrowers phone call in XX/XX/XXXX ). Not sure I see how this loan can be paid off in XXXX years or whatever they claim my term to be as according to UAS I gave up a year due to asking for an in-school deferment, which is a whole other issue I have with them. All my other student loan lenders apply my payments to interest and what is left goes to principal. If my interest is around {$1400.00} and you are asking me to pay close to {$1800.00}, where is the estimated remaining {$400.00} going. 

Second, none of my questions were answered from my XXXX request. I have no idea why the system reversed the accrued interest for various days. The only thing provided, Im assuming in regard to this topic, was a system-notated transaction history XXXX document, which had no written explanation. 

Third, the only information I have on the reported balances in my statements is from a phone call my co-borrower made in which they told her the balances on the statement are not important. However, my mom tells me by law they have to be reported and must be accurate. As a result, I have had to complete my own audit and calculations so I can make sure my payments are not being pocketed and my balances are correct Im not sure UAS isnt pocketing my payments or that my balances are correct. 

I also would like to know how the interest was capitalized in XX/XX/XXXX. UAS says {$36000.00} was capitalized, but the total interest charged before XX/XX/XXXX was {$40000.00}. So, what dates were used for the interest capitalization? How did UAS get {$36000.00}? 

I have determined the people at UAS must not have finance degrees and must not know anything about amortization schedules and how payments are to be applied. I hate to think about what else in my agreement has been violated other than applying payments incorrectly and giving me a forbearance that was not applicable to my situation of being in school according to my agreement. If you can not answer my questions or complete my requests, you should tell me so I can find someone who can.","","TRANSWORLD SYSTEMS INC","VA","20148","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-31,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8250906,2024

XXXX is another one, but I've sent a complaint about them. 

The loans in question came from the Fresh Start Initiative. It was not their loans. The Dept of Education pulled the loans out of default and reported them current and is no longer reporting the loans to credit agencies. They were sent to a non-default loan servicer, in this case AidVantage. They have taken it upon themselves to report the previous defaulted history, and are making a very serious mistake by also reporting them as CURRENTLY DELINQUENT. A mistake that should have been fixed already. They can not possibly be currently delinquent. 

I am a XXXX XXXX so this delinquency is not possible. I checked with my school regarding my enrollment certificate and it is correct. I contacted AidVantage about this and the response I received is very confusing. 

They are claiming that the loans were one time in default and that the deragotary mark would remain on my credit report for 7 years. 

One, I did not even claim that was the problem I had. Of course, they were at one time in default, thus the Fresh Start Initiative. My problem is that they are reporting the loans as CURRENTLY DELINQUENT. The last report they made to the credit agencies was that it was 120 days late back in 2019 and have not made any reports since. They also claim that the dept of Education has directed them to not make reports to the crediting agencies. 

The whole point of the Fresh Start initiative was to give consumers a new start. 

It makes no sense that the current payment status of my loans would say 120 days late. Especially since I have a deferment. It makes no sense that I should have to go through writing a letter, dispute it, etc. when it has already resulted in me being denied a private student loan. They erred when they reported the previous information about these loans and never updated them to reflect it's correct current status.

The woman I spoke to said that I was only placed on administrative forbearance because MOHELA messed up billing so everyone was placed into administrative forbearance. While I've seen posts online, taken with a grain of salt, about this happening, I was never told that this happened to my account nor was I told about that when I was issued a bill in XXXX XXXX. She said the only way that I could be placed into administrative forbearance now ( XXXX XXXX ) was to provide tax information to be placed into a forbearance repayment plan and that I don't qualify for administrative forbearance because I haven't hit XXXX payments yet. She also told me that the last representative didn't properly submit my request for review on my XXXX XXXX employer recertification form so they haven't even looked at that yet. I asked to speak with a supervisor and after waiting on hold for 45 additional minutes, I was transferred to an automated line that said a supervisor will call me back by the end of the next business day. 

So what I took away was that if you believe you hit XXXX and submit an employer recertification ( which you have to do annually, or at every new payment since you're only certified through the date you submit the form ) you have to continue to pay until MOHELA processes the paperwork and updates your account. If you take me as an example, I would have to make 3 to 4 months of extra payments while I wait for MOHLA to work through its incompetence and process my form. So not only do I have to make additional payments but I then get to fight with them for additional months to seek a reimbursement for payments over XXXX payments, and eventually get that money back without any interest or penalty on MOHELA 's side for their lengthy processing times? That's ridiculous. 

Not directly relevant to this issue, but last year when I recertified my employer history, other forms were marked as duplicates. They all were properly dated and had different employers and lengths of employment- when I called the representative asked whether two similar sounding employers were the same. I stated they were not and referenced the different tax IDs, addresses, and signatures. The form was processed correctly within 3 days. 

Regarding my options for my XXXX XXXX bill, I see my options as 1. Not paying my XXXX bill and hoping that MOHELA processes the recertification form and updates my count to XXXX before it goes to collections OR 2. Pay the bill and then fight with them for reimbursement after the XXXX count is updated. My XXXX payment wouldn't be qualifying unless I submit another employer recert form which, based on this experience, will take another 4 months to process. Either way I am out additional money and time for a problem that was not created by me. 

I see in the 34 CFR 685.205 subd. ( b ) ( 9 ), and other nearby provisions, that there seems to be authority for forbearance while there's administrative processing time. I would like to request any help your office may be able to provide. Or, at least help with voicing frustrations with MOHELA 's incompetence that is affecting my finances, my credit, and my emotional well-being. I appreciate your time and attention with this matter.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","CA","95762","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-18,"Closed with non-monetary relief","Yes","N/A",8177809,2024

2024-01-18,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","My loan servicers have switched over three times since creation of loan. From the beginning with XXXX XXXX, I was never properly informed of the set rules for PSLF. The rules continue to change, and we loan borrowers are never told the correct information from the customer service line. 

My loan was switched from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXXXXXX where I was again, misinformed about what plan my loans should be under for PSLF forgiveness. I was never told a concrete time for when to submit forms from my employer to verify my work status nor told how payments counted towards PSLF. 

My loan switched for a third time to Mohela, which now has a lawsuit against them. They have already been fined by the federal government and are still lacking in support of student borrowers. I have tried numerous times to get a representative on the phone and the two times I was able to get through, it took half days of waiting while I had to work, and the customer service reps did not know correct information and I was given random info that did not match previous conversations with customer support from other carriers. 

On XX/XX/24 I went to login on Mohela 's website to see yet another change from the carrier, this time a message about another platform. They are stating that moving to a new platform to expect, yes again, more delays. 

As of today, XX/XX/24, I have attempted to call both Mohela and PSLF service lines. Mohela gives an automated response that their lines are busy, and the call disconnects and PSLF service line ( XXXX ) says they are too busy and disconnects. Neither line gives an option to give student borrower a call back. 

I have submitted my last verification of employment form for PSLF from my employer. Mohela nor PSLF are not picking up the phone for me to confirm the receipt on their side. They are then requesting another 90 days just to process the information. I am stuck in limbo with making payments as from my calculations if they would go ahead and process my last PSLF report, I would have hit the 120 payments mark. I see that they have taken years to get around to others employment verification forms and many people have overpaid and are still waiting for refunds years later. I do not want to fall into the overpayment group as Mohela appears to not be reimbursing borrowers fairly and are instead getting richer while sending out inaccurate payment information. 


Mohela had over a year to plan for bringing back student loans and have failed and caused us student borrowers more harm. I am now at a loss of what payment plan I should be under as things change on their website month to month. I do not trust that they are accurately keeping track of payments, nor do I trust their determination of what plan borrowers should go under. I was recommended the SAVE plan, however most people that transferred to this plan are required to pay 3x their original loan payment amount. 

If my employer is able to complete an employment verification form within less than two days time, I ask for Mohela to be held to the same standards of turnaround time. It should not take 3 months to give notification of receipt of employment verification and payment verification. 

Student borrowers are being taken advantage of as with every move to a new carrier, new rules are being implemented on the fly, and borrowers are not given the chance to question why. We keep being pressured to pay into corrupt carriers that can't even track our payments. 

Again, there is already a lawsuit out against Mohela. Is the CFPB looking into them. If not, you should.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","NC","28213","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-18,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8170353,2024

On XX/XX/year> I submitted an IDR app for the SAVE plan. Between XXXX I submitted PSLF apps XXXX All indicated they were processing. Also, at that time by account showed, correctly, my 11 student loans and their balances. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter in the mail that my IDR app was denied due to not receiving documentation with the application. It directed me to submit the documentation online. First of all, when I submitted the IDR app, my income tax was pulled from the government tax file and attached to the application -- as proof of my income. 

Second of all, when I went to go online to submit it, all of my account information is gone. No balances, no loans. Just the """" smiley face '' that says """" Your account is in good standing. '' And now all the documents submitted and referenced above ( except the denial ) are labeled as """" Non-Mohela Brwr. '' When I log into Fed.

I understand that there is a time component to processing applications and documents. 
I understand there is a mass number of borrowers needing things processed right now. But is is difficult to even locate what that expected time frame might be. If they are experiencing such backlogs, why aren't they providing clearer information to let us know what is going on! 

I CAN NOT understand why there is no mechanism in place to let me know where it is in the process -- what is going on with my accounts. 

Why am I not receiving any communications? 

Based on what Fed. Student Aid and Mohela show when I am logged into my accounts on those pages, I have a {$0.00} balance. Why wouldn't I now assume that everything has been forgiven and I should alert the credit bureaus to remove the student loans from my account? 

Why did I not even get an auto-acknowledgement from Mohela when XXXX reached out for help and account information when logged into my account on their page? 

I tried calling Mohela, but hung up after two hours on hold without speaking to one person. And then, I only hung up because my phone battery died. How is that okay? 

All of this -- instead of helping me -- is holding me captive to Mohela and my student loans and keeping me from moving to other things in my life.

This appears to be an intentional delay in processing auto-pay request, something which could be automated.

I hold a job where I am able to pay my loans on the standard repayment plan within the standard 10 year time frame. I have not been able to successfully achieve a simple repayment plan with my servicer Nelnet yet. 

I have 18 separate loans with Nelnet of varying amounts. I initially had repayment dates throughout the month, which meant there was going to be a constant flow of seemingly random amounts of money being pulled out of my bank account. This has made budgeting a nightmare. It took multiple phone calls waiting on hold for upwards of 2 hours to get into contact with Nelnet to get my payment dates changed to the same day. I was told this would take place within a week. 

Weeks later, nothing had changed. I noted that my current payment for my XXXX XXXX loan was {$10.00}. I called again and was told it will take weeks for everything to switch over and that soon my regularly scheduled nearly {$1000.00} payment would be pulled. Meanwhile, I am accruing hundreds of dollars in interest. 

I began making manual payments of {$1000.00} to remain on schedule with my loans. 

I have most recently checked and my payment is now {$300.00}, and my loans are in forbearance. I have accrued almost {$1000.00} in unintended interest. My loans are going up not down, despite me trying to pay them. 

All I would like to do is pay my loans in a regular fashion 1x/month. Nelnet has been unable to manage this simple plan and set up.

I have called and they will not update their statements to show the accrued interest or fees associated with my student loans.

2024-02-10,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Improper use of your report","Reporting company used your report improperly","XXXX The presence of student loans on my credit report violates the Family Educational Act of 1974 and the Privacy Act of 1974. As per the aforementioned acts, educational institutions are obligated to safeguard student information and provide an opportunity to opt out before reporting such information to credit agencies. The school assured me they would not disclose my personal information, including financial details, to third-party credit agencies. This assurance was in accordance with the Family Educational Act of 1974, which establishes the privacy rights of students and protects their educational records. Furthermore, the Privacy Act of 1974 enforces limitations on the disclosure of personal information by federal agencies. Under this act, educational institutions are required to provide students with the opportunity to opt out of releasing their information to credit reporting agencies, allowing them to maintain control over their personal data. I am confident that my school was bound by these provisions. However, I recently discovered that student loans associated with my enrollment have been reported to credit agencies. Additionally, under the Higher Education Act, Federal student loans which have been reported to be in default for 7 years or more, must be deleted from a consumers credit record. As the law 15 U.S. Code 6801 - Protection of nonpublic personal information states that It is the policy of the Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers ' nonpublic personal information. My student loans are not public information and therefore should not be disclosed to third party companies. Furthermore, you do not have the right to report any data and/or information regarding my student loans to the three major Credit Agencies ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX ) or any other consumer financial institution because under law 15 U.S. Code 6801 I am protected against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to me, the customer. You are reporting to a nonaffiliated third party, as a creditor, when I have no contractual obligation between Aidvantage and myself, theres no signed contract between Aid Vantage and myself. In addition, law15 U.S. Code 6802 - Obligations with respect to disclosures of personal information states a financial institution may not, directly or through any affiliate, disclose to a nonaffiliated third party any nonpublic personal information, unless such financial institution provides or has provided to the consumer a notice that complies with section 6803 of this title. I have never given permission for my nonpublic information to be released to any third-party financial institution and I was never given a disclosure that such information would be disclosed to such third parties as its XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. Furthermore, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley ( GLB ) Act requires financial institutions to ensure the security How is any of my information being kept private and safe when it is being disclosed to these third parties, without my permission or consent, and on top of this, these major three credit bureaus keep having data breaches that expose my confidential information. - Law 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies. A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. The information being shared is inaccurate as my student loan balance is incorrectly calculated. -I demand to have the laws mentioned above that protect me as a consumer to be followed and respected. I do not want any of my information to be shared with any financial institution without my written consent and acknowledgement. I OPT OUT. 

Per FCRA as a Federally protected Consumer, I am now opting out of any and all authorization I the consumer may have given.

2024-01-27,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I am a full-time, XXXX XXXX at the University of Minnesota -- XXXX XXXX . My loan servicer ( Aidvantage ) can not seem to place my XXXX loans in in-school deferment. Even though I was told by the US Department of Education, the University of Minnesota, and my loan servicer that this notification would occur automatically through a national clearing house, it has not. I first submitted documentation of my student status to Aidvantage on or around XX/XX/XXXX ( the University of Minnesota had faxed separate documentation around two weeks prior to this ). Nothing was updated and the website said I owed a full payment of {$890.00} that month. I then applied for a income-driven repayment plan, thinking I could at least lower that amount while I waited for the in-school deferment to be put in place. Alas, the income-driven repayment plan application was also not swiftly processed. I ended up having to make a full payment of {$890.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, to prevent a past-due notice from occurring. I then spoke to an Aidvantage associate around this time, who placed my account in an administrative forbearance while the issue was fixed. The remainder of quarter four passed by with no problem. 

Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my income-driven repayment plan application had been approved. This somehow must have removed me from the administrative forbearance, because the notice stated that I now owed {$250.00} ... due two days later on XX/XX/XXXX. I promptly re-prepared my application for in-school deferment and documentation of my full-time, degree-seeking status. I submitted these documents through Aidvantage 's website. I received an auto-reply message similar to the one I received in XXXX, XXXX, which was never honored. I therefore decided to brave the lengthy queue and call Aidvantage once again. I spoke with another associate that same day, XX/XX/XXXX, who saw all the documentation I have described here. He asked for my date of enrollment and my expected graduation date, which I duly told him. He then said my deferment request would be processed. I asked about the upcoming payment due. He stated he would place my account once again into administrative forbearance so I would not have to make this payment. I took him at his word. Imagine my surprise to see on my account today that the administrative forbearance was not placed on my account, that all my loans have past-due notices, and that I owe for both XXXX and XXXX, XXXX, on my next due date of XX/XX/XXXX, a total of {$510.00}. 

Below, I have attached all of the official correspondence I have received from Aidvantage during this timeframe. 

I would like to stress here that I am not requesting loan forgiveness here. I am simply requesting the in-school deferment to which I am entitled and which has graced all other years of my XXXX education thus far. It seems to me that Aidvantage does not have systems or personnel in place to adequately handle the demands of their loan portfolio. I hope you can help.","","Maximus Education, LLC dba Aidvantage","MN","551XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-27,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8233258,2024

This remains in process as of today XX/XX/2023 without any clear update as to when this will be reviewed. I have submitted multiple inquiries regarding the status and attempting to expedite review with Aidvantage. Additionally I have utilized the Student Aid.gov grievance submission form on more than one occasion. I have not received any sort of meaningful communication from aidvantage aside from a message every few months stating they're reviewing my case. Most of my friends who graduated at the same time as I did have already been approved, therefore making managing their loans possible. I have been unable to have any control over or manage any of my loans since I graduated in XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Additionally I applied for student loan discharge as several of the loans were taken out on my behalf by a borrower who has since passed away. These loans were taken without my understanding what the implications were. Further loans that I had to take out were for a XXXX XXXX XXXX  that had ethically questionable practices and did not deliver what they promised to deliver per their handbook. I submitted information detailing many of the incidents that took place during my time in this program for review in XXXX XXXX Since then I have received correspondence from aidvantage several times stating there is someone reviewing my case without any clear update. 

Because of the delay, my loans have been placed on administrative forebearance WITHOUT my consent. Because of this I have not made any progress in paying back my loans or working toward forgiveness even though I am working for a company, accepting far less pay than my peers that is considered non-profit for the purpose of 10 year service based student loan forgiveness. Had my initial income driven repayment plan be reviewed in a timely way, I would be working toward my initial plan for forgiveness after 10 years. Since they placed my loans on administrative forebearance without my consent, my loans are continuing to accumulate interest at an alarming rate as I have now over {$220000.00} owed. This is becoming detrimental to my ability to ever overcome the substantial amount of debt that I've accrued in my time working to become a XXXX XXXX

I am never contacted and told why the requests are denied. I spoke with a supervisor name XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and he stated that he would put all of my loans in forbearance until the issue is resolved. I received a message yesterday that loans 4 and 7 are due for repayment. I am lied to every time I call.

2024-02-07,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","My student loans are serviced by Mohela and I am enrolled in Public Student Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ). When signing up for and XXXX plan prior to student loan repayment in XX/XX/2023, I was confused on Adjusted Gross Income ( XXXX ) and submitted Gross Income. Because of this my payments since XXXX of 2023 were {$430.00} per month. When I became aware of my mistake through conversations with friends also enrolled in XXXX and the XXXX plan, I submitted my application for the XXXX plan. My new amount due is {$210.00}. After submitting this in the early half of XXXX, Mohela put my account in forbearance and still withdrew the {$430.00} from my account. I was then informed that payment does not count toward PSLF since I was in forbearance. Similarly, Mohela put many loan holders in forbearance in XXXX, among which I was one. They then informed me those payments, auto-withdrawn from my account, even though my account was in forbearance, would not be eligible for XXXX due to the forbearance period. If those payments are not eligible, then I would like to be refunded. Similarly, if there is anyway to recoup the nearly double payments from XXXX through XXXX, that would be beneficial Also, I submitted a PSLF form on XX/XX/2023. It was not reviewed until XX/XX/XXXX, which is included. While it was taken care of with Mohela, all communications via their support option were sent after the form was processed. Overall, Mohela 's communication has been weak and inconsistent. I doubt I am the only one having this issue, which is why I submitted the complaint. I have overspent nearly {$1000.00} since repayments began and don't want others to run into this same problem.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","CO","80206","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-07,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8302260,2024

This indicated the servicer will choose a plan on the Student Aid Website. 

My First sent message to MOHELA was on XX/XX/XXXX, I asked for clarification on the IDR plan as it stated it should be {$0.00} a month based on my income but I received a monthly bill on XX/XX/XXXX of {$250.00} with interest accrued of {$28.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX automated processing delay message was received XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) I received a letter about being placed on SAVE but now my new monthly amount increased to {$300.00} XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) I received a letter MOHELA has placed an Administrative Forbearance on your account XX/XX/XXXX : Automated reply to my original message on XX/XX/XXXX it reiterated the letter about {$300.00} being calculated. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I replied reiterating my scenario of surviving paycheck to paycheck and indicated my XXXX and XXXX income and expressed that I believe the calculation was incorrect. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Received my first official new {$300.00} a month bill with no communication since my last message. 

XX/XX/XXXX : received an automated reply about working through applications in response to my XX/XX/XXXX message XX/XX/XXXX : I replied back about my forbearance ending in XXXX and pointed to the last message saying they are still working through applications. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Received a letter after I submitted a complaint to the XXXX. Issue # 1 : Monthly payment Amount, they reiterated the {$300.00} but in the next paragraph states, """" After researching your account, a previous application was found that was approved for a monthly payment amount of {$0.00} starting on XX/XX/XXXX. An expedited request has been placed to reinstate this repayment schedule. If approved, you will receive correspondence from MOHELA detailing your repayment amount and due date '' Then stated forbearance ends on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I request clarification and an update on the letter about {$0.00} repayment and got an auto reply of """" will respond within 15 business days '' XX/XX/XXXX : Next monthly bill of {$300.00} XX/XX/XXXX : I sent a message still seeking clarification on the original SAVE plan {$0.00} a month repayment letter I received from them on XX/XX/XXXX and expressing the dire situation this has created financially. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Also submitted a report with StudentAid.Gov - Feedback Case # XXXX, to this date I have not heard back any details. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Next monthly bill of {$300.00} XX/XX/XXXX : Automated message """" will respond within 15 business days '' for my XX/XX/XXXX message XX/XX/XXXX : Reply back to my XX/XX/XXXX message, Automated """" we apologize for any confusion or frustration, based on income information IDR is {$300.00} '' XX/XX/XXXX : I sent another message in response outlining my situation completely again asking for clarification and even pointing to the Federal Student Aid Website showcasing as a individual family size of 1 making $ XXXX or less is a {$0.00} a month on SAVE. I shared that my only w-2 income is a total of {$16000.00} for XXXX. I also reiterated my income for XXXX was {$0.00}. I then said I didn't even make enough in XXXX to fall in the bracket for a {$300.00} + monthly payment on SAVE. I also indicated that his specific message was a direct follow up from the XX/XX/XXXX which was 33 business days with no real answer. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Sent a blank repayment plan application XX/XX/XXXX : Next Monthly bill of {$300.00} XX/XX/XXXX : Resent monthly bill for XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : Received a collections call from MOHELA XX/XX/XXXX : Again sent another message reiterating my specific situation and stated it has become somewhat predatory in nature. 

Additionally, I have attempted to call a few times but been put on hold for hours, hung up on, or pass around with no indication that anybody would be able to resolve my issue. I am at my wits end completely on managing this situation as I feel like I have been extremely timely and responsive to the various communications sent to me and completed my applications prior to when repayment should have begun. 

I will attach some documents and overview of messages.

2024-03-04,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I applied for the IDR in XX/XX/XXXX when it initially was open for loan borrowers to apply. I submitted my information with the understanding that they would pull my XXXX salary from my XXXX tax record. Prior to the new IDR plans I believe I was paying under the XXXX plan before COVID and then paused making payments during COVID. For my new application I applied for the XXXX plan to ensure my payments to better reflected my current financial status. The application was completed ( as stated on the XXXX website ) and sent to my loan servicer Nelnet. I received a letter from them stating that my payment would be XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Which was cheaper than my previous payment under the XXXX. I then received a second letter stating that I had requested an adjustment and my monthly payment increased to XXXX ( slightly more than what I paid under the XXXX plan. I did not request an adjustment. I contacted both Federal Student Aid and Nelnet ( my original loan servicer ) in early XXXX when I noted the discrepancy. After being redirected back and forth between the two institutes multiple times, spanning multiple days I finally spoke with a representative at Nelnet ( XX/XX/XXXX ) that stated they received two separate IDR applications in XXXX. Confirmation with a representative at Federal Student Aid stated I only had my initial XX/XX/XXXX application and no additional application in XXXX of XXXX. When I requested a copy of both applications from Nelnet they refused stating that because it was transferred to them via electronically, they had no feasible way to send this information to me. When I requested written confirmation via email or the Nelnet portal in regards to this representative who does see and can confirm XXXX separate applications that were 'approved ' they refused. Upon further questioning the Nelnet representative stated that my IDR was based on an income of approximately {$72000.00}. My XXXX for taxes in XXXX was {$9000.00}. When I pull my record of the XXXX application of XX/XX/XXXX, I can not see where I listed approx. {$72000.00} or that the IRS sent information stating I made approx. {$72000.00} in XXXX. Following this the a customer representative from XXXX recommended I submit a complain through studentaid.gov. I completed this on XX/XX/XXXX and never got a response back. I called XX/XX/XXXX for an update and the Ombudsman service representative stated that after my initial application in XX/XX/XXXX they completed an update to the XXXX servicing site/IDR process ( or something along those lines ) and that my XXXX application was canceled. Hence why Nelnet sent out the second letter in XX/XX/XXXX. This entire time I thought the application had been submitted and approved. I asked why I was never notified of this canceled application or at least notified to resubmit my application and she stated that due to the upgrade in service it just never happened and wasn't apart of how they approached the rollout or the update. I believe this is basic negligence on FSA part as this incorrect information has traveled from Nelnet to now my new servicer XXXX. The XXXX ombudsman stated on the phone that in my application they could see where I put my income as XXXX. On my copy of the application I don't see that listed anywhere. Even if it was listed on the XX/XX/XXXX application, per what I was told, they can't explain to me how they were okay to use that information on the application when they told me that it ended up canceled. I have been told a lot of contradicting information surrounding these errors and the fingers are being pointed in a lot of directions with XXXX accountable from the loan servicer, Nelnet, or XXXX.","","Nelnet, Inc.","MI","XXXXX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8468543,2024

Under the terms of the loan agreement, payments made within XXXX of the disbursement are applied entirely to the principal balance and any fees and accumulated interest are refunded accordingly. This payment was within the 120 day period and was to pay the entire remaining balance, but it incorrectly applied a portion of the payment towards interest. 

The representative I spoke to said this would be adjusted on my account and that I would receive a check with a refund of any fees and interest and that once corrected, the balance will show XXXX, so I do not need to take any further action on this loan to pay it off. 

However, when I attempted to follow up via email to confirm this information, I have received XXXX response. The balance on my account kept increasing because interest was accruing. And having no response over and over again from Nelnet, I paid the remaining balance ( which was interest that I should not have been charged for because the payment was made within 120 days ) so that the balance would not continue to increase and risk having to pay that as a result of Nelnet 's incompetence. 

Nelnet has refused to respond. Their call center places you on hold for HOURS, effectively blocking you from getting any kind of meaningful customer service. If they don't respond to ANY emails, and you have to wait hours on hold, how is this issue supposed to be resolved? They owe me hundreds and hundreds of dollars of interest and fees that I should NOT have been charged for and they just ignore me now. They are in breach of contract and are not acting in good faith.

I did however use deferment and forbearance options for both my Private Signature Loans and FFEL/consolidation loans. I continued to do so until I ran out of deferment and forbearances on my Private Loans. The problem was that when I became delinquent on those Private Loans, Sallie Mae who was my servicer at the time, would not speak to me or help me deal with my FFEL/Consolidation Loans. Eventually because of the wasted time, frustration, I gave up and the loans went into default. 

My employment was generally freelance and erratic with some stability at times with a university research position where I was considered a temporary employee without any benefits. I had low/irregular income most years after graduation then after the Global Financial Crises in XXXX became completely unemployed. I had tried submitting a low income deferment, but kept getting denial letters. When I would call to discuss the denial with Sallie Mae I would connect with representatives who would harass me about paying my Private Loans, when I simply wanted to speak to someone who could talk to me about my Federal Loans. I would get transferred to someone else who was supposed to help, but would get the same story about them not being able to help. I was transferred and transferred again to never get anywhere in the end. I was even told by at least one representative that they couldn't help me with the Federal Loans until I set up a payment for the private loans. 

At some point I was told the documents I had submitted were unreadable. Once they received acceptable copies, I was told the documents where then out of date because they had become to old to use in the time it took for them to receive and process. I gave up figuring I was just wasting my time with Sallie Mae. The Federal Loans went into default and my tax return was garnished completely. Of course that was upsetting, but at the same time my credit was already destroyed because of the Private Loans and was also sued by Sallie Mae for those loans. I went into bankruptcy, which paused the legal proceedings for the Private Loans. Luckily, the statute of limitations ran out on Sallie Mae, but the judge gave them a year to refile, which they never did. 

In the meantime after bankruptcy I had to try and reestablish my credit and my life. I had already consolidated my loans once before and could not do that again, so my only choice was rehabilitation, which was also fraught with problems from the servicer ( XXXX  ). I got through and finally about 10 years ago was able to get on the IBR plan. Since then, life has been a little easier, but the years of turmoil, struggle, and lies from Sallie Mae caused me a lot of pain emotionally, but also physically as the stress aggravated my XXXX XXXX The egregious actions and business practices of Sallie Mae have left me metaphorically and literally injured financially and physically. I wish something could be done to rectify the injustice that I've had to live with for decades.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","ECMC GROUP, INC.","FL","34655","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-14,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8238457,2024

This was in XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  when I had one payment made with autopay, the first payment after the national forbearance ending. I received my next statement ( a different amount than the payment I just made ) and then the payment never went through in XXXX. I confirmed I was still in Autopay so this is when I assumed I was placed into forbearance. Banners on their website talked about people placed into forbearance but I never received this notice. For more information, I did apply to re-new my IDR plan at this time, as directed by email, and never received any confirmation until XX/XX/XXXX. 

Then in XXXX all of my loans show past due, I received no correspondence on payments resuming, only my loans now showing past due. I sent an email asking why and had no response.

I have no idea what the status of my loans are, if I am in forbearance or if I actually have a past due amount or not.

I filled out my application for IDR/SAVE on XX/XX/XXXX via the studentaid.gov website. Noticing my application wasn't processed after the XXXX  day processing time, I called MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that I need to resubmit my income self-certification because it was never received ( even though it was uploaded on the studentaid.gov website.

MOHELA then placed me on administrative forbearance and continued to charge me thousands of dollars in interest and application was still not processed. The administrative forbearance ended on XX/XX/XXXX and I was charged a monthly payment of about {$3400.00} ( when my SAVE plan payment should've been {$300.00} ). My account therefore went into default. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke with XXXX who transferred me to the advanced team and I spoke with XXXX. XXXX was helpful but did not offer an explanation for why application has still not been processed. XXXX stated that if I pay {$5.00} immediately over the phone she can process the application. I promptly complied and paid the {$5.00}.

After some additional delays my account now shows that I am in the SAVE plan and that my first payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX. However I still have the following XXXX  problems that I contacted MOHELA regarding at least XXXX times both by phone and email. 

1 ) My account was charged {$10000.00} in interest that should '' ve never been charged had I been allowed to make my monthly payments. I would like to get this money refunded. The XXXX XXXX stated that people in my situation will not be charged interest until matter is resolved. But I can't get MOHELA to honor the directive. 

2 ) Due to the delays, my account is in default. I called regarding this on XXXXXX/XX/XXXX and was told that my account should've never been taken out of forbearance while waiting and that the finance department will be contacted to fix this and take my account out of default. This still has yet to happen and my account is past due for about {$3700.00}. I am concerned that the default will not allow my future payments to be accurately applied to my monthly payment and therefore I will miss out on the subsidies that the SAVE plan provides.

I work for one employer. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
I get paid twice a month over 12 months. 

sent this email to Nelnet just now : You refuse to process my SAVE application and this has been ongoing since XX/XX/XXXX. I have reported you to the federal government, filed numerous complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and with the Ombudsman. I am a person with a XXXX. 

You keep charging me illegally and have illegally taken me out of administrative forbearance starting XX/XX/XXXX. This is illegal, as you still have not put me in the SAVE program, so I am supposed to be in administrative forbearance until you place me in the SAVE program. 

According to federal law, you have to put me in the SAVE program as I qualify for it and you have not. Also according to federal law, you can not charge me more than my AGI and my AGI for the year XXXX was {$68000.00} and the federal government said my payment is supposed to be {$190.00} dollars under SAVE. 

I demand you immediately place me back in administrative forbearance until you place me in the SAVE program and charge me the 10 % of my discretionary income based on my AGI of {$68000.00}. I have uploaded paystubs repeatedly showing you I get paid twice monthly over 12 months. You continue to ask me for my pay frequency despite this. 

I am going to get a lawyer and sue your for fraud and illegal activities if you do not immediately place me in the SAVE program I qualify for. I have notified 4 federal agencies and Congress over this and as a person with a XXXX, you are stressing me out and worsening it. I will also join the class-action lawsuit for your negligence to use the information that I have provided to you to enroll me in SAVE. 

There is no place in my account when I am logged in to send a message, nor to reply to one sent to me on Nelnet. I demand you place the ability to respond to and send messages on Nelnet on my account. 

Again, it is illegal under FEDERAL LAW to charge me more than 10 % of my discretionary income based on my AGI for SAVE PROGRAM. 

Action requested : IMMEDIATE RELIEF REQUESTED : Put me back in administrative forbearance until you enroll me in SAVE.

Process my SAVE application and enroll me in SAVE. 
Stop asking me for """" employer XXXX '' when I have XXXX employer, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Do not even attempt to do ANYTHING to my credit report or I will sue you and call a press conference as this is illegal. If you even try to even say I am delinquent on my payments when I am supposed to be in administrative forbearance while you enroll me in SAVE, I will sue you. 
Stop charging me interest as this is illegal while I am in, and have been in, administrative forbearance due to Nelnet illegally not enrolling me in SAVE. 

All of this communication has been sent to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as evidence you have so been told what actions I demand you take and the consequences if you continue to illegally charge me over 10 % of my discretionary income under SAVE.

The Department of Education ( DOE ) lists my IDR recertification ( AKA IDR anniversary data ) date as XXXX i've attached proof from the DOE 's XXXX website account. The DOE recently made a legal pronouncement, as seen on their website, that because this recertification date falls before XX/XX/XXXX, it should be pushed out by one year.

I am emailing you because MOHELA refuses to comply with this law. 

I contacted MOHELA via phone on XX/XX/XXXX to bring this to their attention. During a 2 hour phone call where I spoke with multiple agents, they assured me that my date would be pushed back by one year to XXXX. I asked for confirmation in writing, but the agents said they would not provide confirmation. Then, my call was dropped, while I waited on hold to speak with a supervisor. So, I then sent a message to MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX via their secure message portal formally requesting that my date be pushed out XXXX year. I received no response. 

I then contacted XXXX XXXX at MOHELA, via email. He is a complaint analyst, who spoke with me on the phone on XX/XX/XXXX. He assured me that my issue would be rectified immediately, and he would contact me within 24 hours to rectify the issue. He also indicated on the phone call that the issue appeared very clear cut, and therefore was confused why it had taken so long to rectify. 

Despite his assurance I would be contacted within 24 hours, I was not. I emailed him after 48 hours, and have still not heard back.

They still informed me that they could NOT give me a timeframe or any way to follow up with the department that handles refunds. On XX/XX/XXXX, still no refund. I call customer service and request to speak with a supervisor. They stated that one would call me back in 24-48 hours. They called me back when I was at work and could not answer the call. I repeated this process about 2 more times, each time the call back coming through at a random time the next day and not where I could answer. My XX/XX/XXXX statement was also showing that they had already refunded the overpayment in XXXX... .that never happened. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and I still have not received the refund of {$500.00} that THEY mistakenly took from my bank account. I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and have never experienced this type of financial business model where the financial institution mistakenly takes more money from the customer than what was agreed to, then tells the customer that they can """" give no time frame for when that refund will be processed '' AND not give the customer any way to follow up, AND show on a financial statement that the refund has processed WHEN IT HAS NOT! It has been three months and I have still not received my refund that is due to me.

She advised I borrow {$40000.00}. Discover Private Student Education Loans responded immediately with an approval. XX/XX/2018 I called the bank and was told the XXXX had approved {$36000.00}. When I called the XXXX I was told checks of that size required two signatures and the XXXX was on vacation and my only option was to wait for him to return. Discover had assured me it was in my best interest to take a variable rate to keep my payments low, as they would simply refinance them in case I needed more assistance. Weeks later the XXXX returned and my check was mailed to me. After multiple grievances with the skelton staff, price gouging, and rare availability to me as a distance enrolled student. Months later it became evident this was simply common practice. As I let them know the money I was borrowing for little to no instruction was unacceptable. As I quickly found another program, I gave them proper notice. They promptly further informed me I would need to pay for the semester they had enrolled me before giving notice, I refused. Now having XXXX XXXX XXXX from a reputable program COVID was slowing down and, as instructed, I called Discover back as we had previously arranged to reduce the rates and lock them around 2 %. I was told the offer was not available, and rates could only be locked at 8 % and 11 % respectively. They allowed me another year through another special program for borrowers just like me. I accepted, once again believing in a year things would be better, and rates would go down as promised. They never went down. At just over $ 500 monthly I have lost my job and am unable to make these payments. As the bank states that have no options for me, I now am near defaulting for the first time ever on a student loan.

I enrolled in autopay starting in XX/XX/year>. Since that time, I have been making payments on my account. At some point my balance increased on my loans from around $ XXXX to $ XXXX. I contacted Aidvantage and they relayed to me that anytime I am placed in forbearance I get automatically dis-enrolled from autopay. They also automatically enroll me into forbearance, this is not a choice I have. Due to FEMA/government auto enrolling me into forbearance for a disaster in my area ( no major disasters that I am aware of around XXXX Michigan ) , my payment was {$0.00} but apparently I continued to accrue interest on my loans. When I reached out to Aidvantage, they stated they could not do anything. They also stated there is no option for me to manage my own forbearance. Instead I can get auto-enrolled, and if this occurs I have to reach out to them and dis-enroll. Regardless of the future, I find it unreasonable that I did not sign up for forbearance, was automatically enrolled, accrued interest on my loans when I could have continued making payments ( which I thought i was due to autopay not realizing forbearance removes autopay ), and now have overall higher balance. Seems like a system that cheats the loan borrower. If FEMA automatically enrolls loan borrower into forbearance, it should be an administrative forbearance where interest does not accrue.","","Maximus Education, LLC dba Aidvantage","MI","480XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-07,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8494406,2024

I consolidated by loans awaiting action pending my defense to repayment which was filed almost a decade ago. The department of education agreed I was defrauded and issued a letter that my loans were to be cancelled. After waiting years and filing disputes, still no action has been taken. The department of education provided guidance that in order to be eligible for cancellation that I would have to consolidate my loans, which I applied to. The Department provided that I was approved for the SAVE plan and sent my info the AiAdvantage, the servicer. NO ACTION has been taken on my loans. The information on the website is lists administrative forbearance with payment due more than a decade from now, but is actively reporting on my credit as due even though the balances are incorrect. Its not clear what is happening or why. The balances reflected make no sense. Where is my loan cancellation, why has the SAVE plan that I was apparently approved for not executed? Where are the credits applied towards cancellation? Agents from all agencies cant articulate what is happening. Only that I'm in process, but they dont event know what I'm in process for. The information provided is incorrect and incomplete. 

My student loans have been subject to numerous enforcement actions- All which ( as written by the Department of Education ) were to result in full discharge and cancellation many years ago. Despite this, I am yet to obtain ANY of the cancellations and discharges of debt promised. I continue to be charged compounding interest multiplying the student loan debt which was to be cancelled in its entirety. Therefore, I am disputing the entire student loan balance as invalid. The department of education approved my Borrower Defense to repayment acknowledging that I among many other students had been defrauded by my university and suffered for many years. I continue to be financially impacted by the compounding interest, lost opportunities and negative impact to my credit score resulting in paying more despite being a financially responsible person.

I have paid on my loans since XXXX and thanks to Nelnet, now they are all reset to be paid on for another 25 years. My loans were going to be forgiven in 13 years before Nelnet illy advised me.

2. Nelnet convinced me to consolidate my loans so that all of my loans would benefit being under the SAVE Plan. Upon consolidation, they reached out once saying my IDR application is in progress. My statements say I owe XXXX dollars a month now and my application status hasnt changed or been updated since XXXX. When you call them, you get someone who tells you to relax and that even though theres no record of your IDR application on Nelnet website, that they are just busy. Keep in mind it takes about 2 hours to talk to someone who has no idea what they are talking about. They are just trying to calm people down, not resolve anything.

3. As it stands, all of my emails about the status of my IDR application have been answered with generic responses that say stuff like : we might place you on an administrative forbearance, so dont pay attention to our emails saying you owe {$2000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. 

4. Nobody at Nelnet can tell me the status of my IDR application that I submitted in XX/XX/XXXX.

'' I was confused and unaware of what they were talking about, so I assumed this was some sort of scam, but after further discussion with EdFinancial, I learned it was real. They claimed my account was XXXX days past due - which was completely false. 
( I enrolled in auto pay payments in XXXX of XXXX to prepare for the resuming student loan repayments beginning in XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, for the amount of {$160.00}, my first payment in my repayment plan was processed on time for the correct amount. Each month since, my payments have been processed as scheduled for the correct amount of {$160.00} and I have received confirmation for each payment. ) The woman I spoke with seemingly had no clue how my account would be XXXX days past due, and she saw that payments were being charged for XX/XX/XXXX, which she herself claimed wasn't possible because federal repayments were not scheduled to begin until XX/XX/XXXX, which is when I properly began my auto-pay. I had never received an alert on my account about this past due error until I received that phone call. I asked the woman for written documentation about my situation, and she told me they could not do that. Instead, she placed my account on XXXX XXXX and told me to wait and not do anything, and she would bring my account current. The call ended and I still had never received any documentation of this occurrence. This phone call lasted XXXX minutes. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, a day before my XXXX statement would be paid, I checked my account on EdFinancial, and the past due alert was gone. I assumed all was returned to normal. My usual payment of {$160.00} was processed on XX/XX/XXXX. Today, however, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email notification for a message about my account on EdFinancial. Upon logging in, I saw that my next payment due in XXXX was for the amount of {$270.00}, far larger than my past 4 monthly payments. I called EdFinancial at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, and again, told them how I never received documentation about the past due error that THEY made, and now my account is showing a very large amount due for XXXX that I was NEVER notified or warned about. Upon speaking with a different woman, she, again, had no clue how this happened to my account. I was placed on several short holds as she tried to get an answer. Ultimately, I was told that it was probably larger because after """" my account was brought current, it reallocated my loans and created a larger payment. '' I asked if it could be returned to {$160.00} as I previously have been paying, and she told me no, that it can not be changed. She said, """" For the missed payments and your account being brought current, these things happen. There's nothing we can do. '' I told her, """" I haven't missed payments, this happened because there was an error on EdFinancial 's side. '' She kept telling me she understood but there was nothing I could do, and she recommended I change to a XXXX plan. I told her I was frustrated and confused and did not feel like I received any answers. Furthermore, I told her that I wanted an email describing these events, and, once again, I was told that they can't do that. I asked to speak to someone else with the power to do that, and she said, """" No one can do that. '' This call lasted XXXX minutes. I feel cheated and confused. I don't know what I am going to do about my payments, because {$270.00} is an amount I can not comfortably afford.

They will not provide me an update or documentation of the status or details of the request. They also will not respond to XXXX 's request for information.

They have also failed to respond to XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. I need them to take action in a reasonable and clear time frame. 

Key Dates and Actions : XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  I made a payment of {$30000.00} to XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I made a payment of {$12000.00} to XXXX, Payment Confirmation # : XXXX Payment Confirmation # : XXXX 

XX/XX/XXXX, I messaged XXXX using their XXXX XXXX form to request a refund and inquire about XXXX information. The form was located at https : //customercareform.edfinancial.com/. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I received a billing statement, with no history of recent payments. On the first page, the Last Payment Received listed {$0.00}. And the Loan detail page, for all loans, included Loan XXXX, listed Payment Received as {$0.00} and Last Payment Date as XX/XX/XXXX. This lead me to believe my refund request was in the process of being reversed. See screenshots below : XX/XX/XXXX I used the contact form again to follow up on the refund and ask for my payment history. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with an EdFinancial representative named XXXX who said they had not documented my request. 

XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX I spoke with EdFinancial representative named XXXX who said he documented the request and sent it to XXXX XXXX. He said after loan servicing processes it, it will be sent to XXXX of XXXX, who then sends it to Treasury. 

XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  : I called and requested a supervisor. They say they put in the request and the supervisor will call back within XXXX. I never received a call back. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I talked to the XXXX Ombudsman. They escalated my case with them in hopes of resolving it before my loans are transferred to XXXX for XXXX. They also advised that EdFinancial is responsible for submitting the refund request and does not need Dept. of Educations permission to submit it. They do not know why EdFinancial is failing to submit the request. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Called into EdFinancial. The representative hung up on me or the call got disconnected. They did not call me back. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Later that same day, i called EdFinancial again. An EdFinancial staff member reviewed my request and assured me the refund would be processed and returned to my account. She said it with absolute certainty and confidence that it would be refunded, even if it was after my loans were transferred or consolidated. That I should just wait 30 days and then call back. She said to be safe, maybe call back """" in XXXX or XXXX we'll have an update. '' I asked her if EdFinancial handles the refund request after I transfer to XXXX. She confirmed yes. However, I would later be advised on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  that I should re-request it through XXXX. 


XX/XX/XXXX : My loans were listed as {$0.00} in EdFinancials site and began transferring to XXXX. EdFinancial reps began telling me the refund would still pending and with their XXXX team. 

XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with an EdFinancial rep who suggested I compile documentation of my request dating back to my efforts since XX/XX/XXXX. She advised that the XXXX XXXX department was not submitting the request to Dept of Education at this time. Either because they didn't think they would approve it and XXXX aren't processing refunds at this time. Regardless, I felt I had a right to timely processing of my requests. 

XX/XX/XXXX At the advice of an EdFinancial rep, I compiled the documentation Ive tracked over the last few months and shared it with EdFinancial via their customer service inbox at XXXX This included key steps taken, forms submitted, calls logged, and internet history, along with additional notes of activities in a spreadsheet. 

XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  I received a supervisor callback from XXXX, a supervisor at EdFinancial. XXXX advised me they did not yet have access to the documentation I sent by email on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  and that it may take up to 30 days to be processed by email. XXXX suggested I may need to process the refund through XXXX, but could call EdFinancial until my case is formally closed. He advised me that my many reasons for a refund request were typically permissible and had approved refunds for similar reasons in the past, under covid forebearance pause, before the pause and even after the covid pause. But something to do with the covid pause was making it more challenging to approve and process. 

XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  : I received an email response from EdFinancial to my XX/XX/XXXX email, advising me they received the documentation but that I would now need to process the refund through XXXX because they are now my loan servicer. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I spoke with XXXX at the XXXX ombudsman office. She confirmed that I should resubmit my refund request to XXXX for processing, with specific mention that my refund request was first submitted on XXXX XXXX XXXX prior to the XX/XX/XXXX deadline. She also suggested I document EdFinancials response on my open case with XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX I emailed XXXX at XXXX to provide documentation and formally re-request the refund.

I have been enrolled as a SAVE borrower since XX/XX/XXXX. Prior to that, I consolidated my federal loans. When repayments began in XXXXXXXX XXXX, I was well prepared, and I had received a notice ( attached ) alerting me to the fact that my income qualifies me to pay {$0.00} in monthly payments, and also, I accrue 0 % interest on my loans. In XXXX, {$13000.00} ( two loans ) were serviced by AidVantage, and {$55000.00} ( three loans ) were serviced by XXXX. The sum of all my loans combined was locked at an unwavering {$69.00}, XXXX. 
Each month, I audit my accounts- federal loan accounts, investment portfolios, car note, credit cards, etc. I balance assets against liabilities. XXXX, my AidVantage and XXXX accounts have remained at {$13000.00} and {$55000.00}, respectively. 
Come XXXX, there was a change. Upon logging into my XXXX account, my loans are deemed """" paid in full. '' I did not receive any email correspondence in my XXXX  inbox account ( or any linked email inbox ). After much digging, I found a notice ( also attached ) from XXXX alerting me that my loans will be transferred to AidVantage, so that AidVantage can oversee ALL of my loans. In this notice, XXXX stated that """" This transfer will not impact the existing terms, conditions, interest rate, or available repayment plans of your federal student loans. '' I then logged into my AidVantage, and soon discovered that my loans did not appear to transfer as smoothly as promised. All 5 of my federal loans were listed, but only the original two that AidVantage had been overseeing were consolidated, and receiving the benefits of the SAVE plan. The three loans incoming from XXXX were unconsolidated, no longer enrolled in the SAVE plan, and gaining interest quickly. On account of this, I had a payment due for XXXX -- I was alarmed, to say the least. Here, too, I dug around in my account until I was able to find a link to an account inbox that held my statements and other notices. There was no notice pertaining to loan transfer. There was a statement for the current bill, in the amount of XXXX -- That statement was dated XX/XX/XXXX. It was XX/XX/XXXX. The bill corresponding to this statement was due XX/XX/XXXX - the very next day. I went to FSA.gov and speedily reconsolidated all my loans, and re-enrolled for the SAVE plan ( even though I was not due for renewal until XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX  I thought by taking matters into my own hands to reduce bills and stop interest would be the best option. XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX was a Saturday and Sunday, and I could not place a call to AidVantage, XXXX, or FSA.gov. 
Come Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I had a balance of XXXX -- due with AidVantage : a late XXXX -- and XXXX 's XXXX -- compiled on top. I called AidVantage and spoke to an agent who claimed that upon loan transfers, the terms and conditions set by a previous loan service company are not transferrable, and doing what I did ( without being told ) to reconsolidate and re-enroll in SAVE was """" exactly what I should have done. '' I mentioned that under the SAVE plan, my loans never grew interest ( 0 % ) and I never had a payment, and she said that is false, because all loans gain interest. I can assure you, this is not the case, as I was looking at the grand sum of {$69000.00} for months prior to now. I was able to request that she place my account in forebearance, and she unwillingly obliged. This then reduced my payments back to $ 0 monthly dues. But - the interest still grew, even with all five loans in forbearance.

In the interim, I called AidVantage to again ask for loan interest to be halted and refunded ( I am waiting 30-45 days for my loan reconsolidation/SAVE re-enrollment efforts to be approved ), and was told that is not something they can do, as they do not control interest rates ( of course, not, but again, this answer did not satisfy the question I was asking. They are businesspeople through and through who twist scripts and confuse you purposely ). Unhappy with that answer, I called XXXX and spoke to an agent who was able to look into my account and she told me that AidVantage certainly """" messed things up '' and she has only ever heard of smooth transfers, where loans should never come out of consolidation or be stripped of their payment plan benefits. 
Over the weekend of XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, I also submitted a complaint to FSA.gov after selecting the """" dealing with my loan servicer '' description to submit my feedback. My complaint is dated XX/XX/XXXX. I received a reply today, XX/XX/XXXX, stating that FSA.gov is unable to answer questions or hear complaints akin to mine, and that I should deal with AidVantage. There is no complaint forum on AidVantage 's website. After speaking with two of their agents, I am confident that my experience will be manipulated and spun in a different direction, further away from a fair resolution.","","Maximus Education, LLC dba Aidvantage","MA","027XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-31,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8251045,2024

I requested auto pay again just to be sure and made a manual payment just now since the website was saying my payment was overdue. I attached the following screenshots : 1. Confirmation that my auto payment of XXXX went through on XX/XX/XXXX along with my manual payment made today, 2. My email from XX/XX/XXXX that confirms I set up auto pay, 3. Confirmation that I am receiving the 0.25 % interest decrease for being enrolled in autopay, and 4. The alert I received about being in forbearance.

I want the servicer Edfinancial Services to act in good faith when making an offer, I acted in good faith and made every effort to accept their offer of a decreased rate of interest for auto payment which is clearly stated through out their website. 
I tried enrolling online for autopay as soon as I discovered who my servicer was, well before the first bill arrived, no success, I believe it was the first week in XXXX that I finally was able to enter my banking information. Even so there was nothing to notify the user ( me ) on the website of successful enrollment. Not receiving a """" congratulations you have enrolled '' page I eventually gave up. 
I got my first bill in the post, the document states I am not enrolled in auto pay. 
I return to the website, try to enroll again. Same results, XXXX feedback that I have complete the request successfully. 
On a lark, I make a call, I speak with a lovey capable person. They inform me that the system is backlogged and auto enroll will take 3 months to kick in ; as long as you dont try to enroll in auto pay again because the 3 months starts from the date of the last request. 
I was also informed that I am not required make any payments until autopay starts. I asked if interest accrues during this time, the response was yes. Anyone that paid attention in High School Home Econ class knows that adding interest to the principle increases the total amount of interest a borrowers has to pay. Any behavioral scientist will tell you, that every time someone gets a bill that states autopay """" not enrolled '', that person is going to try to enroll, which starts the process a new and thus never ever, ever be successful in achieving the lower rate.","","EdFinancial Services","AZ","85719","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-17,"Untimely response","No","N/A",8165169,2024

1. **Failure to Provide Validation Information : ** US DEPT OF EDUCATION has placed a collection on my consumer report without providing the required validation information, as outlined in 12 CFR 1006.34 ( b ) ( 5 ). I have not received any documentation supporting the legitimacy of the debt in question.

2. **Denial of Dispute Rights : ** I have not been given the opportunity to dispute the account, a clear violation of 12 CFR 1006.34 ( c ) ( 4 ) ( I ). I request the chance to dispute the alleged debt and receive all relevant information regarding the account. 

XXXX. **False, Misleading, and Deceptive Practices : ** The collection agency has engaged in false, misleading, and deceptive means in violation of consumer rights. I demand that the US DEPT OF EDUCATION ceases such practices immediately.

4. **Failure to Provide Disclosures : ** US DEPT OF EDUCATION has furnished information to a consumer reporting agency without providing required disclosures, violating 12 CFR 1006.34 ( d ) and 15 USC 1681-S 2 ( 7 ) ( A ).

5. **Cease and Desist Order : ** I dispute all debts claimed by the US DEPT OF EDUCATION , and I hereby revoke all rights for them to communicate with me. Any violation of this order and subsequent contact after this complaint will be considered a breach under 15 USC 1692K FDCPA, and they will owe {$1000.00} for each violation.

6. **Request for Documentation : ** I am also formally requesting a copy of the purchase agreement/ promissory note between the US DEPT OF EDUCATION and the original collector. Furthermore, I demand proof of their licensing and bonding status to ensure their legal authority in pursuing the alleged debt. 

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and request a thorough investigation into the actions of the US DEPT OF EDUCATION. I trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will take the necessary steps to address these violations and protect consumers from unfair debt collection practices.

Despite my repeated attempts to rectify these inaccuracies, including direct communication and provision of evidence to the credit reporting agencies, the wrongful information persists. Under the FCRA, you are obligated to conduct a thorough and reasonable investigation of disputed information upon receipt of a consumers dispute. Failure to do so, as evidenced in my case, is a direct violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ). 

I have never knowingly entered into any agreement or contract with XXXX or Aidvantage. The documentation provided by XXXX in response to my request for proof of debt was grossly inaccurate, containing information and a name not attributable to me. This is a clear violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), which requires credit reporting agencies to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates. 

Moreover, Aidvantage has completely neglected to respond to my requests for validation, further exacerbating the issue. This non-compliance is an infringement of my rights under the FCRA and demonstrates a lack of due diligence required by law. 

The ongoing misreporting of my credit history has led to significant financial loss, reputational damage, and emotional distress. This situation is further compounded by the fact that I have been a victim of identity theft, a circumstance that has been aggravated by the widely reported XXXX data breach. Despite providing substantial evidence to support my claims of identity theft, as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2, my documentation has been repeatedly overlooked for 2+ years now. I have compiled multiple certified green receipts between these companies showing proof that I have repeatedly mailed via USPS documentation proving these accounts to be inaccurate, incomplete and not mine and XXXX, XXXX and XXXX continue to willfully report this false information on my CONSUMER file on behalf of XXXX and Aidvantage. 

To date, the resolution of disputes I filed, most recently on XX/XX/2024, has been grossly mishandled. Notices from XXXX, for instance, declare the account in question as certified by both companies without providing requisite proof. This approach not only contravenes the FCRA stipulations for accuracy and verification but also my rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act ( CCPA ), which emphasizes fair and respectful treatment of consumers in the credit marketplace. 

The negligence exhibited by your organizations in handling my credit information is a clear violation of the FCRA, particularly sections pertaining to the accuracy and integrity of credit reporting ( 15 U.S. Code 1681e and 1681i ). This negligence has cost me time, money, and a significant detriment to my financial reputation and enjoyment of life. 

Consequently, I demand the immediate and complete removal of all false information from my consumer file. Should this issue not be resolved promptly and satisfactorily, I am prepared to escalate this matter by filing formal complaints with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), the XXXX XXXX XXXX, the federal Bureau of Investigation, ( FBI ) and pursue legal action in the appropriate civil courts.

1. I was one of the borrowers placed on administrative forbearance for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX due to account updates and billing date issues. At the time was very confusing due to the fact I am on track for XXXX. I received a formal notice about why this was taken place on XX/XX/XXXX. Prior it was multiple calls with different reps and trying to get information from social media. This has caused so much stress. Also, it is XX/XX/XXXX and the XXXX month is not being counted towards my XXXX, in fact is not appearing at all. ( please see attach document ). I have called multiple times, and was told it will update with IDR adjustment, in XX/XX/XXXX or by the end of the month. Extremely inconsistent and I am left to wonder what is going on and if I am ever going to be XXXX. Is my payment count ever going to be updated. 

XXXX. There needs to be a message regarding processing payments. Basically, I paid my XXXX bill on time XX/XX/XXXX. My payment was taken from my account and on XX/XX/XXXX. I received a pass due bill stating I owed XXXX and XXXX. This was extremely upsetting, I spent time calling my bank, XXXX minutes for a call from Mohela. The rep was extremely nice and explained he was not sure why but could be due to the processing time. I suggested for them to have a message on the site, explaining this. I almost had a XXXX XXXX thinking there was something wrong with my payment. Again, I am playing on a loan that should be forgiven, since I have been working in public service since for more than 10 years. ( see attach documentation ) XXXX. Lastly there has not been any updates since my loan was sent to review back in XX/XX/XXXX to the department of education. Every time I call they say no updates and to wait. There is no notice on when this is going to be taking place. Moreover, specific payment of XXXX  waiver for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX are not being counted. A random forbearance for XX/XX/XXXX is also not being counted it. I spoke to a supervisor, and an XXXX  ombudsman and apparently I was told Mohela is refusing to count it, until the XXXX waiver. When is this going to be reviewed on my account. For XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX proof of payment was submitted and any deferment placed should not be there.

I asked for consolidation around XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, loans 1 and 2 were forgiven. According to the Dept. of Education, Mohela ( my service provider ) was to have adjusted the consolidation request so that loans 1 and 2 were not part of the consolidation. Mohela failed to do so. Accordingly, a consolidation loan of over {$90000.00} was issued to satisfy my four loans. But loans 1 and 2 were already discharged effective XX/XX/XXXX... so what happened to the loan amounts that were supposed to pay off loans 1 and 2? I never received the loan proceeds for loans 1 and 2 and they could not have been applied to payoff loans that were discharged effective 3 years prior. Nonetheless, Mohela inexplicable says I owe over {$110000.00} when they know 2 of the loans that were part of the consolidation were forgiven prior to consolidation and my amount should be much lower, i.e. about {$40000.00}. They have repeatedly stated they would adjust my account but do not do so. As recently as XX/XX/XXXX, a supervisor with Mohela said my account would be adjusted within 14 business days -- and it is 2 days past that deadline with no adjustment. I can not make payments on my legitimate loan amount because Mohela refuses to adjust my account, adjust my payment to accurately reflect what I owe in principle, or forward to me the consolidation loan proceeds that could not have been applied to loans 1 and 2 because they were forgiven beforehand.

I think it is clear they are violating the Fair Debt Collections Act by misrepresenting both the nature and amount of loan I owe.

2024-02-28,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","On XX/XX/2024, the amount of {$8200.00} was accidentally submitted through our joint XXXX  XXXX XXXX account to the government loan merchant Nelnet. The amount should have been {$82.00} paid monthly towards a Federal student loan with a remaining balance of under {$900.00} The {$8200.00} was debited from our checking account on XX/XX/XXXX sending our account into overdraft. 
We noticed the error immediately and called XXXX  XXXX XXXX customer service to request a stop payment on the {$8200.00}. They assured us that the amount would be stopped, and our account credited the next day. 
On XX/XX/2024, the {$8200.00} was refunded. Three days later, on XX/XX/XXXX, the said amount was re-debited from our account again forcing our account into overdraft. We called the bank who again assured us that the amount would be reimbursed and that Nelnet, the merchant could only attempt the withdrawal twice. We were advised to call Nelnet to make them aware of the situation. Nelnet acknowledged the request and placed a note on file not to process the payment. 
The {$8200.00} was then refunded on XXXX XXXX. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, the {$8200.00} was withdrawn from our account for the third time. After speaking with the Bank, they again assured us that the maximum number of attempts Nelnet was allowed to resubmit the amount for payment was three times, not to worry about it Nelnet would not be paid. We called Nelnet again to request that they not submit the payment. They agreed and confirmed that there was a note on file indicating that we had requested that they not submit the payment and assured us that it would not be resubmitted. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, the {$8200.00} still hadnt been credited back to our bank account. Once again, we reached out to the bank who advised us that it could take up to XXXX hrs from XX/XX/XXXX for the amount to re-appear in our account. 
On the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, we again called XXXX  XXXX XXXX, and this time were told that the transaction had in fact been processed allowing the payment to go through to Nelnet, even after multiple requests to both the bank and Nelnet to stop payment, and repeatedly being assured that the money would not be taken out. We then followed up with a visit to one of the Banks branches, who informed us that the transaction had definitely not been completed and that Nelnet had not been paid. We were told to wait until XX/XX/XXXX for the funds to be re-deposited. This did not happen. 
Our salaries were deposited into our account automatically on XX/XX/XXXX which went towards offsetting the {$8200.00}, and still leaving our account in debit. We followed up with a call once again to XXXX  XXXX XXXX who said that there was nothing they could do. It was beyond their control and that we should guess what? Call Nelnet! In fact the rep informed us that WE now owned them money even though we had no money to put into the account because they had allowed it to go into debit because Nelnet had the received payment regardless of the number of times we called both institutions to request a stop payment. 
So, again reached out to Nelnet for a status and were told that they could not find the original transaction of {$8200.00} in their system and were only seeing a transaction for {$82.00}. We did a three-way call with the Bank and Nelnet. The Bank provided Nelnet with reference information and confirmation that the payment definitely had gone through. Nelnet said that they would put through a refund but that it was now in the hands of the Treasury Department who could take up to 20 days just to review the case, and secondly it could take up to 7 weeks for them to issue a check. A week later, we called Nelnet for an update, and they advised us that it was out of their hands and could not provide a status. They then went on to tell us that we should call Studentloans.gov providing us with their tel. number. The first person who answered was very rude, and simply said she could find the loan information. Eventually, we were transferred to another person who said that Studentloans.gov didnt handle billing and that we should be contacting Nelnet . We told them that we had done this several times and the person made the comment Nelnet keeps telling people to contact us for billing issues which is not correct. We only process the loan applications.

I believe it was in XXXX of last year. I paid the notified payment with a slightly larger payment amount anticipating that the extra would go directly towards the principal. I continued to do this for XXXX months. 

In XXXX, I was checking my account when I realized that the principal was actually increasing rather than decreasing. If I continued to make the this payment I would have never paid the loan off. I contacted NELNET to find out what my payment schedule would be and to have the situation explained. 

I was notified via email from the NELNET Customer Service Team that my payment amount was verified to be correct. I returned the email with a second question : How many payments will I be required to pay off the loan? 

I received another email from a different NELNET Customer Service Team member stating that I would have a XXXX payments at the verified amount. This is where it gets interesting. 

If you multiply the amount of payments by the verified payment, the total paid will be approximately {$20000.00} short of the full loan amount. I brought this to their attention via email and they answered with a telephone number to contact. 

I contacted this number only to have them tell me that I had to contact the NELNET Customer Service Team for a better explanation. I sent them another email and yet to have a response. 

I can't seem to get them to give me a payment schedule. I looked on the website and it says is that it is not ready yet. 

I checked the interest amount stated on the statements I have been receiving. The verified payment only covers about a third of the interest. The statements are also confusing because each states that the verified amount is applied to the loan and the additional amount is stated but doesn't seem to be applied anywhere. Very confusing statement.

When I asked them about applying for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program they advised I didn't qualify for that ( even though I worked for a state agency that does qualify ) and that it would be best to do the forbearance or deferment options. I mentioned I wanted to pay my loans but I just needed to reduce the monthly cost not defer them. They stated I wouldn't qualify for an Income-Driven Plan at that point and to defer the plan. So I went ahead and deferred the plan and then went into forbearance when directed. Finally, I spoke with someone else at Great Lakes ( after doing forbearance and deferment ) and they stated that I would have qualified for Public Service Loan Forgiveness and also for Income-Driven and they set it up, but then it was already a few years too late as all that time in forbearance and deferment should have been on the income-driven plan and public service loan forgiveness plans. This caused a lot of financial hard-ship now as now I have to try to get all those months to count that should have already been counted as I was willing to pay just needed the reduced amount due to my income.","","Nelnet, Inc.","NV","89128","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-17,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8366566,2024

Ive been trying to make extra principal payments to some loans when I can. This happened more than once, when I called to fix it last time, they re-did the same wrong way. Their website is UDAAP and misleading. Most recent example : I have auto debit set up for payment amount XXXX of each month. I followed the websites instructions for extra payments which is On their special instructions page, I selected do not advance the due date, on the payment page, which is how it says you instruct extra payments to go to principal. Their site says use the pay by group page to target specific loans. It says in their website that the auto debit will still occur as scheduled and say so as you submit the payment. So on XX/XX/XXXX, I paid the payment due at the time, then expected ( based on their website ) the auto payment to still occur on XX/XX/XXXX and that the XX/XX/XXXX auto payment would to principal but the auto debit doesnt go thru, which is contrary to what their website says. If I try to make an extra payment now manually through their website, it will apply to the XX/XX/XXXX payment instead of principaltheir payment page doesnt allow you to apply extra toward principal unless you pay double or more of the payment amount. So for example, when I try to pay extra {$50.00}, there is no option to have that apply to principal, it holds it as a partial payment for the next due date. I even called to ask how this last time this happened ( waited 3 hrs on hold ), the representative said I have to select the due not advance due date button- but again that only appears if I submit at least double the payment. The representative said cant see the same screens that borrowers do so she didnt know how and wasnt able to instruct me how to make extra principal payments ( unless it was at least double ). She even called another department and had me on hold and didnt have info on how.

As a result, I called Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX immediately after receiving this letter and was placed on hold for several hours until I finally was able to speak with a customer representative. 

The customer representative informed me that I was denied because I had not submitted supporting documentation with my application on XX/XX/XXXX ( which I was never directed to do so ). She recommended I resubmit my XXXX application verbally over the phone with her ( which I did ) and told me it would take 5-7 business days to complete. 

As part of the application I submitted on XX/XX/XXXX, I also requested to be put into administrative forbearance for one month which is required when switching from XXXX plan to XXXX XXXX.

( These XXXX incorrect loans are listed in addition to the XXXX correct loans now held by XXXX. ) I have filed 3 separate disputes with XXXX to correct the Nelnet loans, starting in XX/XX/XXXX. Each time, XXXX contacted Nelnet, but the information was not corrected. Instead, my credit report now states that these loans are correct as of XX/XX/XXXX, even though the information is a year out of date. Following the 3rd dispute, I contacted XXXX via phone to ask what was needed to remove the Nelnet loans. XXXX told me that they needed a letter from Nelnet stating that these loans had been transferred in XX/XX/XXXX. 

I then called Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX. The person on the phone directed me to email their customer service email to ask for this letter. I sent this email the same day ( XX/XX/XXXX ). However, as of XX/XX/XXXX, I have not gotten any meaningful response. ( I did get one response on XX/XX/XXXX asking for my personal information so that they could locate my account, and another email on XX/XX/XXXX asking me to re-send an attachment, but nothing since then. ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a complaint against Nelnet with the XXXX XXXX XXXX. They responded that it was up to XXXX to report my loans and that their action would be to request that XXXX do this. I replied that the issue was not with XXXX since XXXX had already been correctly reporting my loans for over a year, and I again requested the letter for XXXX. Nelnet 's rebuttal was that they had not provided any information to credit reporting bureaus since XX/XX/XXXX. I provided documentation from XXXX proving this was false. The customer service agent I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX also confirmed on the phone that Nelnet had communicated with XXXX when XXXX investigated my disputes, but that Nelnet had failed to notify XXXX the loans were closed and had only provided the outdated balance and the note that the loans were in """" good standing.

2024-01-16,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Struggling to repay your loan","Problem with your payment plan","On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted an application on studentaid.gov to switch from standard IBR payment plan to the new SAVE plan, along with pay stubs. That same day, I received email confirmation from studentaid.gov that my application request and corresponding income information had been forwarded to my servicer. I had paid off all accumulated interest on my federal loans during the pandemic, so my balance was strictly Principal. I thought this was great, so that I did not have to worry about any capitalization when switching from standard IBR to the SAVE repayment plan. 

I sent an email to Aidvantage a few weeks later to check the status of my request and received an email response stating that I was on the standard IBR plan, so I took this to mean that my request hadn't been completed. On XXXX, Aidvantage stated that they needed income information from me to process my request. The same income information that had been provided via studentaid.gov on XXXX. So I re-submitted the same proof of income. For the rest of XXXX, I continued to receive periodic messages about forbearance ending, Autopay enrollment being approved ( I had been on autopay for years ), and messages stating that my repayment terms had changed, but the payment information and terms remained the same. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I sent another email to confirm that I had been switched to the SAVE plan, because all I was able to see was the payment amount on statements, and not the name of my IDR plan. On XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage once again replied that I was enrolled in the Income Based Repayment plan and that if I wanted to exit IBR, I'd have to call. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received e-correspondence with my request to exit income-based repayment plan, followed by another notification that my autopay amount was changing. The autopay change letter once again showed the same {$210.00} payment that had been calculated under standard IBR. 

From XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, I used valuable work time to call Aidvantage in order to clarify the multitude of notifications I was receiving, having to ask each time whether they had completed my request to switch to the SAVE plan. Phone reps told me that the SAVE plan would push my monthly payment to over XXXX XXXXXXXXmonth, whereas the standard IBR was {$210.00}. I did not understand their math, as IBR is supposed to be 15 % of discretionary income, and SAVE is supposed to be 10 %. Nobody could walk through the math with me or provide documentation showing the work of whomever calculated my payment. 

I received more autopay enrollment confirmations and more change in repayment term messages through XX/XX/XXXX, and each time the monthly payment remained as {$210.00}. 

I continued to call and email Aidvantage throughout this time to ensure my request was being processed accurately without much success. All of the delays concerned me, as interest had begun to accrue again, and I was diligently trying to avoid capitalization when switching repayment plans. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an update on my request stating that I did not qualify for an income-driven repayment plan, followed my another message that was supposed to contain options that may help. Following the links in that message simply took me to an option to exit income-based repayment on the Aidvantage website. 

I made yet another phone call between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with a different representative. I summarized the events going back to XXXX and asked for her help to switch to SAVE. I will say that she seemed to have a slightly better understanding of the terms of the SAVE plan than previous representatives, who I assume didn't know specifics of various plans and were simply using a generic calculator provided by Aidvantage. This final rep walked me through various plans and tried to convince me that a Graduated repayment plan would be best, as it would give me a lower payment. I thanked her for that, but insisted that I preferred the other benefits of the SAVE plan, especially since the monthly payment should drop from 10 % to 5 % of discretionary income later this year, not to mention the benefits of interest not accumulating and capitalizing when the income-based payment isn't enough to keep up with interest accrual. She was very kind and said she wasn't aware of the switch to 5 %. 

The representative walked through the numbers utilizing the most recent AGI that I was able to provide. She also informed me that if tax returns are not provided to calculate IDR payments, Aidvantage uses gross income from pay stubs. How many people are paying hundreds of dollars extra each month because Discretionary Income can't be determined from pay stubs? Also, I still fail to understand how my standard IBR ( 15 % discretionary pay ) was {$210.00}, but my newly calculated SAVE plan ( 10 % discretionary pay ) is {$380.00} per the XX/XX/XXXX correspondence received. I would appreciate seeing that math broken down. All student loan statements should be required to provide the name of the IDR payment in which the borrower is enrolled. Each monthly statement should also display monthly payment amounts under all other IDR plans utilizing the income information provided by the borrower, and there should be an additional page that shows the income information as well as full descriptions of each IDR plan.

None of the forms I filled out, and none of the questions asked during phone calls requested my AGI. They only asked for gross pay, and what is my household size. Then they would ask how many dependents I had. I thought that by saying I had a household size of XXXX made it pretty clear that I had no dependents, but now I just worry if people with no dependents are charged more in whatever calculations Aidvantage uses to determine monthly payments. 

So I've spent more than XXXX months trying to switch to the SAVE plan. I've submitted online forms, sent emails, and made several phone calls to ensure that my request was accurately processed. In that time, my federal student loans have accumulated more nearly {$900.00} in interest that will very likely be capitalized once the switch is complete.

How many millions of borrowers don't fully understand all the terms of their IDR plan and/or are unable to continue pestering their loan servicer to the extent that I have? How much money are servicers stealing from borrowers by improper management of loans? Also, what about borrowers that tried to switch to SAVE but were talked out of it by ( hopefully ) well-meaning reps that were just doing their jobs using the calculators that they were provided? What if those borrowers were put in other plans with lower monthly payments, and won't receive additional benefits of SAVE, such as the XXXX administration 's plan to erase debts for certain borrowers that initially borrowed less than {$21000.00}? They will miss out on that forgiveness, as there is a deadline for them to switch to SAVE. Forgiveness notifications are supposed to begin in XXXX. Aidvantage has been telling me throughout all of this that they may need at least XXXX  days to process my request. It has taken over XXXX  months! How in the world does any part of this broken system make sense?","","Maximus Education, LLC dba Aidvantage","MI","49085","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-16,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8161206,2024

2024-01-10,"Student loan","Private student loan","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","In XX/XX/XXXX, I refinanced my student loans with PenFed Credit Union to a 5 year, adjustable rate loan. I very quickly paid down a large portion of the loan and was a number of months ahead on payments ( PenFed allows customers to skip payments if they are ahead on repayment rather than taking the extra payments off the principal amount ). My monthly statements never actually showed how many months ahead I was, until a change in format with the XX/XX/XXXX statement, which showed my next payment was not due until XX/XX/XXXX. This continued until XX/XX/XXXX, when the statements again changed, now showing my next payment was due that month. I believe what PenFed did was recast or reamortize my loan, effectively negating the months ahead I was on payments and requiring me to make monthly payments again, albeit at a lower amount, all without notifying me. 

I have made inquiries about this issue since XX/XX/XXXX. I was finally told in early XXXX that there was indeed an issue with their system in """" forecasting due dates after rate adjustments for variable rate loans. '' My 'next payment ' date was corrected and I was ensured that a detailed explanation would be given to me once the issue had been investigated. In late XXXX, I asked for that explanation and was told that additional information could not be given beyond the detail that a problem was identified and a solution given. I believe PenFed Credit Union has changed their policy/practices regarding the management of adjustable rate loans without notifying its customers, and is now actively preventing me from obtaining information to which, as a customer in good standing, I feel I am entitled.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","PENTAGON FEDERAL CREDIT UNION","WA","986XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-10,"Closed with non-monetary relief","Yes","N/A",8137652,2024

2024-01-18,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I have been paying {$520.00} towards my 7 XXXX student loans, serviced by MOHELA, through their auto-debit service since XX/XX/XXXX. 

My owed payment each month is {$220.00}. 

My XXXX payment was applied to all 7 of my loans ' interest and principal as expected, but the XXXX and XXXX payments were only applied to the XXXX unsubsidized loans ( notated as loans 5, 6, & 7 on my account ). This allowed interest to accrue on the other 4 loans unpaid. 

On Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX I noticed this issue and contacted MOHELA at XXXXXXXX EST. 

The service representative confirmed that what I saw was occurring incorrectly, and after 50 minutes of investigation by her supervisor could only say that the payments were applied incorrectly and that it would not happen again going forward. 

I asked to speak to the supervisor who did the investigation as the explanation that they simply weren't applied correctly was unacceptable, as I have been paying more than double the payment amount and no loans or interest should be going unpaid. 

When 'transferred to the supervisor ' I encountered an automated message that no supervisors were available. 

I have had multiple loan servicers since I entered repayment in XXXX and have been paying more than my payment amount for years so I am 'ahead ' of the payment schedule. Despite this, each servicer before MOHELA has correctly applied my payments to owed loan interest first, owed principle payments second, and then applied the excess to loan principle. Previous servicers have even had a helpful form when setting up auto-debit for the borrower to choose how to apply that excess, for instance, to the higher-interest loans. MOHELA does not. 

When student loan repayment restarted with MOHELA in XXXX, I spoke with MOHELA on the phone to ensure that auto-debit payments would be handled in the same manner as my previous servicers and was assured that they would. 

This 'error ' on their part has allowed more than {$170.00} of unpaid interest to accrue on the 4 loans that have not been paid into since XXXX. 

Despite their assurances this will not happen again going forward and admittance that this was an error on their part, nothing was explained or offered to resolve this issue. Asking to speak with a supervisor simply sent me into an automated system and survey. 

This is a gross and unacceptable payment handling error on their part that has financial ramifications for me and likely many other borrowers affected by the same errors.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","GA","303XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-19,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8181028,2024

2024-01-04,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","Tonight, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX., I received an email from Mohela alerting me that I was past due on my student loan payment ( attached ). This is the first time I was notified that I even had a payment due let alone that I was now past due. 

I logged into my Mohela account to make sure I did not miss anything. I looked at the loan information for both loans, and they both said I was past due and that my next payment is expected on XX/XX/XXXX, in the amount of {$260.00} ( {$130.00} for the current payment and {$130.00} past due ). I went to my messages in the website and saw a letter from Mohela telling me I was past due. The letter was dated XX/XX/XXXX. Mohela waited over 24 hours to even send me the email to let me know my account was passed due. What kind of business practice is that? 

Mohela never notified me of my SAVE application being approved ( applied in XX/XX/XXXX ), nor did they notify me that I would be taken off the administrative forbearance they put me on to process my SAVE application in XXXX ( CFPB complaint filed ), nor did they notify me of payment due on XX/XX/XXXX. In fact, on Mohela 's website, it states they are required to notify me 21 days before my bill is due. This never happened. 

As you can see by the documents I attached, Mohela hasn't sent me any letters or emails about a payment being due. The notification for payment due should have been around XX/XX/XXXX, and in my messages for my account, there is nothing. I logged in just before the end of the year to see if there was any update on a payment date or information. There was nothing, confirming to me that Mohela did not update my account. 

Mohela has violated my consumer rights by failing to notify me of payment due and then emailing me at XXXXXXXX XXXX ( after business hours ) to let me know I am now LATE, after placing me on a forbearance without even telling me why. Plus, I can't call anyone at this business because wait times are four hours each time only to get an agent who can't answer any basic questions. Mohela can not legally report it late to the credit bureaus due to the Dept of Ed 's on-ramp policy for the COVID pause so if I see a notification that this occurred, I will be back to file one again. 

This is an unacceptable practice especially if they are supposed to be the """" experts '' in servicing of federal student loans. The company can not even complete the correct tasks of bill notification or responding to complaints with the right information. Mohela should be held accountable and heavily fined for their inability to do their job correctly and efficiently. The sad part is my tax money is being sent to pay this company. They have exposed how predatory and corrupt the entire student loan system is. Mohela is nothing but a for-profit entity gobbling up free tax money and providing lousy services to the citizens.

On XX/XX/2024, the account was reflected as current. Despite the account being reflected as current, I received a call from a PHEAA representative asking me to pay what was past due. At this same time, the associated checking account had a cleared charge for {$610.00} that was processed a day prior. This is what caused me to call in to PHEAA to ask why I was still receiving phone calls despite a payment being fully made a day prior. This is when I got PHEAA XXXX XXXX on the phone. The details of that conversation are in a separate complaint, because that complaint in and of itself should be separate based on the behavior of the employee. 

It's bad enough that PHEAA can not document their system properly to prevent calls from going out once a borrower makes payments. This adds another layer of distrust to the ongoing trust issues created by this XXXX. But for an employee to act in such a way that would annoy anybody just because a borrower calls in to voice their concerns makes the entire situation even more burdensome. 

As a side note, the representative who submitted the complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, was a representative who kept me on hold for a long period of time because I told her I did not wish for her to submit a complaint because I had submitted a complaint on her a few days prior. Both employees had a non-friendly demeanor and it would appear they were attempting to get me to hang up by being sarcastic or keeping me waiting. All this behavior, and these employees get paid. I feel sorry for the next group of people who have to deal with either of these employees.","","AES/PHEAA","PA","XXXXX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-02,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8461304,2024

I call in to confirm I am enrolled on Auto-Pay, and am informed that despite signing up for Autopay I needed to make the next two payments manually. I double confirmed that despite saying Autopay Started in XXXX, I would need to make my next two payments from that date manually and the agent double confirmed. This was not stated anywhere in the online process for Auto Pay enrollment and is super misleading. 

I was then told because I was """" late payment '' I would need to reenroll in autopay, so despite all the details showing correctly in the XXXX for AutoPay I needed to restart it and then once again manually pay for the Auto Pay for 2 months. No where in the online process was this stated.

This was during a big switch of loan servicing systems, and it never showed up on my account. I called about it in early XXXX XXXX  and was told by a representative that the payment was received and that it should show up on my account soon. When it didn't, I called again in the next month or two and they said that they saw that it was received and that it should show up on my account within 5 business days. When it still didn't show, I called again and they said that they would put it on emergency status and that it should show up on my account in the next 5-10 business days. I called on Monday XX/XX/XXXX, and the call mysteriously dropped right when I started to explain my situation. I called back immediately and requested a call-back but never received one. 

I called again on Friday XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX said that she didn't see the payment but that there was a request for proof of payment ( which nobody had ever told me about ). I sent that proof of payment then called the same day to see if it went through. I was told by XXXX that she saw the uploaded document but that it would take up to 41 days for it to be processed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called for an update and was told by XXXX that it would take 12 business days for the finance department to scan the uploaded document. Then on XXXX XXXX I received a call from EdFinancial which I was unable to answer. I was also sent an email that was not personalized to my situation but that sounded like they wanted more information. I contacted XXXX to get a check-trace and uploaded a PDF of the check trace from XXXX to EdFinancial on XX/XX/XXXX. I allowed the previous XXXX business days for the finance department to scan it before following up. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and talked with XXXX. She said that she got in contact with someone who asked when I sent in both the receipt ( proof of payment ) and the check trace. At the end of the call it was determined that they had received proof of payment. I allowed time for it to process and called back on XXXX XXXX  where I spoke with XXXX. She told me that research was submitted on XXXX XXXX, but there were no other updates. 

Nothing has been resolved in over 8 months of following up on this payment. I currently have the money to pay this loan off the moment this is resolved, but I am being forced to hold back on making that payment until the {$1600.00} shows up on my account. If I make the remaining payment now, It will result in me missing a payment deadline which will negatively affect my credit score. Because of this delay on EdFinancials part, I am being charged interest which I wouldnt have been charged if this was taken care of on one of the several times they told me it should be taken care of.","","EdFinancial Services","UT","846XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-12,"Untimely response","No","N/A",8152141,2024

During the pandemic when everyone was deferred from paying on their student loans I called into Mohela, and was able to talk with a representative. The reason for my call was trying to understand their qualifying payments for my student loan forgiveness program. According to my plan, if I made XXXX qualifying payments my loan should be forgiven according to them. My question was could I make more payments than just XXXX within a XXXX  and would those still be considered qualifying payments. I was told that it didn't matter just as long as I made payment they would be counted. I found this too good to be true so, I called another day to confirm this and I spoke to another rep and they provided me with the same information. Mind you I had to wait on hold for at least XXXX hours just to speak to someone if not longer. They said it didn't matter as long as we could verify my employment as a non-profit and I made the XXXX qualifying payments they would be counted. 

During the timeframe of XX/XX/23 - XX/XX/23 - I made several payments XXXX XXXX XXXX and when I say several I mean I made a single payment for the qualifying amount almost every day during some months  to get myself up to the qualifying payments. I already had several payments but I wanted to pay off my student loans and be done with them forever. 

Long story, short when everything started to come back from the pandemic and repayments were no longer going to be deferred I was contacted via email to be informed that they were only going to count my payments per month. So, they now are saying via email that XXXX payment in the qualifying amount per month, which meant all the extra payments I made during the months, well those didn't count or matter. They would only accept XXXX payment per month. 

I wouldn't have an issue with this if I was told upfront that's how it works but I was told by XXXX Mohela representative this wasn't the cause. I've tried to call in countless times to get this straightened out but no one answers. I can only email them and when I do they are not understanding or just send me copy and paste messages. No one is taking the time to actually read or go over my message or even look into my issue. 

I'm sick because I've spent XXXX XXXX XXXX dollars that will not get counted, because they are only accepting XXXX payment per month. I can download a record of all the payments I've made to them as proof. During XXXX XXXX XXXX  I've paid over, XXXX payments totaling {$3700.00} + I'm happy to provide any documentation that's needed. Bank statements, anything.

This is one of a series of communications submitted to these agencies since XX/XX/XXXX in an effort to gain relief from this longstanding dilemma, a situation that has resulted in extreme financial and emotional difficulty for me and my family for more than 30 years. Anything you can do to help bring this matter to an end would be greatly appreciated. 
____________________________________________________________________ TO : United States Department of Education - Office of Loan Forgiveness & MOHELA ____________________________________________________________________ LOAN FORGIVENESS REQUEST - UPDATES XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted an application for an IDR consolidation for the SAVE Program, because of information I received stating that I would have to apply for the SAVE Program in order to be considered for LOAN FORGIVENESS in XXXX. I qualify for full loan forgiveness for the following mandatory reasons plus other related reasons as outlined below : Standard Qualifications for Loan Forgiveness : I have applied for the SAVE Program via an IDR Consolidation application. 
My original loan was less than {$12000.00} ( {$9400.00} ), which originated in XXXX while in XXXX  school. 
I have made more than 20 years of payments. 

Other Justifications for Loan Forgiveness : As previously noted, I first received student loans while in XXXX school totaling {$1700.00} from XXXX to XXXX. These loans were paid in full on XX/XX/XXXX. 
In XXXX and XXXX while in XXXX  school I received loans totaling {$9400.00}. I paid on these loans over the next twelve years. In XXXX the payoff was around {$9000.00} but I was having difficulty making the payments and became delinquent. The account had been referred to a collector in California ( XXXX XXXX ). They were calling me at home and at work non-stop. Then in XX/XX/XXXX the collector recommended that I apply for a consolidation loan through XXXX in order to bring the balance current and stop the collection calls. I did so effective XX/XX/XXXX. Keep in mind that the only loans I had were the XXXX loans totaling {$9400.00} with a payoff of around {$9000.00} - after 12 years of payments. After this consolidation loan was executed, I received notice that my total balance had shot up to well over {$30000.00} overnight, even though I had no other loans and had never returned to school after XXXX. I questioned this development through XXXX  over and over again but never received an explanation except that I had allegedly received additional loans, resulting in the quadrupling of my payoff. Finally, in XXXX XXXX agreed to refer my case to the U.S. Department of Education for review. I was then contacted by XXXX XXXX of the USDOE who spent several weeks conducting an exhaustive investigation of my loan and payment history. I was interviewed extensively during this process. At the conclusion of her investigation, she reported to DIRECT that there had been extensive duplication of charges in my case, something I already knew. But I had been unsuccessful at advocating on my own behalf. I was extremely thankful and appreciative to the U.S Department of Education and certain that this matter would finally come to a close. To my shock, however, XXXX refused to accept the findings of the U.S. Department of Education and continued to demand payment. As a result, I continued to make payments until the pandemic pause in XXXX - or another 17 years - a total of 29 years since the loans originated. It has now been 34 years since these loans originated and the payoff is currently reported by MOHELA as {$24000.00}, again after 34 years and payments of more than XXXX Therefore, I am asking that this balance of {$24000.00} be forgiven immediately, especially since these loans have already been paid. This, actually, would be a correction rather than a forgiveness. 
Per MOHELA, I am also being charged for two loans taken out by my adult daughter in XXXX and XXXX with a current total balance due of {$14000.00}. MOHELA and a past servicer alledge that I co-signed for these loans, though I did not. A number of years ago the servicer sent me a copy of a co-signer signature sheet with my name on it, but it was not my signature. Again, I never co-signed for these loans. I have tried to pay on these loans because my daughter was unable to make payments and because she suffers from XXXX  XXXX, preventing her from driving and limiting her ability to earn a regular income. Now that I am retired, I am no longer able to pay on these loans. Also, I have no legal responsibility to pay on these loans. Therefore, I am asking that these loans be forgiven immediately. 
MOHELA has also notified me that a loan with a current payoff of {$6300.00} taken out on XX/XX/XXXX was for my son while he attended XXXX XXXX. However, my son was XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX and did not enroll at XXXX XXXX until XXXX. This is clearly an error on the part of MOHELA and further underscores a longstanding issue with my student loan history. 
One loan to XXXX XXXX was paid off in XXXX. Another loan to XXXX XXXX is currently being paid at {$250.00} per month and is current. These payments continued to be made monthly throughout the pandemic pause. 
There are two parent loans taken out for my son in XXXX and XXXX while he was a student at XXXX XXXX where he graduated in XXXX. Payments on these loans were set to begin in XX/XX/XXXX after the pandemic pause. 
I was a XXXX XXXX employee from XXXX to XXXX ( when I worked for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX )- for 14 years. Now that I am retired, I have also XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX 
The urgency of my request to have loans forgiven/ corrected is underscored by my age and health condition, severely limiting my ability to earn additional income. I am XXXX  years of age and have several serious health concerns. 

I have taken all steps to qualify for loan forgiveness under current federal USDOE loan forgiveness programs and to demonstrate my eligibility. 

Your attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

XX/XX/XXXX : Received congratulations notice from Mohela that PSLF had been granted. I was required to log into the system to see what was awarded. Upon logging into the system, I found that my account was set to {$0.00} balance. There was also a new message with a letter attached, dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I had satisfied my obligation for my account and no additional payments were required for the following loans : XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX {$21000.00} {$0.00} XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX {$25000.00} {$0.00} XX/XX/XXXX : I logged into the Federal Student Aid website and found that the balance had been updated to {$0.00}. This confirmed my loans were forgiven. I checked every so often just to be sure and every time I checked Mohela and Federal Student Aid websites, the balance said {$0.00}. 

XXXX : There was NO COMMUNICATION from Mohela. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Received messages from Mohela 's website/email stating I was required to start making payments again for my account. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I called Mohela and spoke with XXXX. I told her that my loans were forgiven in XX/XX/XXXX but that I was getting messages that I owed for my student loans. XXXX said there was an error and that my loans were mistakenly forgiven. I told her this could not be true and that I had notice from Mohela that all of my debt had been forgiven. Additionally, never once had Mohela sent me notice that my loans were discharged in error. She and her supervisor researched and after 25 minutes, told me that I was right and that my loans were forgiven and mistakenly put back into payment status. XXXX stated her supervisor was going to put my loans back in process to be discharged, which could take five days. 

XX/XX/XXXX : AFTER getting off the phone with XXXX, I received two notices from Mohela stating that my loans were improperly forgiven and that I had only made 13 qualifying payments for PSLF. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Called Mohela back because my loans were still showing due. XXXX came to the phone, gave me the """" collecting a debt '' speech, informed me my account was three days late and asked me if I was calling to make a payment. I said no and advised XXXX of the situation. XXXX researched and advised that my loans had been improperly discharged due to e-filing around a certain date. I told her I had a letter from XX/XX/XXXX proving Mohela had forgiven my debt. She said it was wrongly forgiven, but not discovered until after and that I received notice. I had to explain to XXXX that the """" notice '' she is referring to was only sent by Mohela after I called them about it. I asked for a supervisor and was never transferred to one.

This is not how to treat consumers. First of all, before loans are forgiven and letters generated a quality control/assurance check should be completed.

Additionally, if indeed Mohela made an error and should not have discharged my loans, they should have recognized that a forgiveness letter was sent XX/XX/XXXX. That should be honored. 

Mohela has sent multiple notifications to me, all with conflicting information while they were investigating my PSLF application, not all which were listed here. However, once I received notice that my balance was forgiven and it showed {$0.00} on the websites, I felt safe. That is, until XXXX of this year when they reinstated my balance WITH NO NOTIFICATION.

My loan was consolidated in XXXX of XXXX from XXXX XXXX to XXXX  and in XX/XX/XXXX I request a refund for the voluntary payments I made during the covid period. I have called many times to check on the status of the refund as I had not received anything or any confirmation. Finally in XXXX, I received a check for {$2800.00}. I again called Mohela because according to my records, that amount was very low compared to the actual payments I made. That total should be {$8500.00}. After speaking with several supervisors who tried to figure out what was happening, a review was conducted on my behalf and I got another check in XXXX for {$580.00}. I called Mohela XX/XX/XXXX and I spoke to XXXX today who confirmed that based on the records that Mohela has, the total payment that is showing up on your end is {$3400.00}. After telling her that I had proof of several payments totaling {$8500.00} that were made from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, she asked that I dispute the records by providing proof of the payments I made. 

Between XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I made the following payments which total {$8500.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX {$1500.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$960.00} XXXX {$910.00} XXXX {$1000.00} XXXX {$1100.00} XXXX {$1000.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$1000.00} ( {$600.00} + {$400.00} ) XX/XX/XXXX {$1000.00} I tried to upload the documents via Mohela.com customer advocacy team tab but that tab no longer exists on the website so she gave me this email to send all my documents. Attached you will see my Payment History document printed directly from XXXX website on XX/XX/XXXX. The payments in reference are on pages 7 and 8 of that document. I have also attached my bank statements ( with the payments highlighted on pages 4 or 5 ) that show the same amounts and corresponding dates that those payments were made. I would appreciate a review of these documents so that I can receive the remaining {$5100.00} owed me. 

CURRENT DAY UPDATE Since that time which is now a year ago, i have emailed several times for an update and i get the same generic response to my email- They have received the correspondence and will need time to research the account and will get back to me. 
Several request for information have been put in on my behalf ( assuming they actually do it because i am told verbally that they will and i don't have any proof of it ) and nothing has come of it. 
I have also called several times- I have spoken to many supervisors who promise to look into it and reach back out to me with an update and never do. Sometimes the agent tells me that the supervisors wait time is too long and to input my phone number and ill get a phone call within 48 hours. This has happened many times and i have not received one call. Other times, i wait on hold for hours or some agents just hang up on me. It is very very frustrating as i am also working towards a PSLF forgiveness and getting answers for my question is like pulling teeth. Till today, i have not received any answers concerning my request and it is now almost 2 years later. The same documentations i have attached and sent several times will be attached to this complaint. I hope theres a solution soon and i can be sent my refund.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","IL","60441","","Consent provided","Web",2024-04-15,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8779199,2024

I have called numerous times to check on the status of my pending IDR plan. 

I applied for the XXXX repayment plan in XX/XX/XXXX. MOHELA/Student Aid has been processing my application since XX/XX/XXXX, and it is still """" processing '' as of today, XX/XX/XXXX. Since XX/XX/XXXX, MOHELA has placed me on the wrong repayment plan. MOHELA has placed me on the Level plan, but previous to my re-application in XX/XX/XXXX I have always been on an IDR ( income-driven ) repayment plan in order to count my eligible employment toward the PSLF program. I spoke to customer service representatives at MOHELA back in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, who verbally verified the correct payment under the XXXX plan that would be applied to my account once payments restart, yet I never received written communication about this. For the last 2 months, MOHELA has disabled the message button on my account, so I am unable to directly send messages in order to have written communication on file. When I asked a MOHELA customer service representative for written verification of my conversations, they said no. 

Since then, I have reached out to MOHELA again to fix this issue and to place me on the correct IDR plan. They have me due for a payment today, XX/XX/XXXX, on the Level plan which is incorrect and will NOT count toward PSLF payments, as well as the payment amount being incorrect and much higher than what I would pay on my typical IDR plan. I have reached out 3 separate times during the month of XXXX alone to have this issue resolved and still no change to my account. As of XX/XX/XXXX, MOHELA has placed only half of my loans in Administrative Forbearance, with a XXXX plan payment still being reflected on my account. When I last spoke with a representative at MOHELA previous to XX/XX/XXXX, they misinformed me. I was explicitly told that my full account would be placed into forbearance until I was on the right repayment plan, since I have taken all necessary steps on my end to apply to an IDR plan to have my payments reflected for PSLF. As of today, there is no change on my MOHELA account. For the record, I have a 100 % on-time payment history for my loans and now due to MOHELA 's processing errors, misinformation, and lack of proper guidance, I may have a past-due payment reflected on my account and a full month of eligible employment not counting toward my PSLF. How is that fair, when I have taken all the correct steps necessary on my end to make sure I am on an IDR plan for my PSLF payment counts? 

I need further assistance with this matter as my calls to MOHELA have not remedied my requests and have created significant stress on my end over the last couple of months.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","IN","463XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-19,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8176029,2024

But NOW I received my bill for XXXX and I have a past due amount for {$14.00}!? How!?! All my bills have been either administrative forbearance or paid in full. Now Im worried they are again going to mess up my credit score or my counts for PSLF because they just keep messing up billing and payments.

2024-04-07,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Problem with customer service","I am requesting assistance in resolving ongoing issues with the servicing of my student loans. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I proactively consolidated my loans to take advantage of the limited Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) waiver. However, due to a misunderstanding, it wasn't until XX/XX/XXXX that I was directed to submit the """" Direct Consolidation Loan Request to Add Loans '' form ( XXXX No. XXXX ) to include XXXX additional loans in my consolidation request. After several communications, I received confirmation that my request had been forwarded to XXXX XXXX as directed by the Department of Education. Subsequently, on XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed that my request would be processed. Although there were unforeseen challenges, including delays in processing and errors in loan forgiveness and it did take a significant amount of energy and time, I believed these had been resolved and the loans were consolidated. However, several outstanding issues remain. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I observed my account reflecting a {$0.00} balance and my account included a note indicating that my loans were discharged as of XXXX of last year ( XX/XX/XXXX ). However, shortly after inquiring about this alert, the balance was reinstated without explanation, and all payment counts and PSLF details were removed from my account. I received several unclear communications from Mohela, including a message indicating that my loan was ~~unconverted~~ implying a sale or transfer of my loan, without further details. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received communication from MOHELA stating that my payment counts have been recalculated. While this is a positive step forward, upon review, I noted that some payments and IDR credits for forbearance are missing from my account between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. By my count, there should be qualifying payments for 68 months and qualifying waivers for an additional 34 months. These payments were made to XXXX XXXX, and I possess bank statements as evidence for several of these years. 
I have attached the student aid data file downloaded from studentaid.gov, which outlines the payments and waivers I believe should be credited to my account. 

While I am very grateful for the steps taken this far, I still have concerns given that my question to MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX has not been responded to and the new recounts are incorrect. Since I should be well past the XXXX mark for forgiveness and given the length of time it has taken to correct these issues through no fault of my own, I am requesting immediate escalation of my case to a senior resolution team for a comprehensive review. 

I am attaching a copy of my most recent message I sent to MOHELA today, as well as the supporting documentation I provided. I would appreciate it if my account could be placed in administrative forbearance until these matters are fully resolved. This would provide peace of mind and allow us to focus on finding a solution without the added stress of impending payments. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your positive response and a collaborative effort to reach a satisfactory resolution. Should you require any additional information, I can be reached at XXXX or by email at XXXX.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","TX","78154","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2024-04-07,"Closed with non-monetary relief","Yes","N/A",8716377,2024

Mohela is stating that I am required to recertify my income for my income-driven repayment plan before XX/XX/XXXX. Per the XXXX administration rules, no one should have to recertify before XX/XX/XXXX. 

Mohela has ignored multiple previous requests from me and they are currently """" reviewing '' my income-driven repayment plan recertification date. I expect them to find that they have done nothing wrong and not push my date back by 1 year. This has happened to multiple others in the same situation, hence me reaching out to CFPB today. 

Per FSA/StudentAid, my IDR anniversary date is XX/XX/XXXX, so XXXX renewal would put me at XX/XX/XXXX, which is before XX/XX/XXXX. My date should be no sooner than XX/XX/XXXX and Mohela is not moving it. 

My date on Mohela for IDR renewal was initially listed as XX/XX/XXXX, then changed to XX/XX/XXXX. Mohela is not being transparent with borrowers when they change dates last minute without any notice, nor are they responding in a timely manner leaving borrowers wondering what next month 's payment will be.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","MI","494XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-18,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8370766,2024

Starting XX/XX/XXXX I requested my loans convert from 10 year level pay to 25 year level pay as I just was purchasing a house that ended up having more problems than anticipated. These higher costs have become a burden. Mohela changed all but one of my loans from 10 year level to 25 year level pay. The loan they refused to change even after reviewing my four repeated requests is the largest, at approximately {$20000.00}, with the highest interest rate of them all. Thus, the most profitable. The change from 10 year to 25 year would save me {$100.00} a month ; it would make a big difference in my family and my own situation. I submitted requests for the 25 year level term pay on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. They placed me on administrative forbearance that has ended and I have had to make payments since XXXX that are over {$100.00} more than I should have to make. They reviewed and dismiss my XX/XX/XXXX request as duplicate, I believe in XXXX, and marked my first two requests as approved but I continue to pay a third higher monthly payment as they have repeatedly refused to properly service my loan with this repayment schedule change. Frankly, as this is the highest interest rate, largest, and highest payment loan by a wide margin it does appear to be purposeful. This is echoed by many other 's online feedback and discussions of repeated failures always to the detriment of borrowers and demonstrating a pattern of abusive loan servicing practices. I have also submitted a complaint regarding this at studentaid.gov today, XX/XX/XXXX, as no remedy is in sight and the additional financial pressure builds on my family each month.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","NJ","088XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-18,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8365670,2024

I submitted complaints and contacted FSA, FSA ombudsman, EdFinancial and XXXX  to correct all information on my FSA accounts since XX/XX/XXXX.

The only issue is with my account information being corrected on the Federal Student Aid website and they continually give me the run around and do not correct my account information.

2024-03-06,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction and frustration with the lack of assistance and the prolonged delay in processing my income-driven repayment plan. As a borrower who has diligently adhered to the necessary steps and provided all required documentation, the lack of progress in this matter is unacceptable. 

Despite submitting my application for an income-driven repayment plan well within the stipulated time frame and fulfilling all necessary requirements, there has been a glaring absence of any proactive assistance or updates from your end. It has been [ insert duration ] since I submitted my application, and I have yet to receive any confirmation or indication of progress. 

The purpose of income-driven repayment plans is to provide borrowers with a manageable and equitable method of repaying their student loans based on their financial circumstances. However, the current situation has left me feeling overwhelmed and unsupported. The burden of uncertainty regarding my repayment options is exacerbating my financial stress and negatively impacting my ability to plan for the future. 

Furthermore, the lack of communication and assistance from your customer service representatives has only served to compound my frustration. Despite repeated attempts to seek clarification and guidance, I have been met with vague responses and empty assurances, which have done little to alleviate my concerns. 

I urge you to prioritize the processing of my income-driven repayment plan without further delay and provide me with a clear timeline for resolution. Additionally, I expect to be kept informed of any progress or updates regarding my application. 

Furthermore, I request that you implement measures to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your customer service channels to ensure that borrowers like myself receive the support and assistance we deserve. 

Failure to address this matter promptly and satisfactorily will leave me with no choice but to escalate my complaint to higher authorities and explore alternative options for resolving this issue. 

I trust that you will take immediate action to rectify this situation and provide me with the assistance and support I require.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","IL","60618","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-06,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8483878,2024

2024-04-08,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","Mohela has mishandled my PSLF for over a year. They have denied my PSLF because of lack of qualifying payments even though I have more than double the amount of qualifying payments needed. Mohela makes it very difficult to get through the phone system in order to reach someone to resolve the complaint. You go through phone systems that bring you to an endless loop and also put you on hold for extended periods of time. When you speak to a representative, they are not able to answer your questions. For example, I requested an accounting of qualifying payments so I can better understand what payments were and were not counted towards my forgiveness but the representative was unable to help me. I requested to speak to supervisor, but they will no longer allow you to speak to one. They put you on a long hold and then you get to an automated system that doesn't work correctly - I sent a message to mohela about this and they responded that I would get a call back but never did. A company needs to provide a path for escalation. They also mishandled my forbearance paperwork. I technically should have only been on forbearance for a month. They put me on forbearance after I was put on the SAVE program even though I do not have a current payment. If I have XXXX payment, no forbearance is needed. I have spent countless hours trying reach Mohela and countless hours on the phone trying to get my loans forgiven, but Mohela continues to give me the runaround without any avenue for resolution. The qualifying payment count Mohela has is incorrect but they do no provide an avenue for correction. I am not sure how Mohela does not provide an avenue to correct errors. They continue to delay my PSLF, because they stand to make money not discharging my loans given that I had to move my loans to Mohela in order to qualify for the PSLF exception. This has been going on since XX/XX/XXXX. Mohela mentioned to me the only way for me to get my payments counted is through the FSA IDR process which they told me would be complete by end of XXXX and then I had to wait until then. I waited until the end of XXXX and then reached out to Mohela and they further delayed it again and stated that I had to wait until XXXX of XXXX for the IDR process to complete. I don't even know why they even stated this, because I believe that this information is incorrect as I believe the IDR process has probably been completed by now. Mohela is continually trying to delay my forgiveness and in the mean time, repayments have technically restarted. It seems that Mohela doesn't want to take responsibility for correcting any errors and wants to point the finger at FSA and say it's out of their hands. There is a lot more that I could complain about over the past year working with Mohela, but at this point I would just like Mohela to correctly count all my payments. I have also sent a secure messages in which Mohela did not respond within the time period stated they would respond. Also their response was the following : Our records indicate that you have already called and spoken to one of our Customer Service Representatives regarding this inquiry. We will assume the inquiry has been handled. 

I am not sure why they would assume that my inquiry was resolved. The whole point was that customer service is unable to resolve my issue. My next message stated that I was unable to reach a supervisor and also that it took several hours of being looped and transferred and three phone calls in one day to try to put in a request for a supervisor to call me back and their response was that someone would call me, but no one ever did. So their response to secure messaging is sincerely lacking. No service at all and nothing gets resolved.

I have uploaded to Mohela 's document upload system for PSLF 2 documents. 1 is Mohelas denial of PSLF for lack of qualifying payments. the second document is from my loan servicer showing I have over 230 out of the 120 qualifying payments needed for forgiveness. I have also sent a secure message requesting that mohela review these documents.

This immediately caused concern because I have had auto-debit set up since my loans were first transferred from XXXX XXXX to MOHELA. The auto-debit payments had gone through as scheduled for the previous months so I was shocked to get this notice. I tried messaging MOHELA through their website and was given generic responses saying that it takes 1-2 months for auto-debit to take effect but this should not have been the case because it had been set up several months before and had been working smoothly prior to XXXX. MOHELA sent another notice that my XXXX payment was past due on XX/XX/XXXX. I messaged MOHELA again asking them to correct the payment issue as it was their auto-debit system that skipped the payment and they gave me the same generic response. On XX/XX/XXXX I tried calling MOHELA to talk to a representative but was sent in circles with automated messages. One of the messages said that my student loan payments were in repayment pause and payments would resume in XX/XX/XXXX. If this was the case, they should have never marked my XXXX payment as past due. After this call I submitted a formal complaint to studentaid.gov and messaged MOHELA again stating my experience and notifying them that I submitted a formal complaint. Ever since my loans transferred to MOHELA it has been difficult to manage their website and it is nearly impossible to get any clear answers about my loans.

2024-02-05,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","I was in the PSLF program, in fact, I am due quite a large refund and am patiently waiting. This however has to do with the timing and mishandling of my PSLF in collaboration with the consolidation of my fed and FEEL loans and the one-time payment count adjustment. Information provided was not followed through with and I believe did not follow protocol and timelines outlined which resulted in part of my loans not being forgiven. Whether it was purposeful or unintentional, it should be rectified and looked into further because it is affecting others, as well.

When applying for PSLF, borrowers were told NOT to consolidate our FEEL loans if we had made a significant number of qualifying payment, because it would restart the number of payments made back to XXXX. Because I knew I had already overpaid, I did not consolidate. Then, in XXXX XXXX XXXX I saw that there would be a one- time payment count adjustment in XXXX and it would apply to all loans IF they were consolidated ( and it included the FEEL loans this time. ) I called Mohela to be sure I understood this correctly and they assured me it was safe to consolidate and that all of my loans would then be forgiven after the one- time payment adjustment in XXXX. I immediately applied to consolidate my loans, this was on XX/XX/XXXX. The consolidation was granted on XX/XX/XXXX and I received a letter that said they would disburse the funds in XXXX days, unless I changed my mind and contacted them during this time, ( that disbursement would be on XX/XX/XXXX. ) I was notified on XX/XX/XXXX that my PSLF loans had been forgiven. Which now meant that my consolidation would not combine my Fed loans and my FEEL loans, because there were only FEEL left to consolidate.

I called Mohela, because I couldn't believe the timing of this was so hurtful and moved so quickly when I was told it takes at LEAST XXXX months and an application for consolidation could extend this timeline further, ( and let 's be honest, we all know things are taking WAY longer than they say because they are overwhelmed right now. ) The representative was shocked as well, because everything was pushed through in XXXX  months. They wondered if my calling to ask about the consolidation expedited things, because they haven't seen things move that quickly before. ( They are actually the one that suggested I contact you ) Also, I had been told by Mohela representatives and literature online always said that a borrower would be contacted before finalization and have the option to withdraw from the PSLF program if they chose not to accept the forgiveness. ( I always wondered why anyone would do that, but in this case, if I had been notified before it occurred, I could have held it off until after the consolidation and XXXX payment count adjustment took effect, as was recommended to me by the representative ) I called the same day I received the email about the forgiveness ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to try and hold it off, but they said it was already done and there was nothing they could do about it. 

I also called and spoke with XXXX, they said there is nothing they can do either. 

Over the course of the past couple of months I have called and spoken with several different representatives and supervisors at Mohela to see if they can't at least apply the XXXX payment count that was approved for my fed loans onto my FEEL loans, since that was the spirit of the XXXX payment count adjustment, and because they should have contacted me prior to the finalization of the forgiveness, but they say their hands are tied and they can't. At least XXXX of the representatives say they have seen this happen to others, as well, and have directed me to file this complaint. I have to believe that there is an ulterior motive for pushing the forgiveness through before the consolidation and not contacting me before finalization or the representatives would not be referring me to file a complaint.

If this is a completely honest comedy of errors, than I believe it should minimally draw attention to ( and correction of ) the fact that many borrowers did not consolidate earlier, because we were told it would be detrimental, then the rules changed to help borrowers/parents who were paying on FEEL loans AND their own loans and allow them to consolidate the XXXX without losing the years of payments they had already made, and in fact it was intended to help streamline the process and apply the maximum number of payments made on ANY loan to ALL loans. There should be a way to apply the payment count to my FEEL loans, especially when they know I was consolidating AND considering they did not contact me prior to finalizing the forgiveness as was stated on the website at the time and reiterated to me from the representatives. I was assured ( because I specifically asked ) that IF the forgiveness paperwork went through before the consolidation I would still have the option to opt out and reapply after the consolidation and XXXX payment count adjustment. 

The representatives were sure with the backlog of applications and time it was taking to process the PSLF paperwork that I should not withdraw my application because it could further complicate the process and that, if need be, there was the safety net in place for me to opt-out of the forgiveness before it was issued if my consolidation had not taken affect. Of course, in fact, the safety net was not employed and the forgiveness was moved ahead in half the time they said it would MINIMALLY take ( and in fact I was told the consolidation process would likely delay the PSLF process ). This leaves me with a loan that is not forgiven even though it should have been because I followed all directions and recommendations given to me by Mohela. 

Every representative I talked with also commented on how I had the highest payment count they had seen, so I wonder if Mohela did not want all of those payments to count toward my FEEL loans and ultimately forgiven whereas applying counts to others who would still have years of payments ahead of them was less of a big deal? I have no idea what, or if, they stand to lose anything financially through this forgiveness process, but it does seem strange that protocols and timelines did not seem to apply in this case and that a process that should have taken a minimum of XXXX months took effect just XXXX business days after discussing the situation with a representative. 

Because I was in constant contact to be sure I followed all of the directions, did everything I was supposed to do when I was supposed to do it, these loans should have been included in my forgiveness. The timing of communication with XXXX, lack of communication with me, and the apparent expedition of my forgiveness before the consolidation and one-time payment count adjustment could occur are reasons I believe their practices should be investigated and my case reviewed for a fair resolution.

Due to the timing of when borrowers, particularly parents could consolidate the FEEL loans and when the one-time payment count adjustment would occur, I am sure you will be able to see how this could negatively impact others, as well. Even if Mohela stands to gain nothing from pushing the PSLF through before the consolidation and one-time payment count adjustment period could apply, it's actions should not hurt the borrowers who the program was meant to help. ( A program, by the way I was not made aware of, even though I hold FEEL loans. I accidentally happened across it while on the website applying for unemployment forbearance. Another discretion I feel should be investigated. Why are borrowers not receiving mass emails when new programs and rule changes take effect? )","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","WI","547XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-05,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8286261,2024

I am enrolled in the public service loan forgiveness program ( PSLF ). Every month I am employed and make a monthly payment on my student loans, I continue to make progress toward loan forgiveness. In XXXX Mohela placed my account in administrative forbearance without my knowledge or consent, thereby disqualifying my XX/XX/XXXX payment from counting towards my PSLF payment counts. I contacted them to remove the forbearance from my account and they ignored me. I recently requested to be switched to another payment plan, and again without my knowledge or consent, they placed my payments on hold, which again will disqualify and pause my PSLF payment, prolonging the amount of time I need to be enrolled in the program and making payments before my loans are forgiven.

2024-02-16,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","MOHELA is a corrupt loan servicer that is using """" mistakes '' in its payment processing system to scam people out of additional payments that they do not owe. Contacting MOHELA to rectify these issues takes hours out of one 's work day, which is not feasible for many working people. I hope that this complaint will help get justice for those who are unable to address this issue themselves. 

My student loans were transferred from another servicer to MOHELA during the pandemic loan forbearance period. The first time I ever had to make a payment to MOHELA was in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Leading up to XX/XX/XXXX, I received multiple email notifications telling me to create an account on their platform and set up auto-debit so they could withdraw payments directly from my bank. I did so prior to the deadline. However, when the time of the first payment came around, I suddenly received an urgent email that """" due to an error '' in the way the auto-debit was set up, auto-debit would not start working until XXXX and I needed to log in and set up another payment for the first month. My payment was already in default by the time I got the email ( through no fault of my own! ) and I was able to pay within a few days of the original due date ( on XX/XX/XXXX ). 

The auto-debit appeared to work correctly after that, and I made my next payments without an issue on XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. 

In late XX/XX/XXXX ( over the holidays ) I received a notice that MOHELA was transferring its services to a new web platform and that I would need to set up yet another new account before my XXXX payment. I was sick and tired of dealing with them, so I decided to pay off my loan in its entirety. On XX/XX/XXXX, I logged in, requested a loan payoff estimate, and scheduled a final payment. 

The very next day, I received a notice from MOHELA that they had mistakenly billed me for my loan in Fall XXXX when I was actually still in forbearance. The notice said that if I had paid them, I should request a refund. I called an waited on hold for nearly an hour, and finally spoke with a customer service rep who promised to refund my XXXX and XXXX payments, and to cancel the XXXX payment which was still being processed. I told him that I had just scheduled a payoff of my loan and asked if the fall payments would have affected the payoff estimate that I'd received the day before. He told me no - all was well with my loan payoff. 

Both the refund and the loan payoff showed up in my bank statement in XXXX, so I assumed I was finally done with the nightmare of MOHELA. But yesterday ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I received a notice that my loan payment had been processed. What loan payment?! I logged in today and saw that my old monthly payment amount had been auto-debited from my bank. My MOHELA account page shows an amount due that is equal to my monthly payment, which does not make any sense. I called XXXX TIMES to try and get this resolved and after waiting on hold for XXXX mins each time, was forced to hang up to get back to work.

XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX took my call and stated that I am owed a refund of {$19000.00} due to the one-time IDR adjustment that discharged my student loans in XXXX. XXXX.

She contacted the accounting department and told me to allow them approximately XXXX  days to determine where my refund is. 

XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX took my call regarding missing payments on my PLSF tracker. She did not have any information about the PSLF tracker, but she did offer to try and track down my refund of {$19000.00}.

She then stated that MOHELA would contact me in XXXX week with an update. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX took my call and confirmed my refund amount of {$19000.00}. She offered to transfer me to a senior MOHELA rep.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX took my call and confirmed my refund amount of {$19000.00}. She stated that a refund request of XXXX XXXX XXXX was still processing in accounting and offered to transfer me to a senior MOHELA rep. After again waiting on hold for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, once again my call was disconnected from MOHELAs end. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX took my call and noted that my account was open, and then expressed confusion as to the {$19000.00}. She said that was my loan amount that I was paying on, and when I said, no, this was the refund due me from the one-time IDR adjustment waiver, she offered to transfer me to a senior MOHELA rep , to which I agreed. When I confirmed my cell number, the call was disconnected, once again from MOHELA 's end.

At this point, I think I have waited long enough. My loans were discharged in XXXX XXXX XXXX  and I should have received this refund many months ago. I can not seem to get answer from anyone. So I am submitting this formal complaint to every entity I can think of to get some assistance.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","KY","42503","","Consent provided","Web",2024-04-11,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8753959,2024
2024-04-11,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Struggling to repay your loan","Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","I am writing to forward my request to MOHELA to adjust my eligible payments for the Public Loan Forgiveness based on the 3 reasons below. 

As background, on XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a written message to MOHELA about my concerns below. I then had several follow up calls to inform MOHELA about the incorrect PSLF and payment count, and even offered to walk them through line by line about how they should correct their errors. After a few calls, on XX/XX/XXXX, a MOHELA representative finally told me that my XXXX remaining concerns could not be resolved. 

Despite not addressing my concerns, I received the following message from MOHELA : """" Thank you for contacting MOHELA. Thank you for contacting MOHELA. Our records indicate, that you spoke with a representative on XX/XX/XXXX, regarding this matter. However, we want to make sure that all of your questions and concerns have been addressed. If you have any additional questions or concerns, you may contact a supervisor on our Customer Advocacy Team at the number listed below and we will be happy to assist you. '' Given MOHELA 's insistence on not resolving my issue, and given that MOHELA 's errors will extend the number of payments I will have to make to get PSLF forgiveness this year, I am requesting assistance from CFPB to resolve these issues. 

Here are the XXXX concerns : XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX Administrative Forbearance : I am requesting that XX/XX/XXXX count as an eligible month for my PSLF count because my former loan provider placed me on administrative forbearance. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was placed on administrative forbearance while I switched payments plans. I did not request to be on forbearance, but rather was placed on it because my old loan provider was unable to process my change of payment plan request without placing me on administrative forbearance. I also understand that the XXXX XXXXXXXX adjustment of eligible payments was supposed to included months where a borrower was placed on administrative forbearance such as this situation. My request thus fits squarely with what the XXXX XXXXXXXX one time adjustment was meant to do. 

XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX Administrative Forbearance : MOHELA placed me on administrative forbearance during these months because, as was publicly announce, they did not send me a billing statement on time and did not calculate my monthly payment accurately. Yet, MOHELA has refused to credit these 3 months as qualified payment months for PSLF, when they clearly should count. 

XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX Payments During COVID-19 Uncertainty : My employer made XXXX payments of my loans in XX/XX/XXXX as summarized below : XXXX : {$3400.00} XXXX : {$1300.00} XXXX : {$3400.00} Total : {$8300.00} Those payments were made, with my permission, at a time when there was tremendous uncertainty with when payments will restart. Now that payments are going to restart for me on XX/XX/XXXX ( I am paid off until then because of a lump sum payment ), I am requesting that these XX/XX/XXXX payments of {$8300.00} be applied to my XX/XX/XXXX remaining bill of {$490.00}, and then for every consecutive month after starting with my XX/XX/XXXX payment. If done correctly, the payments should cover my remaining XXXX payments before forgiveness, which is until when my XXXX  month payment of {$1200.00} expires. Please note that a refund of these payments is not an option because my employer, a federal government agency, will not receive the refund even though I tried. Thus, my solution is the only equitable one given the uncertainty with the COVID-19 payment pause and payments just restarting for me on XX/XX/XXXX.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","CA","91791","","Consent provided","Web",2024-04-11,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8751791,2024

Mohela informed borrowers at the time that payments due during this time would count towards public service loan forgiveness. 

My XXXX and XXXX payments have shown up as """" eligible '' payments for loan forgiveness. My XXXX payment is showing up as """" ineligible '' for loan forgiveness. 

XXXX is my XXXX ( or last ) payment to be made for loan forgiveness. The fact that Mohela is showing my XXXX payment as ineligible is hindering my qualification for loan forgiveness. I submitted my XXXX paperwork with them on XX/XX/XXXX to update my payment counts and to reflect that I have met my end of the deal. I have worked for 10 years in public service. I have done my work. 

Mohela is passing the blame to the department of education and says that it is not on them to change the payment to """" eligible. '' They say they can not expedite the process. They say that the process will be done by XX/XX/XXXX, but they can not tell me when I might be processed in that timeline. It could be tomorrow, it could be XX/XX/XXXX. This rationale makes literally no sense considering that XXXX and XXXX are marked as eligible. 

What they are telling me is that it takes them up to 60 business days to certify a form for loan forgiveness and that I can now resubmit my form for qualification. They do not acknowledge that this will affect the money the money that I should be refunded because XXXX will qualify for loan forgiveness. 

So ultimately they give me these choices. Bearing in mind that I have qualified for loan forgiveness at this point, I have worked for 10 years in public service. I can : A. Wait on them to process the form I submitted on XX/XX/XXXX and reject it as saying I have 119 payments. Even though XXXX qualifies and they acknowledge XXXX qualifies. 
B. I can resubmit my form now, having made a payment for XXXX and XXXX. Restarting my timeline for loan forgiveness while continuing to pay them ( since they won't pause payments until either you wait over an hour to speak to them or they process the form ). 
C. I can cross my fingers and hope that they decide my XXXX payment is eligible before they process my payment certification ( ECF ) form. 

None of these are fair to me. I have done my end of this bargain. XXXX qualified and my payments should reflect it as qualified. To make me continue to pay for my loans is absurd, to make me jump through these hoops is also absurd.

2024-03-09,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","The following is an email I sent to MOHELA CEO XXXX XXXX after MOHELA has repeatedly failed to correctly process my Public Service Loan Forgiveness certification forms. 

My name is XXXX XXXX. I have student loans and I am enrolled in the PSLF program. My MOHELA account number is XXXX. Copies of this email are being sent to Senators XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX of Michigan, as well as the Michigan Attorney General XXXX XXXX. I have also sent similar correspondence to Rep. XXXX XXXX, as well as the author of the XXXX article about PSLF and MOHELA dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

To begin : until my loan servicer changed from XXXX XXXX to MOHELA, I never had an issue having my PSLF progress count updated. 
Now, for the second year in a row, I have had a horrendous time dealing with MOHELA and I can verify that MOHELA is deeply incompetent and is running circles around at least one borrower, me, in the PSLF program. I know there are many others, as affirmed by the XXXX article published XX/XX/XXXX. 

For starters, MOHELA has now for two years running failed to properly process my PSLF certification forms. In XXXX, after hours of phone calls over the course of several weeks, my PSLF payment count was finally updated after MOHELA initially failed to do so upon processing my PSLF form. However, most recently I submitted a certification form in XXXX of XXXX, which should have taken my progress count to XXXX payments by my calculation, but due to MOHELA 's incompetence, MOHELA marked that form as a duplicate and failed to update my payment count. 
The form was not a duplicate, and the only explanation I received was that I happened to submit my XXXX form on approximately the same calendar date as my XXXX form. Sheer incompetence. 

My PSLF progress counter has now sat at XXXX payments of XXXX now for over a year ( meaning if my latest PSLF form was correctly processed I would be eligible for forgiveness ), and I continue to be employed by the nonprofit at which I have worked for the last XXXX years. Prior to that I worked at another qualifying non profit for approximately XXXX years. All of this can be verified in my previous PSLF certifications and is accessible on my borrower profile on MOHELA 's website. 
Regarding the form I submitted in XX/XX/XXXX, a customer service representative verbally confirmed to me that it was MOHELA 's error that the form was marked duplicate, and then, after they spoke with their supervisor, I was told they would not correct the error and would not adjust my payment count. That is completely unacceptable, and there ought to be notes in my record with MOHELA verifying these interactions. 

And so, I submitted a second form at the end of XXXX, XXXX. 
Several days later, I see that the form is marked as """" Processed '' and yet I see no update to my progress counter which, as I mentioned, should take me to at least XXXX qualifying payments, and make me eligible for forgiveness. I have only worked XXXX jobs in the 11 years since I entered the program, both of which have been at qualifying non-profits, and I have diligently re-certified each year. I ought to be about as straightforward of a case for PSLF as there is. As I said, I never had an issue until MOHELA became the loan servicer. 

As I write this, I am sitting on hold with MOHELA after calling the phone number MOHELA specifically lists for PSLF assistance. A representative answers the phone after XXXX minutes, and after I explain that I'd like to know when my payment count will be updated based on my latest form being marked """" Processed '', the representative tells me they'll have to transfer me to a PSLF specialist. And now I am back on hold. Keep in mind that I called the number MOHELA specifically lists on the Contact page for PSLF assistance. This would indicate to me that MOHELA is absolutely scheming to avoid handling PSLF calls, just like the XXXX article asserts. 

I can't imagine I am the only borrower sitting at XXXX payment periods but finding that MOHELA is giving them the run-around and failing to correctly process their PSLF certification. 

MOHELA must do its job and expeditiously update my payment count, and, finding as they surely will that I have reached or surpassed XXXX qualifying payments, and in coordination with the Dept. of Education, grant me forgiveness in completion of the PSLF program.

I was victim to this and appreciative of the temporary expansion ( TEPSLF ). I have correctly submitted all of my paperwork to have the previously unqualifying payments count towards my XXXX payments towards full forgiveness to MOHELA. This paperwork was submitted ( with an attachment ) in XXXX of 2022. Because I had gone in and out of full time employment at my qualifying employer, an attached document was provided detailing all of the dates that I worked to be considered full time and therefore work towards my forgiveness. In XXXX of 2022 the paperwork was under review. Several months later it has said processed but my payments were still not reflected. I called and they said even though the document says processed it can still take another 90 days for the payments to reflect ( untrue ). I have since called and spent more than an hour at each juncture explaining, escalating my complaint ( including bringing it to the federal government ) to each time be told that it will be handled. Most recently I had someone say they would have it reviewed again in detail and understood my problem. Today I got an email saying they are missing documentation about average hours worked. In the document submitted under average hours worked it says : see attached document which in full details the months of a full 4 years at the qualifying institution and which of those months were considered full time. They are now asking for this information-which they have, and continuing to not solve this XXXX year issue, to which they have every amount of information needed.

2024-01-27,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","On XX/XX/23 I completed an application on the Federal Student Aid website to change to the SAVE plan. I was told my monthly would be {$800.00}. The application was transmitted to MOHELA, and they confirmed receipt XX/XX/23. 
I never received a correspondence about the status or processing of my SAVE application. I called twice as the repayment restart was approaching, the first in early XXXX, and, I believe, the second in either late XXXX or early XXXX. I don't know the exact dates of those calls, but it was in that range. 
In the first call, the MOHELA representative told me that the application was erroneously marked as a duplicate and not processed. She marked it for reprocessing at that time and said I would receive a correspondence within a couple of weeks. I asked if forbearance would count towards PSLF and she said a very clear NO ( we later, obviously, learned that the admin forbearance was supposed to count towards PSLF ).

In the second call, I asked again about the status of my SAVE application. The representative said that it was still in progress. She also confirmed that admin forbearance would NOT count towards my desperately needed PSLF. We discussed how to manually enter my payments and she processed the request to remove me from forbearance. The representative instructed that payments made while the request to return to payments was processing would be backdated and thus count towards PSLF. 
I made payments of nearly {$1000.00} each in XXXX and XXXX. In XXXX, my account reflected no payments due and that the month would count towards PSLF. 
In XXXX, I received two correspondences from MOHELA dated in XXXX about the admin forbearance. Later this month, I received a notification that my IBR request had been processed and my payments would be {$990.00} per month. This is not at all what my XXXXAVE application from FSA said, and I still haven't heard any specific updates about my SAVE application despite repeated requests, both in phone calls and messages through their system. 
Not only have they lied, but they are refusing to honor the lower SAVE monthly payment approved through FSA.They 've ignored repeated requests for updates, and lied about the PSLF counts for XXXX and XXXX while in admin forbearance, causing me to lose approximately {$2000.00} I did not have to pay. Now, they're continuing to charge me over {$150.00} more per month than decided by FSA. I'm not clear if they just junked my SAVE application and put me in the regular IBR, or if they decided that their own calculations were better than the ones used by FSA.

All of this is on top of countless other issues with MOHELA, from their complete ineptitude at assuming control of all of these federal student loans from other processors, to properly counting PSLF totals and granting forgiveness, to completely bungling to the restart of repayments and the SAVE program. The number of problems with this company far surpasses the standard for negligence, and they should be held to account by the government. How much are we paying this company for their understaffed, ill-trained, and flagrantly incompetent loan servicing? Why on earth should they receive another cent from loan borrowers or on the federal contract when their behavior is this egregious? 
I qualified for $ XXXX on the SAVE plan on XX/XX/23. I demand that MOHELA honor this, refund the nearly {$2000.00} XXXX spent because they lied and tricked us into making unnecessary payments, refund an additional {$180.00} for the XXXX payment that they charged under the wrong plan, and immediately set my repayments to {$800.00} for XXXX and on. I also don't want to see any nonsense about recertification for the next year as they have absolutely screwed me at every turn on this, and I will not have them demanding recertification early to try to make up any of the money they should lose on this.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","VA","22401","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-27,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8236801,2024

The service loan provider MOHELA are not able to process payments on-time. Rather they decline on-time payments and only accept late payments. I have tried to make payments and they simply decline them and push me to delinquent. I believe this is a scam they are using to tell the media all student loan borrowers are delinquent. I have the money, I use the same information with both attempts to pay but only the past-due one goes through. 

They are purposefully mismanaging on-time payments so they can make borrower 's appear delinquent. Their payment denial says my financial institution does not exist. This is contrary to them taking the payment on the second attempt. They notify of the issue after the loan is due and then only accept the late payment. I believe this is on purpose and meant to ruin the credit of borrowers like me. I feel powerless because I can not even get in contact with them, they just say they are super busy. 

This service provider took on loans they could not handle. I have never in my life not been able to pay a loan I owe. These companies are refusing or unable to process payments. This is causing me to appear delinquent. I am a XXXX XXXX, I can afford my payment and I make them one time. These providers are scamming honest people trying to repay their loans. 

There is also NO way to contact the providers. An email tasks 3-6 months for a response and they are no longer taking them. The call center gives 45-1 hour wait times but never answers. They also will not call back. 

I am not delinquent in the eyes of the federal government, but it is the service providers. 

Please contact these agencies, as they are not honest about their ability to take on servicing loans.

I called on XX/XX/XXXX because my forbearance period was going to end XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with XXXX who told me my SAVE application was pending and the forbearance would be extended. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX because my account was still showing forbearance ending in XXXX. I spoke with XXXX who transferred me to XXXX. I was told again my application was pending and that there had been some error and my account should be in forbearance. I was told they would fix the mistake and put my account into forbearance through XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX the forbearance was still it showing up and my account said a payment for over {$2500.00} was due on XXXX. My account still said I was on the Level plan. When I called that day I was told by XXXX my SAVE application was still pending but there hadn't been a request for forbearance submitted but she would submit one. Today, XXXX, my SAVE application still had not been processed and my account is still showing me on the XXXX plan with a payment of over {$2500.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX. I called today to try and find out what was going on with my account and to try and make sure that my account was not going to become delinquent. When I called I spoke with XXXX who told me that my SAVE application was still pending, and that there had been a note in their records that I could have forbearance through XX/XX/XXXX, but a forbearance request still had not been submitted. When I expressed concern that I had a payment due on XX/XX/XXXX for a plan that I had not agreed to, and that would not count for public service loan forgiveness, I was told that it was OK to not pay that amount even though my account would become delinquent. She said it wasn't a problem because MOHELA is not reporting past due payments to the credit bureau right now. Whether there would be late fees was unclear. When I asked why, my account had not been placed into forbearance I was not given a reason, and was told that I needed to speak with a supervisor. When I asked to speak with a supervisor I was informed that there was not a supervisor available today, all day, and that the soonest they could get me in touch with a supervisor was Monday. When I asked why there were no supervisors available, I was not given an answer. I called back again and spoke with XXXX, I asked her why I was unable to speak to a supervisor but she also did not have an answer. She said my call was being transferred to the """" advanced department.

Additionally I have been told multiple times that my application would be processed in 5 to 7 business days but despite it having been submitted in XXXX it still has not been processed. Finally, I am also very concerned that my account has not been put into a forbearance which means that the month of XXXX will likely not count toward my public service loan forgiveness because MOHELA has not put my account into forbearance.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","CA","90012","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-03,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8271716,2024

My loans were transferred to MOHELA at that time. I called Federal Student Aid to inquire why my request from XXXX is supposedly in review. A representative informed me that only MOHELA can close the case. Yet, MOHELA told me that it can not access the request. I have since switched from the XXXX repayment plan to the XXXX  repayment plan. Documentation is attached. My XX/XX/XXXX, recertification does not need to be in review. Rather, this matter needs to be closed as it has long since been resolved.

Given that I was told that the payment count on my loans likely would not occur until XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX, I applied to consolidate the two loans. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice ( Review completed email ) that the payment review was completed. Based on the review, I had made 120 payments on one loan and needed to make 13 additional payments on the second loan which I was initially told did not qualify for forgiveness because of the re-payment plan ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). 
I immediately called MOHELA to find out how the consolidation would affect the count and if I could I stop the consolidation and was told that they could not stop it. The new loan has been placed in a repayment status and I now have 0 qualifying payments. I have reached out to the Ombudsman on Student Aid.gov on three separate occasions and no one has responded as of today. I do not know where else to turn. I am not getting any help from MOHELA and StudentAid.Gov will not respond to my inquiries. I only consolidated the two loans was because MOHELA told me that consolidation would be the only way I could qualify for PSLF which clearly was not the case, as evident by the XXXX XXXX XXXX document. My loan balance has increased due to the unnecessary consolidation.

My loans stayed on that administrative forbearance for 180 days I believe. In XXXX I received a billing statement that my loan payment amount was {$420.00}, which was obviously incorrect since that's not what my repayment plan estimate was and I never received any communication about there being an issue with my repayment plan application. I messaged them about this shortly after but never received any communication about when they would get back to me let alone an actual response to my concerns. I then received another billing statement in XXXX that my current due amount was {$460.00} and my past due amount was {$460.00} for a total of {$920.00}. I messaged them again about this and this time actually received a response. The response said that I was 27 days past due on my account, that the past due amount was {$890.00}, and that I owed {$1700.00} before the end of XXXX. They also said that my account was on the level plan which is not the SAVE plan that I applied for and received no communication about there being issues with my application. In fact they confirm that they received my application and that they were working to disclose all applicable loans as soon as possible, that I don't need to take further action, and that my account would be updated to reflect the SAVE plan as soon as possible. I haven't received another billing statement yet but I suspect that I will for another incorrect amount of money. They essentially admit that they haven't done their job and are still just completely fine with charging me an incorrect amount. How many other people are they scaring into thinking that they have to pay XXXX times what their payment should actually be? Why would they not put it back on administrative forbearance if they can't process the application yet? Unless it's just to trick people into paying an exorbitantly high payment and circumvent the repayment plans. Even if my loans do get put on the SAVE plan are they actually going to adjust what I owe and get rid of the {$1700.00} balance I have or are they going to expect me to pay that? That would be XXXX.

However, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from MOHELA indicating that my student loan interest would be starting up. This prompted me to seek clarification on the matter, as I couldn't comprehend why my loan would be incurring interest while under consideration for Borrower Defense.

I have attended multiple schools that are on the Borrower Defense list, and my application is still pending. Despite my efforts to contact MOHELA to understand the status of my Borrower Defense application and the rationale behind the accruing interest, I have been unable to obtain the necessary information.

Moreover, I believe that some of my loans should have been eligible for forgiveness under the Biden-Harris loan forgiveness program for loans aged 20 years and over. Unfortunately, there has been no information or clarification provided on this matter.

I requested they look at the deferment form I submitted earlier to confirm the program end date, but there was no record of such a form, and eventually told by an agent to resubmit a new form. 
I could not resubmit a new deferment form in time because of my schedule and the nature of my duties, where I leave home early and return late, leaving me little or no time.

The loan was provided by XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and serviced by ECSI. I began making payments on the loan until the onset of the XXXX pandemic, at which point it was placed in an administrative forebearance. Now that federal student loan payments are no longer paused, I reviewed my amount due and found it to be a far larger amount than expected ( over {$1900.00} ). In reviewing my monthly statements, it's become clear that ECSI continued to charge interest on my loan during the XXXX pandemic loan payment pause from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. Under the details provided on studentaid.gov ( https : XXXX ), I believe ECSI has been charging interest in error. 

My goal is to make a timely payment on this loan, but I feel I've been charged interest in error. I've spoken with both XXXX and ECSI multiple times. Both parties indicate that they are not responsible for the loan and therefore they can not make changes to the loan itself, leaving me with no possible options for resolving this issue outside of paying for the interest that I feel is predatory and illegal, given the federal policy around federal loans during the pandemic. I've spent many hours on the phone attempting to reach a supervisor with no success. 

I am in the process of waiting for a supervisor 's call from ECSI. The reference number for this call is XXXX. The woman I spoke to at ECSI is XXXX. 

Further, I've requested from both XXXX and ECSI documentation to show that ECSI attempted to notify me that interest would be charged during this time in lieu of the federal pause. They have not been able to provide this information.","","HEARTLAND PAYMENT SYSTEMS INC","CA","90802","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-03,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8098016,2024

However, there was an instance where they missed withdrawing a payment. They've also claimed not to have received a payment on XX/XX/XXXX, despite my confirmation that the payment was made. This has me concerned about other potential errors in their management. I'm worried about the impact on my credit score due to their failure to honor the agreed-upon terms between myself and the financial institution, constituting a breach of our legally binding agreement. In addition to not taking out the funds they also never followed through on the agreement to send me the required documentation as mentioned in the text. I have attached the text to this complaint. 

Today, on XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted them regarding the missed payment. Initially, they stated they weren't aware of the reason, then mentioned it bounced back from the bank. When I requested documentation to verify this claim, they couldn't provide it, which seems suspicious. I had sufficient funds in the bank at the time, leading me to believe they didn't process the payment and are now seeking both the delayed payment and a late fee.","","Navient Solutions, LLC.","PA","186XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-03,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8099756,2024

I got concerned because I was asked if I had the call on the speaker phone and if anyone was in the room with me.

2024-01-29,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","I received an invoice from ECSI dated, XX/XX/XXXX ( see attachment ) outlining I owe a total payment of {$350.00} with a past due amount of {$310.00}. The invoice did not have identifiable information such as what school this amount is owed to as I have a total of 3 separate loans with ECSI, 2 of which are with XXXX XXXX and the other XXXX XXXX XXXX which is supposed to be reassigned to the Federal Government. Moreover, upon checking my accounts listed with this loan servicer, there is not any documentation matching this invoice. 

Suffice to say, this is very upsetting due to the fact, I reached out to ECSI in XXXX of XXXX regarding listed past due amounts when clearly all of my loans did not have any past due amounts. This has been an ongoing problem with ECSI regarding my loans as I have had to file now a total of 3 complaints about this company attaching late fees that are not merited to my account. I have always done my diligence in keeping my loans in current status. Additionally, ECSI assured me via phone call, E-mail correspondence, and mailed letter, after responding to a complaint that I listed with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that all of my loans were in a good forbearance status. 

The loan identified by account code : XXXX which when I checked this morning is in approval status as of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX However, upon further review of loan, XXXX ( XXXX ) it is stating as XX/XX/XXXX that my loan was declined because of additional documents were not received in 40 days which is simply NOT true as I sent in and received approval for both loans which are for XXXX XXXX  XXXX Please answer the following regarding XXXX ( XXXX ) : Why is there a different account number shown in the invoice dated/generated XX/XX/XXXX? 
The account number for the loan which is ( XXXX ) on the generated invoice if the loan in question is with XXXX XXXX  as the account number that corresponds with both XXXX and XXXX- ( XXXX ) is XXXX How could the invoice date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) precede the update on the account as the account was updated on XX/XX/XXXX reflecting the forbearance was declined? 
Why is the update stating the forbearance was declined listed behind the approval status which makes upon first glance to appear that the account is in good standing only to read below and find a decision dated XX/XX/XXXX that the forbearance request on the loan was denied? This is an example of outright DECEPTION! 
What caused the forbearance to be declined when I sent the appropriate forbearance forms that corresponded with the request for XXXX ( XXXX ) ( see attachment )? Moreover, ECSI responded back that the forbearance was approved? See the approved document that clearly states the forbearance references XXXX ( XXXX ). 
I have attached a letter from ECSI dated XX/XX/XXXX that ECSI had received my paper work with XXXX XXXX  and that my forbearance request had been approved from XXXX and that a late fee of {$12.00} was going to be removed from my account. 
Also, the amount does not add up to what I owe to XXXX XXXX  if this is the loan in question. 
The amount corresponds with what is owed to XXXX XXXX XXXX. If this is correct, why are you billing me for money that is not reflected in the account as the account is stating that the loan has been assigned to the government if this is true, why did I not receive official notification on government letterhead that the account is in their hands? Moreover, if the account were assigned to ECSI ; accordingly, why did I not receive official notification that the account is to remain with ECSI? 
The account ( XXXX ) is showing that nothing is due as I have attached what I printed from ECSIs website regarding my account with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Also, the XX/XX/XXXX letter stated that the account was in pending status to be assigned to the Department of Education. However, now the account states that it has been government assigned ( see attachment ). So, why is ECSI billing me for an account that has been government assigned? 

Can someone please correct my account and provide me an update that the concerns that I have listed within the context of this letter have been taken care of?

I called Edfinancial on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with XXXX at Edfinacial. I asked XXXX if my call was recorded. She verified the call was recorded. I explained all of the above to XXXX. XXXX misrepresented PSLF to me. XXXX told me it did not matter if my payment was not paid as """" they do not report to credit agencies ''. I asked XXXX to escalate me to a supervisor or escalation team. XXXX put me on hold. XXXX returned telling me they put me on a """" level '' plan. I explained I qualify for the IDR plan. I have my paper application ready to send. However, I am scared to death to do anything. 
XXXX intimated I did not qualify for XXXX???? I reiterated the above. I informed XXXX my Edfinancial inbox holds the forms I submitted should be there showing I am in the PSLF program. XXXX was not willing to nor informed about PSLF, my account, forbearance etc. She would not connect me with a supervisor. I am accruing interest on a loan Edfinacial should not hold. I never requested Edfinacial. I should be with XXXX. Edfinancial rep XXXX and XXXX placed me on hold multiple times to seek information. I believe both were ill-informed. 
Today I opened a letter saying my payment starts on XX/XX/XXXX. My account online states my payments start XX/XX/XXXX. I am not placed in forbearance. Edfinacial representative I spoke with has not considered my waiver nor communicated in any matter with me- the consumer to ameliorate a loan close to forgiveness- rather create a new XXXX loan to benefit XXXX. I was disconnected or dropped from my next call with XXXX.","","EdFinancial Services","PA","17543","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-07,"Untimely response","No","N/A",8120626,2024

My employer and I electronically signed the Employment Certification Form on XX/XX/XXXX, using the PSLF Help Tool on studentaid.gov. Please see the attached. The Employment Certification Form was sent to MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX. MOHELAs website states that it received the Employment Certification Form on XX/XX/XXXX. Please see the Documents Received attachment. MOHELAs """" PSLF Payment Tracker page states : Processing your PSLF form may take up to 30 calendar days from the date your PSLF Form is received. For PSLF waiver payment counts to be updated or for loan discharge to occur, we must receive the approval from XXXX XXXX XXXX. After we receive the approval, it may take up to 90 business days to process this information. I was not seeking student loan discharge at this time, as I have not reached the required 120 qualifying payments. PSLF waiver counts are not applicable to me, as I always adhered to the original PSLF program rules. Thus, it should have taken MOHELA no longer than 30 calendar days to process the attached form, per its website. Accordingly, MOHELA should have processed my Employment Certification Form no later than XX/XX/XXXX, if its website is to be believed. In fact, the PSLF Help Tool is supposed to expedite processing times. That clearly has not occurred here. It is now XX/XX/XXXX. I would note that my employer has been determined to be eligible on numerous occasions for PSLF purposes per studentaid.gov, my prior loan servicer, XXXX XXXX, and even MOHELA itself. I have a qualifying direct consolidation loan, and I was always on a qualifying income driven repayment plan ( PAYE and now SAVE ). I have always worked for the same qualifying employer that has been approved numerous times. I worked for my qualifying employer full time for 40 hours per week. As of XX/XX/XXXX, which was the last approved Employment Certification Form I submitted, I had made 72 qualifying payments. Please see attached. Since that time, I have made an additional 12 qualifying payments as of XX/XX/XXXX, when my most recent Employment Certification Form was signed ( it is attached ). I should have 84 qualifying payments as of XX/XX/XXXX, which is the date the attached Employer Certification Form was signed through the PSLF Help Tool on studentaid.gov. And yes, my employer and I did everything correctly when using the PSLF Help Tool. My payment due date was the XXXX of each month at the time, so XXXX of XXXX  should qualify. I am on auto debt, so I have never been late with a payment. Processing this form should not be a complicated task.

My loans are held by EdFinancial and I received my approval letter for discharge under the automatic group XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX back in XXXX XXXX. At that point I was super stoked. Then the letters for repayment and that my loan was declined for debt relief started rolling in. Every letter I got I did my do diligence and contacted EdFinancial. I was always told that it would happen """" in phases '' and """" not to worry '' as they could see a note on my account about my borrowers defense. Now mind you I have been on forbearance for a LONG time. This also includes my former servicer XXXX XXXX stopping work with the Dept. of Education and pushing me to EdFinancial. 

So now we come to XXXX this last year and I talked to a lady from EdFinancial because I am STILL getting repayment notices. She states something didn't look quite right. She calls over to another department, speaks with them for a moment and states she is escalating the issue with another department as she was seeing conflicting information. 10 Business days and I should here something via email/snail mail as to the findings of this """" research '' and what they are doing about it. So knowing they are super swamped I decide to give them some extra time thinking, I'm in forbearance so let them get their ducks in a row. That was my first mistake. Since my banking info hasn't changed I was auto drafted my first payment of over {$450.00} while I am out XXXXXXXX XXXX shopping ( where me and my wife do all our XXXX shopping for our XXXX kids ) no less. 

The calls to EdFinancial and Borrowers Defense started at a frenzied pace. I'll save you most of this and just say this. After many calls, escalations, EdFinancial promising to call me back and almost never doing it, requesting a refund for my errant payment, escalating the refund, I am still waiting as """" accounting is swamped and no one can speak to them. '' Was told that even if I had to wait I should receive that money back with my debt discharge at the end of XXXX. Here I am in XXXX with nothing. 

Since I was getting the run around and empty promises from my servicer I decided to put in a case with the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman. The ever hard to talk to or get an answer from. Guess what? My case is still open from the end of XXXX with no response from them either. 

At this point I've stopped calling because it gets me nowhere except XXXX. Can't get a refund of the money they took or relief. 

Here are the facts : 1. Received Approval for Sweet vs Cardona discharge XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX is a part of """" Exhibit C '' making me a part of the """" Automatic Group '' 3. Received a letter from EdFinancial in XX/XX/XXXX and now XX/XX/XXXX stating XXXX. That no loans they held were covered by my borrowers defense claim that was denied XXXX. And they were to credit XXXX amount XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  due to the length of time it took to reach a decision XXXX. BTW they are referencing the """" Trump Era '' where they just sat on these things and didn't work them. 
XXXX. I've called EVERY time I received a letter from EdFinancial between XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX as it never matched my approval. 
XXXX. I was charged over {$450.00} on XX/XX/XXXX due to 1. Old Autopay in system XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX a supervisor from EdFinancial confirmed that I've been in Forbearance again since XX/XX/XXXX and blamed the autopayment on a """" glitch '' where I can off forbearance and back on XXXX. Was declined a refund as """" my borrowers defense case was declined. '' XXXX. Another agent understood what was going on and put in a refund request and a supervisor callback XXXX. I put in a Feedback ticket with the Department of Education Ombudsman office XX/XX/XXXX. 
XXXX. Went through and waited the exact amount of days stated in their literature before contacting them again. 
XXXX. Took several contacts to them to even get the """" confirmation email '' and be able to update my case via the website. 
XXXX. When calling the number for them sometimes you get the Ombudsman office and sometimes you get a regular agent who will always state, """" There is no direct number for the Ombudsman office. '' XXXX. I've never received a response from them yet. 
XXXX. On a supervisor callback with EdFinancial several days later they put the refund in """" Emergency Status '' XXXX. This is where it has stayed. 
XXXX. Due to the """" restart of repayment '' and """" requests for refunds '' no ETA can be given XXXX. Even with my discharge date passed per the Sweet vs Cardona settlement they can not give me any new information XXXX. Back in XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Borrowers Defense at the request of my servicer. 
XXXX. They stated it had been approved XXXX. Information had been sent to my servicer XXXX. Last information on my case was updated on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. They can not do anything and to contact my servicer. 
XXXX. """" Magically '' when I called my servicer back they """" saw the updated information '' which I thought was funny XXXX. I am coming up on my year anniversary of getting my approval which under the """" Decision Group '' rules of the case I should have relief by then but I shouldn't have to wait for that. 
XXXX. I've put in a """" Sweet Automatic Relief Group Deadline Survey '' with the Non-Profit group Project on Predatory Student Lending who is supposed to be overseeing this settlement. 
XXXX. Of course no response or even a confirmation that they received the completed form. Just a blank web page that says, """" Thank you! '' XXXX. Hope it works.

2024-01-27,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","All of my federal student loans are serviced by MOHELA. They were all put on the REPAYE IDR plan back in XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from MOHELA stating, """" Your eligible loans have been placed on the Saving on a Valuable Education ( SAVE ) IDR Repayment Plan. If you were previously on the Revised Pay As You Earn ( REPAYE ) Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan, it has been replaced by the SAVE Plan. '' The letter listed my new monthly payment amount as {$350.00}, and it said the scheduled begin date for XX/XX/XXXX. Given that all of my loans had been on the REPAYE IDR plan, I understood this to mean that all of my loans had been transferred to SAVE. 

However, I did not have a XXXX payment, as my account was placed in an administrative forbearance by MOHELA per federal instruction because they hadn't properly billed me for my earlier XXXX payment. At the end of XXXX, before my upcoming auto-payment, I checked the MOHELA website to make sure everything was set for my payment, and I noticed it said that my payment amount was {$1100.00}. 

I immediately called MOHELA to find out what had happened. Apparently, not all of the loans had properly been transitioned from REPAYE to SAVE, and the loans that hadn't been transitioned and dropped off an IDR plan altogether. I requested MOHELA to immediately fix this and put any loans not on SAVE on SAVE. I also requested an administrative forbearance since this wouldn't be fixed before my upcoming payment due date. The agent said she submitted for this to be done and she also requested the forbearance. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from MOHELA stating that they were """" unable to grant your request '' for an IDR repayment plan because my """" request was incomplete '' and I hadn't submitted the IDR Request Form ( multiple page form ). When I had talked to the agent, she had said this form wasn't necessary because the transition should have been automatic from REPAYE to SAVE and no forms had been needed when MOHELA made that transition. 

I again had to call MOHELA and I explained the situation. The agent said she didn't see why I would have to submit an IDR application as the loans were originally IDR approved and had been dropped off by MOHELA on accident. However, upon talked to her supervisor, I ended up having to work over the phone with her to submit a new IDR request for those loans - despite the fact that this wasn't my fault and should have done automatically by MOHELA in the first place. I am still waiting on that IDR to hopefully go through. 

In addition to the issues with the REPAYE/SAVE transition, I was also improperly billed in advance of my XXXX XXXX payment. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from MOHELA advising that my account was placed into an administrative forbearance through XXXX XXXX ( a little late maybe seeing as it was now XXXX ). The email letter stated that """" the months of XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX will count toward IDR forgiveness and Public Service Loan Forgiveness. '' Yet when I went and checked my PSLF tracker today in MOHELA, the XXXX XXXX loans are all listed as ineligible. 

MOHELA has no business managing anybody 's money let alone student loans for millions. They're completely incompetent and in no other business field would this level of poor service stand.

I have been lied to on every call - the reps tell me that they'll fix everything and that I shouldn't make payments until their fix goes through, and then on the next call I'm told that the previous rep either had lied about the process, had lied about taking action, or both. This has cost me {$8000.00} in accumulated interest. 

On the first call ( XXXX ), I was told my SAVE application was in their backlog. In case the application wasn't processed in time, I was told to disable autopay on my account. 

The second time ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I was told that what I had been told was untrue, the application was lost, and that I should re-do it over the phone. At that point I had been billed for over {$1000.00}. I was told that the application would re-set my this bill, so I shouldn't pay that existing amount. I asked to apply the 1-month administrative forbearance so that the paperwork would have time to process. 

The third time ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I was again told to not worry about the growing past-due balance, as it would take time for it to be reset. There was no record of the administrative forbearance. 

The fourth time ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I was told that none of this was true, but I could apply for a hardship forbearance that would reset my past-due balance, and that an administrative forbearance was not available. I was walked through the process, asked to acknowledge the required disclaimers, and told that the application had been submitted. I was told to expect this to take 7-10 days. I was not told I had accumulated interest that would capitalize. 

By the fifth call ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I had lost all confidence and called to make sure that my forbearance had been submitted. I was told there was no record that it had been entered, much less processed. I was asked to re-submit my application, re-read the required disclaimers, and told it would take 7-10 days. 

My 6th chat was today ( XX/XX/XXXX ), and I was told the XXXX forbearance would take up to 45 days to process. Interest would continue to accumulate ( I am up to {$7700.00} in interest alone ) and would capitalize once the application was approved. I was told I could just go ahead and pay all the past due balances ( now {$2500.00} ) to prevent any further interest accumulation. 

They recommended that I cancel the hardship forbearance and move forward with an administrative forbearance. that would take an additional 35-45 days to process. I could still pay all past-due balances and interest if I wanted to keep any further interest from accumulating. 

Had I been told in XXXX that my application had been lost, I would have re-applied before the deadline. 

Had I been told in XXXX or XXXX that the SAVE application approval would not re-set my balance due, I would have bit the bullet and paid the extra amount. 

Had I been told in XXXX either 1 ) that administrative forbearances were still available, or 2 ) that interest was and would continue to accumulate, or 3 ) that it would take over a month to process, I would have paid. 

Had I been told at any time that following EdFinancial 's advice to not make monthly payments was resulting in over $ 1k of accumulated interest per month, I would have just paid. 

I was lied to repeatedly by EdFinancial representatives, and the result is that I am much deeper in debt than I was when I applied for SAVE.","","EdFinancial Services","UT","84601","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-05,"In progress","Yes","N/A",8111848,2024

2024-01-14,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","To Whom It May Concern, I am writing this letter as explanation that I was billed in error by MOHELA for the month of XXXX in excess of {$490.00}. Attached with this letter to my account, are documents from XXXX XXXX prior to my loan servicer switching to MOHELA as well as a screenshot of the XXXX website. 
Upon reviewing the documentation as well as the laws and regulations during the XXXX student loan pause, my student loans were in a PAYE ( type of XXXX ) plan and were not transferred over to MOHELA as such. Instead as I have recently discovered through phone calls with MOHELA, that I was not placed on an XXXX plan and instead a level plan. 
Per the laws and regulations clearly stated on the XXXX website as well as my XXXX XXXX communications, I did NOT have to renew my XXXX plan during the pandemic pause. I was remaining on the XXXX plan. Legally, MOHELA nor XXXX XXXX has the right to switch me off of my IDR plan and request additional money from me. 
As a matter of fact, when I received communication from MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that some of my loans were still listed as in school status so I called MOHELA over the spring/summer to have this corrected as I did not want to get penalized for having the incorrect information on my account. As a result, MOHELA told me to call my school directly who would make the adjustment on their end and it would flow over. 
I did not receive any other communication from MOHELA until XX/XX/XXXX with a very long list of each of my loans status change and a summary stating that my enrollment status was changed to Graduated on XXXX 
I then received subsequent documentation from MOHELA stating that my total payment would be XXXX starting in XXXX XXXX XXXX 
Then when I logged into the MOHELA website in late XXXX, I found my payment was now listed at {$1500.00} instead of the XXXX I was originally told by MOHELA. At this time I tried calling a total of XXXX times to MOHELA on different days and times between XXXX and XXXX. Due to the lack of staffing and preparedness by MOHELA for the XXXX pause end, I was left on hold for hours on and then hung up on without connecting to a person. I was without answers and forced to pay an exorbitantly high payment or else my credit would suffer. 
In XXXX, I was finally able to connect with someone and switch my plan back onto XXXX, which I should have been on in the first place. I filled out the needed paperwork and then was told that my loans for XXXX and XXXX would be put into administrative forbearance and I asked for a refund on my XXXX prior payments since they were in error. 
This now leaves my XXXX payment left because my administrative forbearance did not cover the first incorrect payment that was made. I am requesting that you either put my XXXX payment under the administrative forbearance or that you correct the payment total to be equivalent to my current monthly payment of {$1000.00} due to administrative errors and hardship caused on my account. 

If you request further documentation or have further questions please contact me directly at XXXX. I will be sending a copy of this letter to the State of Massachusetts where I reside as well as the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau.

The loans are serviced by EDfinancial. Back in XX/XX/XXXX, I set up autopay with the same account information I had used to make manual payments during the loan repayment pause. I had been making payments ahead of time despite the autopay setup since I wanted to reduce the interest more aggressively, but also wanted the autopay there in case I ever forgot to pay early. Eventually, I stopped because the portal said I was ahead by a couple of months but would be due for payment again starting on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I say this to show that though I had set up autopay in XXXX and everything showed properly on the client portal, Autopay had never been used up to this point. 

The autopay did not work and the account was starting to notify me that I had overdue balances today, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I went and checked the portal and the autopay displays everything set up properly, so I was very confused. My solution was to call the company as an authorized user to the account to try and determine why the autopay did not work. They told me not only do they not know why the autopay was denied. Furthermore, even though I just paid the past due amount and resubmitted for the autopay, I was told that the portal is incorrect in telling me the autopay will be enforced in 2-3 business days. I was told to expect 2-3 billing cycles ( 2-3 months ).

I am extremely dissatisfied with the following points here : 1. The call staff were unable to tell me what the issue was and why my autopay did not go through. 
2. I will need to wait 2-3 months to see if the second application will work, even though nothing has changed between the first and second applications for autopay. 
3. The client service portal displayed that the autopay was active despite being told it was not by the call staff, and the confirmation pop-up for resubmitting for autopay instructs the user that the autopay will start in 2-3 business days ( which is not accurate ).

Between the inaccurate website and the lack of information, I find it very frustrating that the loan company is being this difficult with me just trying to pay my loans off.","","EdFinancial Services","MA","XXXXX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-04,"Untimely response","No","N/A",8106072,2024

My first issue was back on my first bill in XXXX. I put in the information to my bank account using my correct ID number for this loan account and I provided the address information that I had on the bill. Apparently that is not the correct address as that does not go to the billing center which doesn't make sense considering that's the information given to me on the bill. I had to wait weeks for this payment to finally go through. One end it said it was paid but I never had the money taken out of my account. I was frustrated and becoming worried that I would not have the money in my account when they finally took it out AND that I would have to do another payment before this original payment was taken out ( essentially XXXX {$910.00} payments at once ). 

I finally contacted them when I noticed it wasn't being taken out as I'm now worried that it would mess up my credit score/interest charges, etc. They informed me that the check from my bank was being sent to the wrong office. I informed them that I have no other information about where to send and the correct information should have been provided. This was cleared up as I expressed my frustrations.

I have disputed my student loan balance for many years, and to date my loan is still {$18000.00} and taxed at 8.5 % interest. 

I started college in XX/XX/XXXX and at the time I received Pell Grants to fund my education. Additionally, I served in the military for 16 years ( Army Veteran ) and the Department of Defense paid {$20000.00} via my GI XXXX XXXX towards my student loans.

Between XXXX, a personal banker at XXXX convinced XXXX to consolidate all my student loans into XXXX loan. At the time I was young and naive, and I did not understand the ramifications of this financial arrangement and certainly did not know that this debt would morph into a massive balance due to high interest. 

The interest rate has never fallen below 8 % and I have been struggling to pay this loan off for many years. I am now XXXX XXXX XXXX and 90 % service-connected XXXX per VA and I would like to have my loan reviewed for accuracy and request loan forgiveness due to all the mismanagement, massive fees, high interest rates and late fees. 

Most of the loans that I consolidated were federal direct subsidized or unsubsidized loans that are now consolidated into a variable rate private loan. 
Additionally, XXXX is one of the schools accused by the Federal Trade Commission of misrepresenting its job and salary outcomes through ads. The university also settled with the Education Department and borrowers. 

I have never been able to write off payments on my tax refund, I have been charged late fees and massive interest and many other issues with XXXX loan which is now served by Navient student loan. To date, I still owe {$17000.00} on my loan despite many payments, consolidations, and the Department of Defense payment due to the high interest rate and constantly transferring my loan from one servicer to another. Its as if the Department of Defense payment were never made.

2024-02-08,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","On XX/XX/XXXX, with student loan payments set to start up again, I enrolled in auto-pay with my loan servicer, EdFinancial to make monthly payments on my debt ( see attached confirmation email from EdFinancial ). The estimated start date in that email for my auto-pay was XXXX, XXXX. This email led me to believe it was a confirmation of my auto-pay enrollment ( I have since learned from contacting the company that it is actually just a confirmation that I submitted to apply to auto-pay but not confirmation that I am actually enrolled - I will come back to this ). In XXXX I received the first letter in the mail stating that I had missed a payment. As mentioned above, I believed from the email send on XXXX that I had been successfully enrolled in auto-pay. I reached out to my loan servicer to get clarity on why my auto-pay wasn't working. I made a manual payment of {$250.00} to cover my missing payment and a little extra on XXXX. At that time it was clear my auto-payment hadn't been working so I re-enrolled. See confirmation email attached. Once again there is no language indicating that I will need to make manual payments until I am told in new communication otherwise. The estimated start date for my enrollment is XXXX. When I called the EdFinancial Support line it took them 3 weeks to get back to me with a response. See attached email. At that time I was told that by re-submitting my auto-pay form I had been moved to the back of the line for processing. On XX/XX/XXXX I received yet another letter in the mail telling me I had missed payments in XXXX. I submitted another manual payment of {$250.00} on XXXX and then I spoke over live chat with a member of their team to get an update on processing time. I was given the same information that my auto-pay had not in fact, been confirmed, but they were only confirming I'd submitted paper work for it, they also again shared that re-submitting my enrollment would move me back to the end of the line ( I shared feedback that they should communicate that to borrowers who are confused about why their auto-pay isn't working as I was ). I also shared feedback that they add language to their confirmation emails that clarifies it isn't confirmation of enrollment but is actually confirmation just of form submission and that borrowers should be told explicitly that they need to make manual payments until they receive a different type of confirmation. 

Additionally I am struggling overall with the slow processing time. My conversation with an EdFinancial chat team member on XXXX I was told that the processing time is 2 months ( one month longer than indicated in the original confirmation email ). I submitted my original auto-pay enrollment on XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX is more than 2 months later with no word to have me expect anything awry with my auto-pay until I was told I missed payments. Once again XXXX to today, XXXX is more than two months of processing time and my auto-pay enrollment is still not processed, nor would today 's chat bot team member clarify how far along my application was and when I might expect to receive the right type of confirmation letter to turn on my auto-pay. She continued to just list """" 2 billing cycles '' as the extent of timeline I should expect - and would not clarify when asked whether that meant from today ( XXXX ) or back from when it was submitted first on XXXX then again XXXX. 

Finally, a side note- in my chat bot conversation I shared feedback that this process felt disorganized and was told to refrain from being """" inappropriate. '' Not only should servicers be there to clearly communicate their policies to borrowers, in advance of borrowers facing complications from those policies, but they should also receive feedback that these processes are harming borrowers without saying that very valid feedback is inappropriate. 

Thank you CFPB, I hope EdFinancial will change their communications strategy and seek to better fulfill their mission of supporting borrowers to pay back their student loans.","","EdFinancial Services","MA","012XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-08,"Untimely response","No","N/A",8311357,2024

2024-01-12,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","I have 2 student loans that are currently with Nelnet. They have been mishandled since their inception in XXXX. They are both consolidation loans. I believe one is subsidized and one is unsubsidized. The debt balance is incorrect. According to my records, the balance should be at least {$20000.00} lower. According to my promissory note for the origination of the consolidation of these two loans, which I signed in XXXX XXXX XXXX my beginning balance should have been {$50000.00}. According to Nelnet, my previous lenders, and the FSAID website, my original disbursement on XXXX  was supposedly {$53000.00}. Then, when looking at the payment history that I printed from Navients website ( the company that had my loans before Covid ), my original disbursement/balance on XX/XX/XXXX was {$58000.00}. Then, after paying more than {$25000.00}, over the course of years, on these loans, my balance only continued to go up. While making active payments monthly, my balance only increased. This was NOT during a forbearance or deferment, and I have never had an income-based repayment or any other weird repayment process. The payment history that I mentioned earlier doesnt show a loan balance after each payment. There is no way for me to monitor what happened with the loan or make sense of the numbers. It is incredibly shady and none of the numbers add up. I have been trying to fight this since XXXX. 
Originally, I was refusing to pay and trying to get Navient to validate the debt. They just kept sending me the promissory note. The promissory note actually proves the debt is inaccurate! It proves the beginning balance to be wrong. They have never sent me any documents that tell what I agreed to pay and for how long. I have no actual loan papers. They just continually told me the loan was accurate and mine, while continuing to bill me. While trying to communicate my concerns, all anybody wanted to do was put me on a plan to get me out of delinquency. I filed a complaint with the FSAID Ombudsman and she eventually, after months, came back and told me that Navient told her the debt was valid! Thats it. No proof or explanation. She clearly didnt investigate anything. Very soon after that, my loans were taken over by the Department of Education because of the Cares Act for Covid. 
Last XXXX my loans came back. Nelnet is now servicing them. The payment has now increased by {$270.00} each month. My payments went from {$410.00} per month to {$680.00} per month! With Navient, my final payment was scheduled for XXXX. Nelnet clearly restructured my loan without any communication with me and without my consent. My newly structured loan was written to have 118 payments and a final payment in XXXX. This cant be legal. The beginning balance for the newly written loan is completely wrong. I am essentially restarting my repayment for my loans with a balance of {$62000.00}. This is {$12000.00} higher than what my original loan balance should have been and I have already paid more than {$25000.00} for it. They are literally billing me for money that I dont owe. To top it off, on the FSAID website, the section that shows how much I have paid to repay my loans, is only showing payments from XX/XX/XXXX to present. As of now, that is only showing 4 payments. It does not show ANY payments between XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX! This is not a valid debt! 
Choosing not to pay my loans while I disputed them only seemed to make things harder. Nobody listened to me. All anybody would say was that my loans were delinquent and they wanted to get me into a program to get them out of delinquency. It also got my loans passed around and made it impossible to handle. So, I have chosen to continue to put a hardship on my family and make the payments on these fraudulent loans until somebody helps me. This is not how it should be. When a loan is disputed, it should be placed on an administrative forbearance until the dispute is completed. However, I have been informed that they wont do that. Unfortunately, I also havent been able to get anybody to help me. In XXXX I sent Nelnet a dispute letter and I filed a complaint with the Ombudsman with the FSAID again. It has been almost 3 months and I have heard nothing from either of them. Right after filing with the Ombudsman I received an email informing me that I have filed a complaint and telling me my case number. There has been no communication since. After Nelnet received my dispute letter, they also sent me an email. The email said to continue making payments and that I would receive further communication within 15 to 20 days. I have received no further communication. Before my XXXX payment, I called their customer service department. I was on hold for 2.5 hours before I finally talked to somebody. One of the people I spoke to, named XXXX, confirmed that the dispute was still being worked on and that it would take 10 to 12 weeks. She encouraged me to apply for an income-based repayment. She said that even though my loans are FFELP loans, they qualify for all the IBR programs because the Cares Act made them belong to the Department of Education. I gave her an estimate of my income and she said I qualified and encouraged me to apply through the website. The website application process told me I qualified for an IDR and that my payments would be reduced by about {$250.00} per month. Within about a week, I received a letter telling me that I dont qualify, and it didnt say why! 
I am completely at the mercy of these corrupt school loan servicing companies. At this point, if I could sue, I would. Originally, all I wanted was for somebody to figure out the legitimate balance of my loans and rework a payment plan that would actually pay things down. That answer is no longer good enough for me. These companies need to be held accountable! 
In the past, I also tried to get the Credit Bureaus in on it. I asked them to remove the debt from my credit reports until they could validate the debt. They always just wrote back saying that the debt is valid. They clearly did no investigation work either. They also should be held accountable.","","Nelnet, Inc.","CO","XXXXX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-12,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8150706,2024

Had the co-signer not been paying the loan off it would have been part of the predatory loan settlement brought by several AGs a couple years ago. 

The co-signer is my ex-step father whom has been paying the loan for over 10 years, and was told by a judge in his divorce with my mom that he is responsible for it. As a single mom, who is already in a legal fight to get paid the child support/alimony I'm owed, I am unable to make payments on this loan. He has been the only one to ever pay on this loan. Now that he is no longer married to my mom, he intentionally stopped paying the loan so that he could try to work a settlement deal with them. Despite being a XXXX. This is where I am finding it hard to understand if this is legally available for Navient, because on the promissory note it states we are both jointly & severally liable for the full amount. They told me today that they approved him for waiver based on him letting them know I can pay it, despite the tax return information I have provided. 

While I have heard of a co-signer release, I have never heard of a co-signer waiver. Navient has just approved for the co-signor to pay a percentage of the loan off to have his name removed without affecting his credit, then leaving the remaining balance solely on myself even though I have provided evidence of not being able to afford payments. Nor would I be approved for a loan without a co-signor, currently. The supervisor even made a comment to me about whether or not I knew this would affect me being able to take the bar if I dont pay it, once they remove him. Once the co-signer pays the 70 % of the current loan amount, more than double of the original loan will be paid back to Navient. Even more, they offered to settle the loan for less than what they are accepting for the co-signor waiver. 

I have searched everywhere on the internet for information regarding co-signer waiver, cant find anything. I have tried to reach out to the top executives at Navient ( CFO & Chief Legal Officer ), regarding this issue, I have requested a signed copy of the original loan agreement, and no-one will email/call me back. While I have been provided the promissory note, they will not provide me with the full signed loan agreement. I was yelled at over the phone by a case manager saying they can do it but not explaining how, legally, where it is stated in the loan agreement. I feel like this is wrong, and was hoping you could maybe point me in the right direction.","","Navient Solutions, LLC.","TN","37064","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-23,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8408868,2024

2024-01-16,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I contacted Mohela XX/XX/XXXX to have my loan repayment plan changed to the extended graduate repayment plan. It is currently XX/XX/XXXX, and my plan has yet to be changed. I have spoken with many different Mohela supervisors over the course of six months and, in addition, submitted a prior complaint on the CFPB data base ( Complaint ID : XXXX ). Each time I have been told my repayment plan request change has been """" expedited ''. Some supervisors have gone so far to say that my plan would take effect """" when we get off the phone '' or """" at the end of this business day. '' None of that has been true. I have also repeatedly asked for the notes they have about my account and have been told they would be sent over... but they never have. 

I was making payments from XXXX to XXXX ( still on the repayment plan I did not want to be on ). In XXXX I received a notification from Mohela that my XXXX billing statement was given to me less than 21 days from the due date so Mohela was putting my account on an administrative forbearance and any payments made between XXXX and XXXX of XXXX  would count toward future payments ( or refunded if requested ). This was also Mohela 's resolutions for my prior CFPB complaint - even though my repayment plan still has not changed. However, since then I have neither been refunded nor have my prior payments gone toward my future payments as specified. 

I called Mohela yet again the beginning of XXXX. This time the representative told me ( XXXX ) my request was still pending but """" someone at Mohela didn't submit it correctly ''. Excuse me, what?! It's been XXXX month and I've talked with at least XXXX supervisors at this point. Is this true? If this is true, why was I not notified? I feel like I can't trust anything their representatives say though because nothing about this account has changed even when supervisors """" guarantee it will be done by the end of the week ''. 
( XXXX ) He noted how my account still says I owe XXXX XXXX  in XXXX even though I made payments from XXXX - XXXX totally {$16000.00}. My minimum payment is roughly XXXX dollars on the repayment plan they won't take me off for whatever reason. So, as confirmed with this representative, my XXXX bill ( and many future bills ) should be accounted for in my XXXX to XXXX payments. But for some reason Mohela is still saying I owe money in XXXX despite their own written correspondence saying these payments would apply to my future payments. 

So when will Mohela change my repayment plan and when will either my prior payments be refunded or counted toward future payments? 
I believe Mohela is mismanaging my loans and not being honest in their financial obligations to me, the borrower.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","CA","91106","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-16,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8161266,2024

So of course youre going to cover for your employees because you dont want to make the company look as bad as it already is. One employee told me pay what you can and you will not get reported. Ive heard this answer from numerous employees! Then 2 weeks later I get an alert saying my credit score went down. Once I called about the issue, they covered for their employee saying that they never told me that. Which was a lie. I also had one top employee tell me stop wasting your time calling because nothing is going to change. But they call you, leave voicemails, and emails about how they claim to want to help.

believe, i was very excited to start XXXX XXXX XXXX, my only problem is its not in a hands on classroom only online. my grades was a success, i mean i made nothing under a XXXX  average, everything was an Grade """" XXXX XXXX or a high """" XXXX i was excited, i knew it would be a journey but i was prepared, the problem arose months later when it was very hard communicating with student services, having to make online appts for the professor at XXXX to assit you with passwords locks, and system errors, and complications with the web pages, and apps, now i purchased a brand new laptop which was not the problem.I was determined to finish and complete the course so i vigoursly studied and put in extra time to take not just one test a week but actually 2-3 in which im sure my professor was impressed because when i did hear back from him he was bragging that i was doing extremely well and my grades were excellent. i was proud of myself. there was problems out of the website for XXXX and no matter how long it took i was dedicated to trying to resolve it with the school, uncfortunately it was still glitchy ad was not trying to put me in the system not for tests because i had not one problem with that only with the XXXX XXXX XXXX  downloadable app, in which there was no problem installing on my device, but the school system was kicking me out and saying my password was incorrect even after me and the professor with back and forth online, and even via communicating over the phone to get the correct info for log in but to no avail i was still receiving error messages on my end and he exhausted i guess. soon after my mother who lived around the corner suddenly got ill within a month time and then she passed away and i and my children had four more overwhelming tragic deaths that hit our family hard, and it was too overwhelming, so i took like 2 months off of class work but by then i was already at 89 % of completion and my grade point average i believe then went from an XXXX average to like a XXXX grade point average if not mistaken, i was heartbroken, and couldn't concentrate on studies, i basically was still determined to keep going when i was able to mentally and emotionally just finish and give it my all, the school offered a deference for like 2-3 months for me which i was totally grateful and i i think that may have started in XXXX of XXXX i believe, or stopped at XXXX XXXX either way i did have to start back paying like {$100.00} or {$100.00} dollars per month. so the total school contract was like XXXX so i paid from XXXX to XXXX and i know i sent off a payment certainly XX/XX/XXXX, in which all of my payments came out of Persons banking company from my debit card each month and i can provide statements to CFPB to prove that. also i was being charged a late fee in which included if i was like a day late i believe but from my understanding my payments was on auto draft, but however since my email was hacked and i had to get new card issued out also because it was lost/stolen from that bank it may have tried on those cards unsure but i also did let XXXX know i would continue paying them but then they had sent my school account as delinquent to a collection agency several of months later, and by then i was no longer residing at that same address, my landlord decided to sale the property as opposed to continue to rent it out, i was in aggreance since i was there for 7 years and needed to move to an difference environment and raise my family. i was although displaced, and after covid hit there was extinuating circumstances that prevented people from renting, and there was discriminatory practices, scams, and monetary issues with people that prevented certain things, everything was higher, unavoidable emergenies, and financial situations. i did try to continue my payment plan witht he school, and told them i wanted my certificate, they refused me receiving it saying """" its just like you have to start all over again and repay the same thing you already paid out to us from the beginning '', i didnt feel this was necessary or even fair because i paid out that already i think in actuality i had two months left of paying my balance off but the school would not allow it they wanted the balance of XXXX all over again. like i said i have proof of all the times i sent them money to the school because each payment i screenshot it and it was withdrawn from my bank account. i just had like one assignment left to do in that classroom in which there was several print outs on web of their school that i did satisfactory complete that assignment, there was no professor in site after the last password tech issues i was facing, come to find out the school did mention they kicked me out the system after a late payment but soon after i paid it i still couldnt retrieve the correct password and log in like i had before so basically iwas on that site for two days on the last part of the course, i had like the pharmacy scripts, and the test for that and the exam, and i emailed professor, called XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, even decided to come to norcross in which they forbid because they said no students come to campus or whatnot, so my communication was limited, i had no assistance, unsure what happened to the professor but his emails and the appts online was going ignore/unanswered,. from my understanding the school had to give me externship via XXXX and another pharmacy companies in which they did in fact state and then there was drug testing from a lab in area, and background checks, even testing centers available to do the certification, but thats a misconception, deception, false advertisemtn whatever you want to call it because soon as you are about to finish the course they will tell you otherwise about how you have to go through another process that they never told you about, now i could of received licensing through another government agency as long as i was enrolled in XXXX so i really didnt need the certification, also received job offers from XXXX  pharmacy even with a license pharmacy didnt need a certification, they train, and pay for XXXX but XXXX was withholding things, like when the testing center requested that they pay like XXXX does state when students go to test at the XXXX XXXX in georgia they pay themselves, that info was disceptive because they said we are not going to pay. so its a false advertising just to get your money. so now im stuff without ac career or the income that i previous had and they are wanting me to pay back two years

They ran my credit and I was denied due to """" borrower income insufficient in relation to the debt. '' After they ran my credit, they informed me that I was unable to apply with a cosigner, even though my current loans have a cosigner. Prior to running my credit, I was not informed what """" passing a credit check '' meant. 

Following this call, I reached out to a friend of the family who is knowledgeable in the financial industry. I asked why I could not apply for a Debt Consolidation Loan with a cosigner. 

On XX/XX/2024 at XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, we called Discover and XXXX at Discover transferred us to XXXX in the Consolidation Department in XXXX. He did not verify any of my personal information prior to disclosing any information on the phone call, nor did he ask if it was okay to disclose any confidential/nonpublic personal information with the family friend who was on the line. 

We asked for clarification as to why I was unable to apply with a cosigner. 
We were informed that I needed to pass a credit check. We inquired what """" passing a credit check '' meant. At that time, we were told that I had to qualify independently. This information was not disclosed to me on my first call prior to running my credit. On the second phone call, we were told on www.Discover.com/student-loans/consolidation.html under that section, there is a common consolidation loan question- Am I eligible for a Discover XXXXrivate Consolidation Loan? It says """" Pass a credit check. '' Nowhere on the website does it say I had to pass it independently. 

After further questioning with XXXX, he stated that Discover 's policy is if you can not qualify independently, you can not qualify with a cosigner. 

I feel I have been discriminated against. Had I been able to qualify with a cosigner, I could have potentially had one loan at a fixed rate of 5.99 % XXXX % according to the website. Due to not qualifying on my own and not being allowed to qualify with a cosigner, I have five loans with variable rates between 6.340 % XXXX % which results in a higher monthly payment and therefore, more interest paid over the life of the loan. 

I feel it is discriminatory to allow those who qualify on their own to get a lower interest rate with a cosigner while not allowing cosigners for those who do not qualify on their own. This puts undue burden on borrowers who need a cosigner by keeping them in higher interest rate loans. I pay more on my loans because I do not qualify on my own but would possibly qualify with a cosigner, which would allow me to pay less.","","DISCOVER BANK","MO","631XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-10,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8133573,2024

Aidvantage confirmed that the processing was completed and recently advised that my first payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX. In preparation, I'd set up Auto Pay for my account, to ensure timely payment. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notification from Aidvantage stating Auto Pay has been canceled for my account since payment is not due within 45 days. When I try to set it up again, a message states this can not be done since my account is not in repayment. Further, my account no longer shows any amount due on XX/XX/XXXX. Rather, it shows {$0.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX. My loan details show """" Awaiting Form Administrative Forbearance. '' I was never advised of any forbearance being placed on my account, nor was any information requested from me. My most recent correspondence with Aidvantage is their confirmation of the SAVE plan, my payment amount and due date. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a message to Aidvantage requesting clarification. No response has been received. I am now unsure as to when payment is due and confused as to why I can not set up Auto Pay to ensure payment is timely. 
Thank you in advance for any assistance in resolving this matter.","","Maximus Education, LLC dba Aidvantage","CA","94530","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-01,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8085422,2024

I was forgiven last summer, Mohela representatives have told me over the phone that I am deserving of a refund and I shouldve gotten it in 60 days or something and recognize that I havent. 

Thats where the good will ends. You call and are told you will be talking to a professional but the professional has been told to pretend they are in training whenever someone asks about getting a refund owed to them. If you ask for a supervisor or someone who knows what they are doing they put you on hold for upwards of XXXX minutes.

( I have talked to at least XXXX people personally who have heard these excuses and been given the run around ). 

XXXX. You have to resubmit paperwork- no I dont. Its all on the website, the situation is visible to everyone involved but they want to keep the money instead of refund it. 

XXXX. This aint our job you have to call the department of education XXXX this is also an untrue. Mohela handled every part of the XXXX process. They are paid by the government to do that. 

XXXX. We dont know why you didnt get it but we cant make it happen- this is probably true but they refuse to put you on the phone with someone who can. 

I think I made XXXX payments too many. The last payment I made was I think between $ XXXX {$570.00} a month. XXXX XXXX and that is a lot of money for my family who is both public servants raising XXXX children on public servants salary.

2024-01-10,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","I was making payments to another loan servicer ( XXXX ) when my loan was transferred to Mohela. There were 5 outstanding payments in the amount of {$60.00} each that were paid to XXXX when my account was being transferred. In XX/XX/2023, after being notified that my account was transferred to Mohela, I called Mohela immediately and inquired about the {$60.00} payments. At that point, they only had 1-2 of the payment. I made sure to explain that these payments should be applied to Loan 3. I called every month after checking on the payments to ensure that they were applied correctly. Despite my calls, Mohela misapplied 3 payments. 

In XX/XX/2023, I was advised that Loan 1 & 2 would be discharged due to my time working in the US military and in the public service. I realized that 2 payments were still missing, and I wanted to ensure that the payments would be applied correctly to Loan 3. I called Mohela and XXXX several times inquiring about the payments and making sure that the payments would be applied to Loan 3. Although XXXX transferred the amounts in XXXX, the payments did not post to my account until XX/XX/November2023. Additionally, the payments posted to the wrong loans : Loans 1 & 2. The payments were supposed to post to Loan 3.

Mohela was able to locate 1 misapplied payment and correct the misapplication before Loan 1 & Loan 2 were discharged. In fact, I am receiving a refund for this misapplication in the amount of {$32.00} and {$22.00}. However, Mohela failed to correct a {$60.00} misapplied amount until after the discharge ( Note : I am not sure about this because I have received different guidance from different Mohela reps about this. Per the rep today, the smaller refunded amounts do not reflect the misapplied payments. When I ask what they represent, she said the overpayment on the principal, but was not able to tell me how this overpayment occurred. ) Here is the issue : The {$60.00} was removed from Loan 2, which was discharged. They are refunding me the {$60.00} since I full paid Loan 3, and that payment should have applied to Loan 3. ( Note : This is similar to the refund of the {$32.00} and {$22.00}. ) Because the {$60.00} amount was misapplied, Mohela did not submit that amount in the Loan 2 discharge. They are in turn billing me for this same amount. I have explained that if they had properly applied all payments correctly, then the full amount for Loan 2 would have been submitted with the discharge and written off in Loan 2. Currently my account is about to be in Collection status. I would like to have this resolved before this takes a negative action and affects my employment and credit.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","GA","310XX","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-10,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8140450,2024

2024-01-22,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","On XX/XX/2021, I was targeted by a Summit Horizon agent and fraudulently induced into purchasing purported student loan debt relief services. Over the course of several phone conversations, Summit Horizon falsely represented that they could offer me loan consolidation and forgiveness. This sale of purported loan consolidation and forgiveness was plainly fraudulent, and the promise of loan forgiveness was a deliberate misrepresentation designed to deceive me into purchasing services. Since signing a contract with Summit Horizon, my student loans have not been forgiven. I now understand that my student loans can only be forgiven by the federal government and any forgiveness would require several preconditions that are completely out of the control of Summit Horizon.

Summit Horizon engaged in a variety of unlawful activities in an attempt to sell me worthless services. First, Summit Horizon violated the XXXX XXXX XXXX by charging me XXXX up-front payments, XXXX of {$4000.00} and another for {$1500.00} before the services sold had been completed. The XXXX forbids telemarketers from collecting payments of any kind before the services they are selling have been completed and provided to the buyer. Summit Horizon charged me {$4000.00} on XX/XX/2021, a day after I had first received an unsolicited phone call from Summit Horizon, along with another {$1500.00} on XX/XX/2021, weeks before any services promised were supposedly rendered to me. 


Secondly, the Summit Horizon agent who called me on the phone made numerous misrepresentations to me, including promising that by purchasing services, I would receive a lower interest rate on my loans and see the funds I paid to Summit Horizon applied to my student loan balance after a year. Summit Horizon never applied the funds I paid to my student loan balance. In fact, all Summit Horizon did for me was consolidate my Federal Direct loans, which was entirely unnecessary, and enroll me in the Revised Pay as You Earn ( XXXX ) plan, both of which are free government programs. Summit Horizon never disclosed to me that all of its services were available for free from the government.

To be abundantly clear, the Summit Horizon agent contacted me without my solicitation and convinced me to pay Summit Horizon {$4000.00} on the day of our first phone conversation before any contract for services supposedly rendered was signed. Weeks later, the same agent called me again with a better offer and convinced me to pay an additional {$1500.00} to Summit Horizon with the promise that I would receive my {$4000.00} back. In sum, I was convinced to pay Summit Horizon {$5500.00} over XXXX separate transactions for loan consolidation and forgiveness services. The services provided to me by Summit Horizon consisted entirely of applying to enroll me in an IDR planspecifically, XXXX. I am able to obtain this service free of charge at any time by logging on to the Department of Education website and filling out a five-page form, so the services that were sold to me at the outrageous price of {$1500.00} were completely, totally worthless, in addition to Summit Horizon taking {$4000.00} from me and not applying any of that money to my student loan balance.

I called Nelnet and waited 4 hours to speak to someone. I was told that a manager had submitted an appeal letter on my behalf to investigate why the loan forgiveness was reversed and the balance was set to the original amount. I called three weeks later to follow up and was on hold for 3 hours and 48 minutes. They were not able to explain if there was any decision made or when the loan would be forgiven. I was told that it could take between 2 weeks and 90 days to get a decision and to keep checking the website. Nelnet placed me in an admin forbearance for 24 months so I do not have to make payments, but the interest keeps growing. I am not able to sit on hold every week for 4 hours until they can answer my call. I am not able to speak to a manager or a higher-up person - all conversations must go through the person who answered your call, while you are put back on hold.

One those are taken care of, the remaining loans will be reevaluated for IDR forgiveness. I spoke to a contact at your office this evening and he said the loan should have been forgiven since I received a letter stating the entire loan was to be forgiven - not just a portion of it. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX added a message XX/XX/XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX Here is a copy of the letter from Nelnet stating that I am applying for the FSA Borrower Defense to Repayment Program - but I never applied for this. The manager at Nelnet was to apply for an appeal to the forgiveness reversal. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX added a message XX/XX/XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX Here is a screenshot of my loans from Nelnet. It shows that I am on XXXX XXXX but I have never been in the military, XXXX XXXX XXXX added a message XX/XX/XXXX XXXX AM Both of my consolidated loans were forgiven under the IDR Biden-Harris Administration 's one-time account adjustment. One of the loans was reversed and now I am in the FSA Borrower Defense to Repayment Program. Nelnet told me they were appealing the reversal NOT applying to this program. This debt relief was processed as part of the Biden-Harris Administration 's one-time account adjustment because your student loan ( s ) have been in repayment for at least 20 or 25 years. An adjustment to your account updated the number of payments that qualify for income-driven repayment ( IDR ) forgiveness. This forgiveness is effective as of XX/XX/XXXX. 

Nelnet did not respond to the Obudsman groud or to me. I am supposed to be in Admin forbearance because the outstanding load is flagged for forgiveness but I am not able to get that applied by Nelnet.

XX/XX/XXXX o Received notification that my loans were being put in administrative forbearance. Called Mohela because I did not request this. 
o Spoke with XXXX o She stated that I was on the Level payment plan and confirmed that this is compatible with PSLF. 
o I asked if I can go on an administrative forbearance when I get closer to 120 payments ( as I was previously advised by Mohela ). She said no. I can not go on an administrative forbearance until my payment tracker says 120 qualifying payments XX/XX/XXXX o I was unable to get some previous employers to certify my employment due to staff turnover. I was advised to upload my W2s. I did this when my loans were still at XXXX. I uploaded them all again in XX/XX/XXXX, individually with the form and W2 to Mohela as was requested. 
o Spoke with XXXX o I inquired about what was taking so long for my W2s to be reviewed as I had been told that it could take up to 90 days and we were now at that threshold. XXXX stated that she would put in a request to expedite the processing of my W2s and that this should move me to the top of the list. She stated I would receive notification by XX/XX/XXXX that someone was working on this task. 
o Also inquired about my monthly payment because the statement was only showing loans 3-7. She did not know why the statement was only showing those loans but advised that the monthly payment is {$440.00} XX/XX/XXXX o I called because the W2s still had not been processed and to request a refund for the payments made in XXXX XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX since these were the months I was placed in an administrative forbearance and could use that money now instead of waiting for them to apply it to loans in the future. 
o Spoke with XXXX o Regarding the W2s : XXXX stated that the request to expedite processing of my W2s was cancelled because Mohela is very far behind in processing documents. She stated that at this time, average processing time for W2s is 82 days. I advised that it had already been well over the 90 days I was told previously. XXXX stated that as of this date, they were processing W2s from XX/XX/XXXX and that mine should be processed by the end of XX/XX/XXXX ( this would be five months since I uploaded them the second time ). 
o On this date, I requested a refund for the payments I made during the administrative forbearance that was placed on my account for the months of XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX in the amounts of {$730.00}, {$570.00}, and {$320.00} respectively. 
o XXXX stated that she would submit the request for the refund and that it would take 10 days for the refund to be processed. 
o I inquired, What is it doesnt occur within those 10 days? XXXX stated, Wait another 30 days. When I asked what that 30-day timeframe was referencing, she had no answer, just to wait. 
XX/XX/XXXX o I called to address the following problems : XX/XX/XXXX was no longer being counted as a qualifying payment month, I received a notice stating that my account was now 30 days past due, and I inquired about my refunds as I had not received them yet. My billing statement dated XX/XX/XXXX shows current amount due on XXXX {$0.00} and amount past due= {$0.00}. Billing statement dated XX/XX/XXXX shows amount past due= {$0.00} and current amount due on XXXX {$440.00}. 
o Spoke with XXXX. 
o Regarding XX/XX/XXXX no longer being counted as a qualifying payment, she stated that they are working on fixing these and that there is no estimated timeframe for this to be corrected. 
o Regarding the notice I received stating the account was 30 days past due, she stated a task was entered on XX/XX/XXXX regarding this and that it generally takes 2-3 business days to process these tasks. 
o XXXX stated that these two issues are related, they will process the task and everything will be corrected. 
o Regarding the refunds since it had been more than 10 days, she stated Due to backlog, refunds can be delayed up to 60 days regardless of the type of refund. XXXX confirmed that the request for the refund was submitted on XX/XX/XXXX. 
o I was then transferred to XXXX with the advanced team. 
o XXXX stated that XX/XX/XXXX not counting as qualifying and the past due amount are two separate issues ( contrary to what XXXX stated ). 
o XXXX stated that the mandatory forbearance that was placed on my account was entered incorrectly and ended on XX/XX/XXXX instead of XX/XX/XXXX. She stated she can correct this to have the end date be at the end of XX/XX/XXXX like it should be. This reportedly takes 2-3 business days to correct. She also stated that this will correct the issue of XX/XX/XXXX not counting as qualifying and will correct the account being 30 days past due. 
o XXXX had no information or update on when I can expect the refunds previously requested. 
XX/XX/XXXX o I had my husband call. 
o Spoke with XXXX who was reported to be in training but with her trainer. 
o XXXX stated the refund was authorized on XX/XX/XXXX and will be back in our checking account on or around XX/XX/XXXX but that it takes approximately two weeks. 
o He was then transferred to XXXX and her support team. 
o XXXX stated that the administrative forbearance was only applied to XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. When we requested the refund for the forbearance period, it was processed and then left XX/XX/XXXX being due because the forbearance wasnt applied. 
o XXXX stated that XXXX should have had an amount due on the statement but that somehow it did not. 
o XXXX stated there is no credit reporting until 90 days past due XX/XX/XXXX o I called because I received another notice stating that I am behind I payments still and because I still have not received the refund. 
o Spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX stated that the forbearance had been updated to reflect the end of XX/XX/XXXX but that the account is still showing a past amount due from XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$330.00}. 
o XXXX had no update on my refund or when it should be expected. 
o I spoke with my husband who looked at the account after I got off the phone. 
o The account was still showing that I owe for XX/XX/XXXX and that XX/XX/XXXX is still not counting as a qualifying payment. The amount due ( {$330.00} ) still includes the amount from XX/XX/XXXX Please note that I have pictures of the account and statements, however, they are too large to upload and I am unable to make them any smaller.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","IL","626XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-03-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8477082,2024

2. According to my FSA.gov account activity, the application was processed and review completed by FSA, and then sent to my loan servicer Mohela. 
3. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I spoke with a customer service agent at Mohela to request an update on the status of my application review, which has still not been implemented. 
4. The customer service representative confirmed that my SAVE Plan application is still in review, and was unable to give me any estimated timeframe or expectation of how long my application will take to process. She confirmed that some SAVE Plan applications have been successfully processed and implemented, but was unable to provide any general timeline for how long that process took on average, or what I could expect for my application. 
5. The options I were given while I wait indefinitely for my application to process were to either : - Continue to put my account in forbearance so that I'm not required to make payments, but will continue to accrue interest. Forbearance periods are only 3 months long, and it will be my responsibility to continue to contact them and re-apply for forbearance every 3 months as long as my SAVE Plan application is still being processed ; or - Continue making payments at the amount due on my current plan, which is twice the amount of my estimated SAVE Plan monthly payment. 

The problem : Mohela has essentially put my application into an indefinite """" holding period. '' Unless I want to keep my account in forbearance and continue accruing interest, I'm expected to continue making payments at my current monthly payment amount indefinitely, with no estimated timeline for when I'll be switched to the SAVE Plan that I've applied for. 
This means ( and the customer service agent agreed ) that I theoretically could continue repaying my loan at my current monthly payment amount for years and even pay off my loan before Mohela processes my SAVE Plan application.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","DC","20007","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-23,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8409840,2024

I stayed on the plan for a few months, then spoke to XXXX, and they told me that this advice is false. This means that Mohela is hiring and training people who uniformly either don't understand PLSF or that Mohela has specific people who are providing incorrect information. Either way, this has cost me money. I have reached out to Mohela via email and phone and their response rates are terrible via email. I just received an email on XX/XX/XXXX regarding an email I sent on XX/XX/XXXX. The email explains that I should receive a response in 15 business days. This is an outrageous amount of time to wait for an email reply. They are basically saying that it takes them over a month to even acknowledge my email.

2024-01-10,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Incorrect information on your report","Information belongs to someone else","My rights, as protected under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( b ), have been blatantly disregarded, leading to significant personal and financial distress. 

Despite my repeated attempts to rectify these inaccuracies, including direct communication and provision of evidence to your the credit reporting agencies, the wrongful information persists. Under the FCRA, you are obligated to conduct a thorough and reasonable investigation of disputed information upon receipt of a consumers dispute. Failure to do so, as evidenced in my case, is a direct violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ). 

I have never knowingly entered into any agreement or contract with Navient or XXXX, nor with any entities they claim to represent. The documentation provided by Navient in response to my request for proof of debt was grossly inaccurate, containing personal information and a name not attributable to me. This is a clear violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), which requires credit reporting agencies to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates. 

Moreover, XXXX has completely neglected to respond to my requests for validation, further exacerbating the issue. This non-compliance is an infringement of my rights under the FCRA and demonstrates a lack of due diligence required by law. 

The ongoing misreporting of my credit history has led to significant financial loss, reputational damage, and emotional distress. This situation is further compounded by the fact that I have been a victim of identity theft, a circumstance that has been aggravated by the widely reported XXXX data breach. Despite providing substantial evidence to support my claims of identity theft, as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2, my documentation has been repeatedly overlooked for 2+ years now. I have compiled multiple certified green receipts between these companies showing proof that I have repeatedly mailed via USPS documentation proving these accounts to be inaccurate, incomplete and not mine yet Navient and XXXX continue to willfully report this false information on my CONSUMER file. 

To date, the resolution of disputes I filed, most recently on XX/XX/, has been grossly mishandled. Notices from XXXX, for instance, declare the account in question as certified by Navient and XXXX without providing requisite proof. This approach not only contravenes the FCRA stipulations for accuracy and verification but also my rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act ( CCPA ), which emphasizes fair and respectful treatment of consumers in the credit marketplace. 

The negligence exhibited by your organizations in handling my credit information is a clear violation of the FCRA, particularly sections pertaining to the accuracy and integrity of credit reporting ( 15 U.S. Code 1681e and 1681i ). This negligence has cost me time, money, and a significant detriment to my financial reputation and enjoyment of life. 

Consequently, I demand the immediate and complete removal of all false information from my consumer file pertaining to the alleged accounts. Should this issue not be resolved promptly and satisfactorily, I am prepared to escalate this matter by filing formal complaints with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), the XXXX XXXX XXXX, the federal Bureau of Investigation, ( FBI ) and pursue legal action in the appropriate civil courts. 

I expect a written response confirming the rectification of these inaccuracies and a detailed report of your investigation findings, sent to me via the United States Postal Service, as a matter of urgency and legal compliance. 

Once again, I do not, nor have I ever had a loan or a contract with Navient or XXXX and am requesting a copy of the original contract in question, signature and ID used to verify the identity of the individual Navient and XXXX claim owe them. I demand a copy of the alleged contract with my signature on it the displays my information, signature and ID and if no such contract can be produced, I demand that these fraudulent accounts be removed from my CONSUMER file immediately.","","Navient Solutions, LLC.","AZ","85041","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-10,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8138001,2024

There are 8 total sub-loans on this account so from each payment, a portion of it is applied to each of the subloans. 
In their incompetence, they recorded 5 of the sub-loan payments correctly. But three they applied as a charge instead of a credit. 
And now they keep telling me my payment is past due. BUT IT IS NOT. 
They finally acknowledged the error about a month ago, after about 3 hours on the phone, with multiple people, including one that hung up on me once they saw the error was actually their own. 
Eventually they said they understood the error and they would fix it... but it would take 5 to 6 weeks! 
That is the height of incompetence. This is something that would take a few keystrokes, and it SHOULD be fixed immediately. But it's now been over a month and they STILL have not fixed it. 
I called again last week to make sure it's still proceeding. They claimed that it was, and it would be corrected by Friday ( XX/XX/XXXX ). It has still not been fixed ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ).

In XXXX, I logged in to find two of my loans, for {$41000.00} had not been moved to XXXX  and my account was past due for {$460.00}.

2024-02-08,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I must convey my concern regarding the persistent failure of Nelnet to acknowledge and address your repeated attempts to provide feedback regarding the allocation of overpayments towards loans with the lowest outstanding balances. 

Despite your diligent efforts to communicate your preferences for the allocation of funds, Nelnet has displayed a pattern of disregard for your requests, thereby failing to adhere to the terms and conditions outlined in your loan agreement. Specifically, Nelnet 's refusal to post overpayments in accordance with your explicit instructions to prioritize loans with the lowest debt first constitutes a breach of contract. 

This ongoing failure on the part of Nelnet to comply with your reasonable requests not only undermines the integrity of the contractual relationship between you and Nelnet but also raises concerns regarding Nelnet 's adherence to regulatory requirements governing loan servicing practices. 

In light of these circumstances, I am prepared to take appropriate legal action to ensure that Nelnet rectifies this matter promptly and in accordance with the terms of your loan agreement. It is imperative that Nelnet acknowledges and respects your rights as a borrower, including your entitlement to have overpayments applied in a manner that aligns with your financial objectives and preferences. 

Please be advised that further failure on the part of Nelnet to address this issue satisfactorily may necessitate escalation of this matter to relevant regulatory authorities and pursuit of legal remedies to safeguard your interests and enforce compliance with applicable laws and contractual obligations. 

I strongly encourage Nelnet to reconsider its position and take immediate steps to remedy this situation to avoid any further escalation of this matter.","","Nelnet, Inc.","FL","321XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-08,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8306249,2024

I am also owed a refund of my monthly payments since I met 120 payments and they are still taking my payment each month. It's simple math but Mohela refused to look carefully at my forms and consider what I am stating to them. Please help in getting them to forgive my loans and refund payments I have made since I should have been forgiven.

I subsequently received multiple messages in my inbox on the Nelnet site about my school deferment request being approved ( I did not make this request, though perhaps this was the COVID forbearance? Though it didn't say that. Very confusing ). 

When I logged into my account, I saw that many of my accounts were labeled as under the Standard repayment plan ( I was always under income-driven repayment, even at Great Lakes , so this was incorrect ). 

I applied for the income driven repayment plan SAVE in XX/XX/XXXX, expecting that by the time student loan payments were due in XXXX, my plan would be approved and I would be paying no interest due to my income. I was subsequently placed on an administrative forbearance due to the company being unable to handle the volume of applications. My application was finally approved in this month ( XX/XX/XXXX, five months later ) I have since accrued over {$8000.00} in interest, and this is growing daily. Even though my SAVE application was approved, for some reason my due date is in XX/XX/XXXX ( so interest is continuing to accrue ). 

I am of the understanding that interest should not have been accruing under the administrative forbearance ( as per the Department of Education ), so the interest accrued should be adjusted to {$0.00}. I am also of the understanding ( per the DOE ) that I should be getting credit for income-driven repayment forgiveness for each month spent in forbearance.","","Nelnet, Inc.","OR","97233","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-20,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8384339,2024

2024-01-23,"Student loan","Private student loan","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I really could use some assistance with having Navient correct the 2 major ongoing issues I am having with my 3 private student loans serviced by them, dating back to the time when Navient and SallieMae were one company. I have brought this to their attention numerous times with no resolution, starting with the first call I had with their supervisor, XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX. She sent my case to the customer advocate team. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Navient dated XX/XX/XXXX. This contained a Declining Balance letter and account history for all private student loans. This history contains the following statement on the bottom of every page : This financial history removes offsetting transaction on your account that do not impact your loan balance. This is to avoid confusion with administrative adjustments processed on your account. I have compared this data to the information available to me when logged into my account on XXXX. I printed the account history for all 3 of my private student loans, along with downloading the CSV file. I have attached scans of these printouts, including my mark-ups, for your reference. When comparing the printout to the declining balance history letter received on XX/XX/XXXX with the account histories printed on XX/XX/XXXX, you will be able to see 3 key differences across all 3 loans. The first is that the Declining Balance letter shows a starting principal balance that matches the amount disbursed on the day it was disbursed. On the scanned printouts, the unpaid principal balance shows an amount considerably higher than what was disbursed. The second is that the XXXX Resale transaction on the account history printout has been omitted in the declining balance history across all 3 loans. The amount of the Resale transaction is the exact difference between the amount disbursed and the unpaid principal balance amount on the day of disbursement. Because interest on a loan is calculated using the unpaid principal balance, and the unpaid principal balance was higher than owed since the date of disbursement, the total amount of interest calculated and either paid or capitalized for the life of the loan is considerably higher than was supposed to be calculated. I also believe that Navient is fully aware of this error and is trying to hide it due to the Resale transactions being omitted. They have since then removed this transaction from my XXXX account history and changed the starting principal balance to match the actual amount disbursed. This is all outlined in detail below. The third key difference is the fact that the Late Fee Reversal transaction was omitted in the Declining Balance History Letter. As you can see by the scanned printouts, on XX/XX/XXXX all late fees currently owed were reversed, rendering them no longer owed. Over the past 10 years, Navient has allocated portions of my payments to pay for late fees that are not owed. 

Since receiving this on XX/XX/XXXX, I have spoken to numerous customer service representatives and supervisors. They have created numerous tickets for the customer advocate department. Each time, informing me that Navient has done nothing wrong, then harassing me with multiple daily phone calls from different phone numbers. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent an email to XXXX XXXX. According to an email I received from her on XX/XX/XXXX, she works in the customer advocate department. She had emailed me an updated copy of the Declining Balance letter, along with copies of my loan applications and other terms of the loans. In response, I attached documented evidence printed from my portal on XXXX clearly showing the errors on my account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email acknowledging receipt of it. Since then, there has been no resolution to these issues. On the XXXX of each month I am faced with a choice to pay a minimum amount to keep negative credit reporting from being reported to the 3 credit bureaus, or cause damage to my credit rating. It is not fair or ethical for a company to continue to put their customer in that position and ignore the evidence that has been presented to them. 

Details for Issue 1 : The first issue dates back to the date of disbursement for each of the Private Student Loans I have serviced with them. From day 1, they had the incorrect unpaid principal balance in place, directly impacting the amount of interest that was calculated and then either paid or capitalized and added to the principal balance. This issue went on throughout the life of all 3 of my private student loans. On XXXX XXXX XXXX, Navient acquired my loans from SallieMae. On this date, the difference between the actual amount disbursed and the incorrect principal balance on date of disbursement was credited to the current outstanding principal balance. This is notated with the description Resale on each of them. What they had failed to do was credit the amount of extra interest calculated for the time period between disbursement and XX/XX/XXXX. Please see below detailing all this out : Per Declining Balance Letter Received XXXX and XXXX printout dated XX/XX/XXXX : The first loan ( XXXX ) was disbursed on XX/XX/XXXX for the amount of {$4600.00}, The second loan ( XXXX ) was disbursed on XX/XX/XXXX for the amount of {$4800.00} The third loan ( XXXX ) was disbursed on XXXX XXXX XXXX for the amount of {$1800.00} Total Actual Amount of Private Student Loans disbursed : {$11000.00} Per XXXX printout dated XX/XX/XXXX : On the date of Disbursement, SallieMae ( Navient ) notated that the unpaid principal balance owed was the following : XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) Unpaid Principal Balance Per Navient/SallieMae : {$9300.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Unpaid Principal Balance Per Navient/SallieMae : {$7700.00} XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) Unpaid Principal Balance Per Navient/SallieMae : {$4000.00} Total Unpaid Principal Balance of Private Student Loans per Navient/SallieMae : {$21000.00} The total actual amount owed after school refunds, prior to interest being capitalized on XX/XX/XXXX : {$6400.00} Total Principal Balance per Navient.com printout dated XX/XX/XXXX after School Refunds, prior to interest being capitalized on XX/XX/XXXX : {$16000.00} The difference between the actual amount owed and unpaid principal balance documented per Navient.com printout dated XX/XX/XXXX is {$9800.00}. This amount is 46.7 % higher than the actual amount owed at the time of disbursement and 60.5 % higher than the actual amount owed after School Refunds were credited to the principal balance. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, interest during the time period between disbursement and that date, was capitalized. The issue is that SallieMae ( Navient ) calculated the interest on the wrong principal balances. This information can be referenced using the XXXX loan history Printouts Dated XX/XX/XXXX and Interest Rate Calculated Using Incorrect Unpaid Principal Balance Comparison PDF files created from the downloaded CSV files from XXXX. Please see below detailing this out : Loan XXXX : Because the Principal Balance per XXXX and downloaded CSV file from XXXX was {$9300.00} on day of disbursement, {$8700.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$7700.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, and {$7600.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, the interest that was capitalized on XX/XX/XXXX was {$1200.00}. Based on those facts provided by Navient.com that would make the average interest rate that I was paying during that timeframe 5.888 %, calculated on a daily basis. 
Using the 5.888 % interest rate calculated daily, using the correct Principal Balance, the total interest, that should have been capitalized would have been {$530.00}. This is a difference of {$750.00} in extra interest being capitalized and added to principal. 

Loan XXXX : Because the Principal Balance per Navient.com and downloaded CSV file from Navient.com was {$7700.00} on the day of disbursement, {$6600.00} on XXXX XXXX XXXX, {$5400.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, and {$4500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, the interest that was capitalized on XX/XX/XXXX was {$710.00}. Based on those facts provided by XXXX, that would make the average interest rate that I was paying 6.455 %, calculated on a daily basis. 
Using the 6.455 % interest rate, calculated daily using the correct Principal Balance, the total interest that should have been capitalized would have been {$330.00}. This is a difference of {$370.00} in extra interest being capitalized and added to principal. 

Loan XXXX : Because the Principal Balance per XXXX and downloaded CSV file from XXXX was {$4000.00} on the day of disbursement, the interest that was capitalized on XX/XX/XXXX was {$170.00}. Based on those facts provided by XXXX, that would make the average interest rate that I was paying 6.810 %, calculated on a daily basis. 
Using the 6.810 % interest rate, calculated daily using the correct Principal Balance, the total interest that should have been capitalized would have been {$80.00}. This is a difference of {$97.00} in extra interest being capitalized and added to principal. 

Based on the above facts and calculations, the total amount of extra interest calculated and capitalized across all 3 private student loans on XX/XX/XXXX was {$1200.00}. This means that on XX/XX/XXXX the total principal balance that SallieMae ( Navient ) had calculated interest on was {$18000.00}. The breakdown for each loan from Navient.com is below. This can be viewed on the Navient.com scanned printout dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 

XXXX : {$8900.00} XXXX : {$5200.00} XXXX : {$4200.00} Based on that, on XX/XX/XXXX the principal balance that interest was calculated on was off by {$11000.00}. This is outlined below : XXXX : {$5400.00} ( {$4700.00} Error in principal on disbursement date, plus {$750.00} in extra interest ) XXXX : {$3200.00} ( {$2900.00} Error in principal on disbursement date, plus {$370.00} in extra interest ) XXXX : {$2300.00} ( {$2200.00} Error in principal on disbursement date, plus {$97.00} in extra interest ) This practice of SallieMae ( Navient ) calculating interest on the wrong principal balance owed went on throughout the entire life of all 3 private student loans. This was partly corrected on XX/XX/XXXX. This was the date that Navient took over the loans from SallieMae. On that date, the difference between the actual disbursement and the principal balance keyed in on the date of disbursement was credited back to the principal balance. This is shown on the XXXX printout of my loan history dated XX/XX/XXXX and the Interest Rate Calculated Using Incorrect Unpaid Principal Balance Comparison PDF Files created from the CSV downloads from XXXX. However, they failed to credit back the extra interest calculated and either paid or capitalized using the wrong principal balance. This includes payments that should have been applied to principal when there should have been no interest balance due. All the details and calculations are inside of the attachments provided for each private student loan. 

By the time Navient took over the loan on XXXX XXXX XXXX the total principal balance across all 3 Private Student Loans was off by {$3800.00}. This can be referenced using the Interest Rate Calculated Using Incorrect Unpaid Principal Balance Comparison PDF files created from the downloaded CSV files from Navient.com. The breakdown of this is below. 

XXXX : {$2100.00} XXXX : {$1000.00} XXXX : {$650.00} Details for Issue 2 : The second issue starts at the point where Navient had taken over the loans from SallieMae. On XX/XX/XXXX, any and all late fees that were owed at that time were then reversed and no longer owed. This is shown as Late Fee Reversal on all 3 of my private student loans. This is on the scanned printout from XXXX dated XXXX along with the CSV download from XXXX. After this date, Navient applied payments on all 3 loans towards late fees that had been reversed. This directly impacted the principal balance owed because the payment made, was not applied to the principal balance, but to late fees that were at a zero balance. Interest was then calculated on a higher balance caused, not only by calculating interest on a wrong principal balance since the date of disbursement, but also by applying payments towards late fees, when they should have been going to principal. This can all be referenced in the Unowed Late Fees Paid and Extra Interest Paid Due to Misallocation of Payments PDF Files and the Scanned printout from Navient.com dated XXXX 

In addition to the noted above files, I have also attached a word document containing video links of me accessing my XXXX portal. Each time I would access the portal to download, print, or just view history on my private student loans, I would take a video of it to keep a timeline of what I was experiencing.","","Navient Solutions, LLC.","OH","440XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-23,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8209760,2024

I am writing to formally demand a refund pertaining to in my name with Navient. I have carefully reviewed the loan agreement and believe that I am entitled to a refund based on the following grounds : 1098-E : According to my records which I have reviewed all my tax documents which have been completed by a licensed accountant per IRS standards with over 30 years of experience. I obtained copies of tax returns submitted to the IRS along my originals to ensure any discrepancies that may have been submitted on my end which no discrepancies found. However multiple discrepancies that were found on Navient 's part. I requested copies of all 1098-E forms from Navient which I received XX/XX/XXXX. I was not provided copies of the 1098-Es. The amounts on the document from Navient pertaining to the loan in question are inaccurate which is of concern and validates my payments were processed to a loan that is not mine. 

I spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX who works in your consumer advocate department in reference to all the aboveXXXX XXXX also provided me an EIN that does not reflect the 1098-Es that I have and are not listed on the documents I obtained from the IRS. The EIN numbers on the 1098-Es all pertain to Federal Student loans. This is very concerning which validates that Navient listed this private loan under my federal loan account number and attached another account number to represent a private loan which would be beneficial for Navient upon tax filing.

Misrepresentation : I requested copies of all loan documents. I was provided documents that are concerning. I was provided two disclosures with different dates which I have questioned multiple times and not been provided an answer as to why the dates are different, a loan application that has a signature that is not mine along with no date. I was provided loan information that validates Navient consolidated a private and federal loan under the account number XXXX although uses XXXX and continued to accept payment. Interchanging loan numbers/account numbers/grouping has been an issue for many with Navient as mentioned in XXXX of the lawsuits. I expect Navient to rectify this by refunding the full loan amount, payments and interest. 
Transaction history varies from paper work I was provided in XX/XX/XXXX from the Navient website. Upon reviewing the Navient transaction list on the website a payment of {$1.00} is noted. A payment made that month was allocated to XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. Navient transferred loans to XXXX that also do not reflect correct amount. 

Navient has had multiple lawsuits pertaining to unfair, deceptive practice and violating consumer protection laws. 
XXXX of the lawsuits was filed by The Massachusetts Attorney General along with other state XXXX XXXX. The lawsuits filed was pertaining to Navient violated consumer protection laws by engaging in unfair and deceptive servicing and collection practices and, as XXXX XXXX, originating predatory subprime private student loans. 
Another lawsuit filed by the CFPB because Navient XXXX XXXX at Every Stage of Repayment. Navient, Formerly Part of XXXX XXXX, Illegally Cheated Borrowers Out of Repayment Rights Through Shortcuts and Deception The settlement included conduct reforms, including prohibitions on unfair and deceptive conduct and terms designed to ensure that Navient improves its servicing and debt collection operations which Navient has not done. 


I have attached copies of relevant documents, including payment records and correspondence with Navient, to support my claim. I have also made attempts to resolve this matter through your customer service department, but have not received a satisfactory response. 

I demand that Navient rectify this situation within 30 days. Rectification is to include a full refund with in the 30 days from the date on this letter in the form of a check and remove this trade line from my credit report. Navient is to inform XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX along XXXX any other CRA that Navient reports XXXX. 

Failure to address this matter satisfactorily I will take further legal. I trust that Navient will handle this matter with the utmost urgency and professionalism.

I spoke to a call center employee who was apparently putting me on hold and corresponding with a supervisor. My initial renewal date was XX/XX/2024, but I messaged them to let them know I didn't need to renew according to the FSA site https : XXXX ( """" When do I have to recertify my XXXX plan? '' ) where it says my renewal date will be pushed out a year. After some correspondence with the supervisor they said that my actual renewal date was XX/XX/2024, conveniently, a few days after the cutoff for pushing the renewal date out, which is XX/XX/2024. 
Additionally, """" XXXX '' page on the FSA site says """" On an income-driven repayment plan, you usually have to update your income every year ( recertification ). Because of the COVID-19 payment pause, you dont have to update us yet. '' So, according to the FSA, I also do not need to recertify yet. 
I fear that they are trying to mislead me into recertifying early, which I have read online is happening to a lot of people. 
It also seems like they're misleading me because they said my recertification is on XX/XX/2024. Which is 1 day after my next payment, and they already increased my payment amount from my IDR amount to the 10-year amount for my payment due on XX/XX/2024. That makes no sense, if my recertification date was XX/XX/2024, then my payment wouldn't change until after that. 
I have messaged them 3 times ( once on XX/XX/2024 and twice on XX/XX/2024 ), I had to call them, and they said a supervisor would call me back. I did this on XX/XX/2024, but they did not call me back. I will call again tomorrow.

2024-02-12,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","My Student Loan was initially a HEAL loan ( Health Education Assistance Loan ). It was initially managed by XXXX XXXX, now taken over by Navient. 

The Navient name and loan number are : XXXX XXXX XXXX Loan XXXX Loan type FFELP, initially HEAL I began repaying my loan in XXXX, after finishing my residency. In XXXX of XXXX, XXXX XXXX sent a document to me stating I could reduce my interest by a half percentage point by linking direct payments from my checking account to automatically pay the loan each month. Not trusting them from previous experience, I called and spoke to loan services two times prior to signing the direct deposit. I called to be assured that all this form was doing was allowing direct payment from my checking account on my existing loan, and that they would NOT call this a new disbursement and new loan, with a new 30 year payment schedule. I had already been paying on the loan for 15 years, and was finally at a point where I was paying some principal on it. I was assured, twice, that this was not the case. I signed the direct deposit form ( the only form I signed ), and they immediately issued a """" New Loan '' with a new 30 year schedule of payments that will last until XXXX. 

I would have completed my payment of the loan three years ago, if XXXX XXXX had not fraudulently """" signed '' my name ( a printed name not signed by me ), and """" issued '' a new loan. 

I initially borrowed {$36000.00} for tuition and books. I have, to date, paid payments totaling {$150000.00}, and still """" owe '' {$33000.00}. 
I have contacted Navient several times over the last five years. I was told I would need to file a """" Fraud and Identity Theft '' complaint with their internal fraud department. XXXX XXXX, in the years surrounding XXXX, when this happened to me, has been found guilty of falsely extending loans with practices such as what occurred to my account. 

I have written to the XXXX XXXX, and was told I would have to take care of it with Navient. Navient is unresponsive, and says they can't forgive the remaining balance of the loan. To be honest, at this point, I don't know who to turn to. 

When XXXX XXXX """" issued a new disbursement '' I demanded to see papers that showed I had """" asked for a new loan ''. I had simply signed a form to have the payments made automatically from my checking account. I never received any of their """" paperwork ''. 

I did, 5 years ago, find a somewhat sympathetic ear at Navient, and she was able to find the form I supposed signed for the new disbursement request. It simply had my name typed on it in the signature box. 

This is the heart of the matter with the current student loan situation. XXXX XXXX committed fraud, misrepresentation of information and documents, and identity theft in issuing a new loan that I not only did not request, but called them specifically to insure they would not call it a new disbursement. 

I would appreciate any help CFPB can provide in this situation. With the current """" loan balance '', I will be making payments into my late seventies, and will have paid on the loan for 45 years. I have already made payments of nearly 5 times the amount I borrowed, and the remaining balance remains close to the initial amount of my loans. 

Thank you for your consideration and help. Please let me know if there is any other information I can provide to you to help get relief from the remaining portion of the student loan.

2024-01-18,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Problem with customer service","I have been having a lot of issues and poor customer service since my loans have transferred to Mohela. One of the issues I have experienced is that my qualifying payments on my Direct Plus Graduate Loans remain inaccurate at 41 qualified payments, when they should be receiving at least 66 qualified payments, based on the forbearance/deferment history that Mohela provided to me during my call on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX My XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX have been correctly assessed, and I believe my Direct Plus Graduate Loans should have been updated at the same time. 

Additionally, when my loans were transferred to them because of participation in the PSLF program, my repayment plan did not transfer along with my loans, so I reapplied in XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted them and they offered to place my account in forbearance for as long as it needed to be until IDR took effect. I contacted them again in XXXX despite their lengthy hold times, to also request a prior servicer payment history, which they said they would send and that I would receive it within 30 business days. 

I called on XX/XX/XXXX for a status update again and was told the request for my payment history that was submitted was inaccurate, and would need to be resubmitted. 

I called again on XX/XX/XXXX after not receiving an update regarding my IDR or payment history request, and the Mohela representative I spoke with told me they would submit the IDR request again and to give it another 15 business days. 

When I called on XX/XX/XXXX for an unrelated reason and spoke with XXXX, I was told that my IDR request which I had submitted on XX/XX/XXXX had been placed on hold for the following reason : """" pending ability to disclose eligible loan. '' XXXX explained that there was a technical error processing the application, which is why I had been prompted to submit a new application. So I have been waiting since XX/XX/XXXX for Mohela to process an IDR application, which they had no intention of processing and they kept extending the forbearance, and potentially jeopardizing my qualifying payments under PSLF. 

On XXXXXXXX XXXX, I also inquired about my prior servicer payment history, which was supposed to show me all the payments I have made on my federal student loans. My payment history request was still processing as of XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Apparently, since the agent I had spoken to in XXXX had submitted the wrong request and a new one was submitted I would have to wait another 30 business days from that request. Considering that we are working on a deadline and each request takes 30 business days to process, maybe even longer depending on volume, this is unacceptable. 

Because of Mohela 's delays, poor training of their agents, and overall poor customer service, I am having a hard time making an informed decision about consolidation of my federal student loans for the purpose of PSLF. They keep pushing things around but never accomplishing things correctly, and are putting an unnecessary pressure on me as the XX/XX/XXXX deadline approaches. I refuse to blindly jump into a consolidation which could further delay my PSLF due to processing times, especially considering how many issues I've already had getting my IDR processed, because they have failed to provide me with the required information and update my account appropriately in a timely manner.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","PA","17110","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-18,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8180203,2024

After financing my education at a XXXX XXXX XXXX in Oregon through federal student loan programs, I found myself facing significant challenges with Navient. The ordeal began shortly after my Grace Period ended in XX/XX/XXXX. Despite my best efforts to submit income verification documents to Navient 's website, technical glitches persistently thwarted my attempts. What followed were interactions with their customer service representatives that only deepened my frustration and despair. 

For over a year, XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  XX/XX/XXXX, I found myself caught in a frustrating loop, repeatedly uploading required documents to a portal, receiving non-compliance notifications, and starting the process anew. During this time, Navient capitalized interest on my loans, resulting in an alarming six-figure interest capitalization that inflated my total student loan debt to an overwhelming $ XXXX. 

The breaking point came when Navient finally acknowledged that the portal they directed me to was defunct and unmonitored. The toll on my mental health was devastating. Enduring tearful phone calls and falling into a XXXX  XXXX and associated weight gain which my family and close friends can attest to. 

Now, as I navigate the process of consolidating my student loans to access Income-Driven Repayment benefits, I find myself facing the haunting repercussions of Navient 's actions.

1. Attached below will show that I paid off my loans in full multiple times, only to have each payment cancelled by EdFinancial without reason, just stating that there is some sort of issue. I contacted my bank and they said there was no reason as to why the payment should not have gone through. 
2. After 3 attempts to pay off my balance in full via their website, I called and made the payment over the phone with a customer service person who assured me that I paid the balance in full. A few weeks later, I check my account and see that there is roughly {$150.00} left over in the account that they did not tell me was unpaid, after I paid the full balance. I called customer support and showed them that I paid my entire balance in full, showing them that my balance was {$9900.00} and that was the amount I paid. The customer support person apologized to me, and said that the remaining ~ {$150.00} would be wiped from my account. Weeks go by and it does not get cleared. I call again and the lady on the phone gave me terrible service and fought with me until I did the math for her and showed that I paid off the entire balance of {$9900.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. After she gave me attitude for 30 min and spoke to her manager, she apologized and said I was right and that the balance would be cleared. It has now been multiple weeks and the balance remains, with no word from EdFinancial. During this time, it has been accruing interest. It is now XX/XX/XXXX, the balance is still there and it needs to be cleared. 
3.

Sincerely, Your Nelnet Customer Service Team I again called Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX, and was for the very first time able to speak to a represenative. I asked questions about how the payments made had been credited and how the crediting of those payments effected the continuous acount payments.

2024-02-21,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","I will try to be as concise as possible, there are several problems at play here that have also been reported to the XXXX XXXX XXXX : My student loans transfered from Great Lakes to Nelnet  in XXXX. I asked for a copy of all of my XXXX XXXX XXXX at that time so they wouldn't get lost and still have not received them. 

XXXX about my SAVE/IBR application : I XXXX my application for the XXXX plan on XX/XX/XXXX of last year. They said that while it was in progress, no payments were needed. I received XXXX similar emails titled, """" your application is in progress '' or """" your payments are postponed '' on XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. 
Any billing statement emails I got in the interim have had {$0.00} due. Including the email for my XX/XX/XXXX statement of this year. Not a single thing was mailed to me, they have my correct address. I can prove this with XXXX daily digest emails. 

I did miss a single email asking for my spouses paystub for my IDR application on XX/XX/XXXX, 4 days before XXXX and before my husband and I both got hit with the XXXX and XXXX, back to back. No follow-up email, no letter. I was confused because I didn't apply for XXXX, I applied for XXXX. I can't find their records of this on Nelnet 's website, but I do see it on the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX website. 

When I called earlier today I was told I missed my requalification period for XXXX. No addressing my XXXX application, that I repeatedly told them I applied for 4 months ago. 
Funny enough, they actually lost a suit in XXXX  and had to pay $ XXXX for failure to communicate to borrowers this exact situation. 


XXXX about repayments : Yesterday I received an email that my account was past due. Really odd, because I didn't receive an email with either a XXXX or XXXX statement saying that something was due. Didn't concern me at the time because the statement emails were sporadic and always said {$0.00} while my loans were in administrative forbearance. Again, no physical mail, which I have government record on. 
All of a sudden I have a statement balance of {$740.00}, half of which is past due. They said they sent a letter on XX/XX/XXXX. Its been a week, I have not yet received it. 
Instead of being any level of helpful on the call they tried to pressure me to set-up payment on the phone. 

XXXX. Auto-payment : When I called to ask about my application they looked up my account activity and said I had canceled my auto-pay in XXXX. That was funny, because I haven't logged in since XXXX and I never set up auto-pay with them specifically because I don't trust them. 
This is anecdotal, but there are dozens of threads on r/StudentLoans talking about how Nelnet has XXXX payments and then said there was no payment made, or pulled payment if you have an ACH saved, but don't have autopay set up, or flat out, don't pull autopay and hit you with late fees. 

All of this is to say. Nelnet is engaging in multiple downright criminal activities, some of which they have already been sued for, on XXXX of the largest and most financially vulnerable population of borrowers in this country. I am afraid I have no recourse, I wouldn't even know how to go about switching servicers and I am deathly afraid this will be my life forever. I graduated 12 years ago and the balance of my student loans has actually increased due to capitalized interest. This is not how Student Loans were explained to me when I signed that paperwork at XXXX. It is a constant living nightmare.","","Nelnet, Inc.","FL","33714","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-21,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8392333,2024

I made the payment on XXXX through the nelnet secure site. I have screenshots and bank statements showing paid in full. Payment deducted from my account shows dept of education not Nelnet on XXXX, however I received the payment in full letter from nelnet, i have the screenshot to show i paid it and confirmation received from Nelnet. I received another letter from Nelnet statement date XXXX showing I still owe the amount paid with more interest accrued. I called them tonight XXXX to confirm and speaking with the representative they are confirming they do not see that I made a payment. We confirmed its the account ending in XXXX. I have the letter from Nelnet, the screenshots from the Nelnet site Secure.Nelnet.com total payment amount and payment date and my bank statement to confirm it was paid.

So here we are with the representative coming back on the line after i have been on hold because they are short staffed of supervisors- of course that's corporate A for you. So I asked if I am holding with her waiting on a supervisor or waiting for them to conduct the research. Because its clear at this time they can not get a supervisor to assist. We have to wait on the line for them for XXXX min already. Then I got even more upset as they are trying to search and see that on XXXX after i received my paid in full letter that it was a 'batch reversal ' yet I haven't received any credit of the funds, so where is the batch reversal going if not returning back to me? The math is now mathing that they did a batch reversal on XXXX and I received this email showing i still owed the funds.

Despite making all my payments in advance and on time, I have noticed that my most recent payment, made on XX/XX/XXXX for the amount of {$170.00} has not been applied correctly and accurately. 

I have taken proactive steps to resolve this issue by contacting your customer service department on multiple occasions and sending emails outlining my situation. I've called XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. I have followed all protocols and waiting time. Unfortunately, despite my efforts, I have not received any resolution or assistance. I was even escalated to a supervisor who was unable to provide a satisfactory solution.

Moreover, I have experienced considerable frustration as each time I have called, I have been placed on hold for over an hour. In total, I have made five calls regarding this matter, and the due date of my next payment, which is XX/XX/XXXX, is fast approaching. The correct application of this payment is crucial as it will affect my due date. 

I kindly request your immediate attention and assistance in rectifying this issue. I believe that open communication and prompt resolution are essential in maintaining a positive customer-provider relationship. I trust that you will take the necessary steps to ensure that my payment is applied correctly, and I receive the necessary confirmation. 

Please reach out to me at your earliest convenience to provide an update on the status of this matter and to discuss the steps required to resolve it. I appreciate your prompt attention to this urgent issue. 

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

It seemed to go up quite a bit from the previous month. When Navient called me to collect I asked the rep why has the monthly bill gone up so much from my previous bill, I was told it was due to some federal loans coming out of forbearance. That was puzzling because I get monthly statements from XXXX who processes my federal loans now, and that I haven't been on forbearance since before XXXX. I went back to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and had in school deferment, or so I thought, but was told some loans were in forbearance and that they were collecting dues from both private and federal loans. 
I said I had no problem paying on the private loans, but that I won't be paying anything on federal loans until I get an explanation as to why they are trying to collect payments on them.

It also seems pointless considering nothing transpired from any of these phone calls. 

I called them in XXXX or XXXX to try to lower my monthly payment by applying for an income driven repayment plan ( IDR ). Payments were {$270.00} then I got an email in XXXX / XXXX saying congratulations and that my IDR went through and now my payments are {$110.00}. But when I log in to my portal, it says my payments are still {$270.00}. I called and was on the phone with them for about twenty minutes and then they disconnected ( probably accidently but incredibly annoying to me ). She said that she had no record of that email saying I was approved for lower payments. I literally had the email open in front of me and asked her if I could send it to her as """" proof. '' She said she can't receive emails. The reps have no record of the emails their company sent to me. 

I called again ten days later but couldn't talk to a live person. However, their automated system said, """" Congratulations. Your income driven repayment plan has been accepted. Log in to your portal to read the most updated information. '' Every time I call them, I get that automated message after I type in the last XXXX digits of my social security number. 
I called again about a week later and it's the same situation where I can't talk to a real person because they're always experiencing """" higher than normal call volume. '' I called again on XX/XX/XXXX. This lady seemed to know what she was doing ( unlike the previous woman I talked to ). She said I'm not approved for the IDR based on some of the types of loans I have and she has no record of that email saying otherwise. But she was willing to help me get a lower payment via another program called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I think. Now she tells me my new monthly payment is {$94.00}. That pleased me. I said thank you very much to her and we hung up. The online portal has no record of this new payment plan and it still says I owe {$270.00}. Even after refreshing the website and trying a different day, it's the same old thing. 

I called again today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and spoke with someone whose name sounds like XXXX XXXX. She said that the previous rep miscommunicated. XXXX said only half of my loans are eligible for the XXXX XXXX XXXX program and that would be {$80.00} but the total monthly payment would be {$170.00}. I asked her when this would take effect and she said that she would have it expedited to two to four days. 

In XXXX of 2024 they said on the phone my payments were {$110.00} but online it says my payments are {$270.00}. 
I called on the XXXX and XXXX XXXX 2024 but they weren't available to take calls.

I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and that lady said my new payments were now {$94.00} using XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

I am set up for monthly payments of about XXXX XXXX  and have been on that plan for many years. I am enrolled in autodebit for this amount. 

The Nelnet website now inexplicably indicates that my new monthly payment is more than {$9100.00}. This is approximately my full balance. Nothing changed for them to change my monthly payment.

My options are to either cancel autopay, which will result in a higher interest rate, or pay my bank for a stop payment, which will cost me {$35.00} and likely create problems for my actual, correct payments that I want and need to make. 

Nelnet has no apparent interest in resolving my issue despite repeated and lengthy attempts to reach them. They need to be held accountable.

2024-02-03,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","Ed Financial has been my student loan servicer for several years and I have had an online account with them for several years. Due to data limitations, the ED Financial website is unable to provide account history more than 12 months old ( which is absurd ) so I can not determine exactly when Ed Financial became my student loan servicer, but it was several years ago. 

Back in XX/XX/2023, I went to login to Ed Financial to confirm that my prior autopay information was up to date and discovered that I could not login, and also could not reset my password. Ed Financial 's website contains information on how to establish a new account, but this is targeted on the website for new borrowers or debtors who do not already have an Ed Financial account. As someone with an existing account and login, I did not believe that I needed to establish a new account ( since this would be totally redundant and nonsensical ). Although my browser and cell phone have retaineda saved login username and password ( which is evidence that I already have an established online account already ).

To fix this, I reached out to Ed Financial for assistance in accessing my account. I called them and had to wait XXXX hours on hold, before the phone line would be unilaterally disconnected. I requested a call back through the automated system that would save my place in line on XXXX separate days, and did not receive a single call back. Being desperate, on XX/XX/XXXX, I sent an email to them requesting a call back and specifically informed Ed Financial that my attempts to call them did not work because of the long hold times that result in disconnection, the failed attempts at receiving a call back, and my inability to login to be able to send them a message directly. I asked them in all capital letters to PLEASE CALL ME- and what did they do? On XX/XX/XXXX, they sent me a response in my online account without even attempting to contact me in any other manner, despite me telling them that I need their assistance logging in.Note that it took Ed Financial 6 weeks to respond to my message.

Without being able to reset my password, I was completely unable to contact Ed Financial through the student borrower portal, or through telephonic means.

Finally, on a total whim, I decided to """" create an account '' ( despite already having had one for years ), and was able to login. When I logged in, I was SHOCKED to discover I was past due. During this time, I received email notices that I had messages available on the ED Financial inbox but due to my inability to login, I could not access my account or any of the messages. Once I was able to self-solution my login problem, I immediately made a payment and believed that my autopay would resume the following month ( I always pay my student loans on autopay and had no reason to think that Ed Financial would cancel my standing autopay instructions without communicating with me ). 

Note : I know they deleted my prior login information because I re-established my login using the same login credentials ( email and password ) that I previously used. 

Fast forward to the following month : the autopay that I previously established was no longer on my account and my payments that I expected to be made were not withdrawn by Ed Financial, as previously directed and authorized. I have since made payments to catch up, but now my perfect repayment history ( of almost 13 years ) has been damaged.

I am extremely upset and angry that what should be basic loan servicing functions are impossible with Ed Financial. It is completely counterintuitive that I would need to create a """" new '' account to login to my existing account, and I did not receive ANY communication that informed me that Ed Financial canceled my autopay instructions.

It is completely unfair that there are this many roadblocks to make a payment. To be clear - I want to repay my student loans.

The information available on the website about creating an account does not say """" If you previously had an account, you will still need to establish new credentials. '' The information also did not tell me that they cancelled my autopay instructions when they moved to a new servicing system. These errors in basic communication, as well as the complete madness of continuing to contact me through the website inbox despite my telling ED Financial that I can not access the website and requesting a call back, has led me to miss payments and caused extreme stress.

Ironically, the reason I reached out to Ed Financial to begin with is that I thought that my student loan repayments were miscalculated and failed to include my spouse 's student loans ( which are serviced by XXXX ). I have not had the emotional and logistical time capacity to deal with this, because the thought of attempting to contact Ed Financial is so discouraging.

I understand that many millions of people have student loan repayment resume, but that is why clear communication to borrowers is so critical.

If Ed Financial sent me a letter or email ( not a message in the portal ) saying """" Your previous login credentials have been deleted, you need to create a new one. Your prior autopay instructions have also been deleted, you need to re-established reoccurring periodic transactions. '' I could have avoided all this.

If Ed Financial maintained an effective way to communicate with them via phone by having reasonable wait times and abiding by the call back instructions they provided, I could have avoided this.

If Ed Financial was responsive ( such as by communication in a channel other than the portal or having reasonable wait times or actually calling me back ) then I could have avoided this.

With respect to the question- have you contacted your servicer about this issue- of course not! This is the exact nature of my complaint- the inability to contact Ed Financial.","","EdFinancial Services","MI","48105","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-03,"Untimely response","No","N/A",8277511,2024

I am writing to request your intervention in addressing this matter and ensuring a prompt resolution. The misclassification of the form as a duplicate has negatively impacted my PSLF application, raising concerns about my eligibility and payment count. If reviewed correctly, my payment count will be XXXX of XXXX, which will help me to have XXXX of my XXXX loans forgiven. 

I was initially advised 30 days, then advised 60 days and now it is apparently 90 days. There has not been any representative who has been able to rectify the issue. 

I need MOHELA to review and rework my PSLF form for my previous employer, SSA covering eligible periods of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. Several of my previous messages have gone unaddressed and unanswered. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I messaged them, waited on hold, sent them the confirmation of the approval in XXXX and then even reapplied for the SAVE plan AGAIN. No responses.

They also send back """" correspondence processing delay '' notices, that ultimately say it may take them up to 90 days to answer. A company should not be able to charge interest, increase payments, ignore applications, reverse applications with no explanation, and then tell customers to wait up to 90 days to get a response. Interest accumulates, my credit score is being impacted and there is no way possible for me to make these payments. I struggled paying {$1000.00}, but I made it a priority and did it, so I was in no way in default. The company randomly changes terms and then refuses to help customers. It's so unethical and frustrating and I know I am not alone. I'm also 17 payments away from loan forgiveness under PSLF, so it feels like this is intentionally disrupting that and making it impossible to keep working toward this forgiveness.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","NY","138XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-17,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8164924,2024

It was then processed by studentaid.gov in 2 weeks and sent over to MOHELA for processing.

Since that time I have been removed from the SAVE plan, my selected payment plan ( which was in effect throughout the payment pause ) the repaye plan, and placed on the level plan. This was done without my knowledge or consent and without my IDR being calculated. I have contacted mohela multiple times to inquire why I was placed on the level plan and not kept on the repaye plan, so that I would have a repayment amount that would be affordable. All of the representatives I spoke to confirm that I was on the repay plan, and they were not aware of why I was taken off of this payment plan and placed on the level plan. None of the people I have spoken to, which include a supervisor were able to answer my questions. They were not able to give me an accurate timeline for when my IDR would be calculated. I have received multiple letters from Mohela with conflicting information and new processing dates.It has been almost 6 months and now I received a bill stating that I will have to pay over {$5000.00} a month starting XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX 
I explained to the supervisor that I spoke with that {$5000.00} was outside of my ability to repay, and I requested that my IDR calculation would be fast tracked and that my account be placed into administrative forbearance. She stated that she was not able to do either. I inquired why I was not placed in administrative forbearance, as it was MOHELAs responsibility to calculate my IDR within the timeline that they said, for, after it was submitted to them by studentaid.gov. She was not able to answer that question. 

Im currently on the public service loan forgiveness program ( PSLF ) And these months that I have not been able to pay, do not count towards my public service loan forgiveness payment counts. MOHELA is refusing to place me on administrative forbearance while they calculate my repayment amount under the safe plan that I applied for. I have lost six months worth of payments, and now my public service loan forgiveness timeline has been pushed back six months.

This program requires income recertification yearly. This recertification was put on pause during the pandemic along with the monthly payment, which had been in forbearance. Beginning XX/XX/XXXX, the payment pause ended and the stipulation that income recertification would restart XX/XX/XXXX unless your assigned recertification date fell prior to XX/XX/XXXX. People with recertification dates prior to XX/XX/XXXX would have their date extended by 1 year. 

For example, my recertification date was XX/XX/XXXX. This date is prior to XX/XX/XXXX and therefore per the FSA website the date should be extended to XX/XX/XXXX. 

The loan company MOHELA was contacted on XX/XX/XXXX and agreed the date should be extended to XXXX. The MOHELA representative stated this would be corrected in 2-3 days. It was not. MOHELA was recontacted on XX/XX/XXXX, they again agreed the date should be extended to XXXX but reported this takes XXXX business days. The date was not changed. MOHELA was again contacted on XX/XX/XXXX at which time the MOHELA representative reported MOHELA was unable to change dates and reported the Federal Student Aid office would have to change the date.

1. Some phone numbers listed on the contact us aren't even correct : XXXX - what even is this? Why was a woman trying to tell me I qualified for a device in case I fell and needed help? I hung up. ( And yes I triple checked to be sure I dialed the correct numbers ). 

2. Once you find the correct number to call, you are forced to listen to an obnoxiously long automated voice without ever giving an option of speaking to a representative. You have to select a number that doesn't apply to you, just to listen to more nonsense, before suddenly being transferred. The wait time is ASTRONOMICAL. 

3. THE INFORMATION IS DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHO YOU SPEAK TO. I do not need to explain how wrong that is. 

4. Most people are in training, and no one who can actually help is ever available. I was on hold for over 40 mins and had to hang up before I got to speak to the """" senior representative '' who was going to talk to me about forbearance while await PSLF to go through. No one has time to be on hold for that long, especially without the option of a call back. 

5.

6. It takes way to long for someone to respond to a message- about a full month or longer in some cases. 

7. No one is reaching out to customers to share one time account adjustment info. If you happen to suffer through calling Mohela and actually getting to speak to a minimally competent representative, ( and if you're lucky - like I was ) you may be told that your remaining loans that you were always told weren't eligible for PSLF ( or they would be but would start back at XXXX ), actually are now if they're consolidated.

I linked my tax information, I filled out the application and I followed up with Nelnet to confirm I was set. They said yes. Then they inform me my payments will be over {$500.00} because my application was completed so I did it again. I waited and checked again to find it still was {$500.00}. I called and they said I need to fill out the application again. So I did. I explained I couldnt afford {$500.00} each month and they said we can set it to I think {$250.00} and I agreed. They then apparently put me on forbearance while they fixed the issue and put me on the SAVE plan. For two months my payments were {$5.00} and then I had a payment of {$210.00} so I thought they fixed it. I discovered this week they pulled {$710.00} out of my account. Theyre saying its because I was on forbearance and that not all my loans were consolidated so I didnt have all loans on SAVE plan. I had to pay my bank {$30.00} to cancel the payment and now my student loan account shows Im {$1400.00} past due. I called again today and they said itll take 30-60 days for this to be resolved. So I asked if theyd then be taking another {$700.00} out of my account and they informed me that the only way to prevent it is to go on forbearance again. This is affecting my physical well-being, mental and financial. I have done everything in my power to set this right and Im getting penalized. I tried speaking to a supervisor but they told me Id have to wait on hold for an hour. I have no control of this situation and Im doing all I can to make things right.

However, my private student loans with Navient weren't included on the list of those that were being forgiven. Instead, my student loans were charged off in XX/XX/XXXX without my knowledge. I wasn't sent a letter of warning or final action etc. I thought that my loans were in Forbearance like other federal and private loans. I contacted Navient in XXXX to start a repayment program. I was misled into believing that if I make XXXX payments the rest of my balance would be forgiven. This so-called agreement was not in writing, just over the phone. I took a chance that the representative was telling the truth. I made a payment in XXXX after asking for and being denied over the phone, for a forbearance, deferment, or XXXX related forgiveness. I currently have many ongoing XXXX issues and was contemplating on retiring early under a XXXX retirement. I asked for applications to each program, I couldn't find any applications online, and was told that they would be mailed to me. They never were. I contacted Navient in late XXXX, early XXXX, to learn more about the program only to find out that the program was not a forgiveness program. I informed that I never receive any applications in the mail and that I would need more information before any more payment would be made. I became sicker and was focusing more on my health than Navient 's lack of communication. I ended up in the hospital for over a week then back in the hospital a week later. I didn't know that Navient closed my student loans until I applied for a line of credit. I was just informed this month that I had been charged off 6 months ago. 

Navient failed to send me any notification for years about my student loans. They did not send any statements to me although I would update my address online. I set up auto bill payments and established first contact with the service. I even set up my email to receive statements or communication from the service. On XX/XX/XXXX, after the charge off, I received an email stating that they were updated my address after I contacted them to again ask for a deferment. I was not informed while talking to the representative that my loans were charged off. 

Navient failed me notify me of any action they took. Navient did everything they could to make sure I would fail at paying off my student loans.","","Navient Solutions, LLC.","PA","19020","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-27,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8433562,2024

The facts are simple. The loan was sent there erroneously since I was not actually behind on payment by XXXX or XXXX months like the loan servicer ECSI contents. Thats not even possible considering the loan only became due in XX/XX/XXXX. Furthermore, I only learned of the loans existence in XX/XX/XXXX.

Obviously, now I see this wasnt the case. 

At first when I was getting threatening correspondence from Heartland ECSI, I thought it was in error. But it turns out the majority of the loans associated with my undergraduate degree are indeed in deferment because XXXX made the process easy. My ECSI-held University Loan was the exception. Which is confusing because all of my loans were serviced by Heartland ECSI at XXXX point. Additionally, in regards to Heartland ECSI, I filled out a forebearance on XX/XX/XXXX only to be told the next day that I still had to pay hundreds of dollars worth of interestsomething they really shouldve mentioned beforehand. Then to make matters worse, every subsequent email from ECSI said I had until XX/XX/XXXX to complete my forebearance by paying the outstanding interest and yet, XXXX XXXX sent my account to collections on the XXXX!

My then-servicer, XXXX, accepted timely payments in excess of my monthly bill from me from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, under the impression that they were making progress toward XXXX. I was never informed that these payments were not being considered qualifying- they were in full, timely, and my work certification forms were submitted and accepted by XXXX. A year later, I looked back and saw they were deemed """" ineligible, '' because I was on long-term deferment. XXXX ( of course ) never informed me that payments were not """" due, '' or that they were not considering them qualifying for XXXX. 

I complained several times to XXXX, to no avail. 

2 ) Later, after XXXX deigned to begin accepting my payments as qualifying for XXXX, after multiple years of steady employment, on-time payments in full, and accepted employer certification forms - a clear pattern of work toward XXXX XXXX XXXX  arbitrarily put my loan status on """" forbearance '' for three random months : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. My financial status had not changed at all, my XXXX and employment had not changed at all. I was never aware that they were making the change, or given a reason. I don't recall being notified. The forbearances just showed up late- but OF COURSE they accepted the payments I made assuming that nothing had changed. I complained several times to XXXX, and they did nothing. 

3 ) Then, XXXX 's contract was not renewed/they gave it up ( I'm unsure ), and a new monster took over as my loan servicer around the start of XXXX. I imagine CFPB has heard about MOHELA hundreds of times. MOHELA simply accepted the record provided them by XXXX with the XXXX incorrect payment categorizations ( XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ). The XXXX XXXX had implemented XXXX, and MOHELA said in XXXX that they would conduct a review to fix exactly the sort of problems that I was encountering. According to a phone call with them on XX/XX/XXXX of this year- that process STILL HAS NOT OCCURRED. 

XXXX ) Most recently, as I am a mere XXXX payments away from XXXX, MOHELA just arbitrarily placed my loans on """" Administrative Forbearance. '' I didn't EVEN GET A NOTICE!!! I happened to check my status count because I am so desperate to get these XXXX student loans off my back it is fraying my sanity. They never gave me a reason. I asked for one in online messages to them 3 times in XX/XX/XXXX. I asked in a phone call on XX/XX/XXXX. None has EVER BEEN GIVEN. On that phone call, I demanded that they remove the forbearance so I could get my XXXX loan payment credited.

2024-01-16,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Incorrect information on your report","Account status incorrect","THIS IS NOT A DUPLICATE COMPLAINT This is regarding Nelnet and their alleged, questionable tactics of servicing. I initiated a student loan consolidation from Nelnet to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I have kept in contact throughout this process with both servicers to ensure a smooth transition. I logged in to my Nelnet account and it showed that the payoff was received XX/XX/XXXX ; and XX/XX/XXXX, respectively. However, after further review, I had a principle balance of XXXX cents ; which insinuates to me that the payment was shorted in this amount. I called Nelnet and I attempted to pay the XXXX cents balance with my debit card and the representative was unable to process it. She emailed her supervisor and was told by this supervisor that it would take 60-90 days for the closing process ; then was told by the end of this month ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I asked the rep which is it, as I need a definitive date. The supervisor then told her the end of this month. The representative could not tell me why a balance of XXXX cents was left on my account. So I then asked for them to close it out immediately, as this is still showing on my credit report. I asked to speak to their Ombudsman, but was given the phone number to their state Ombudsman and not the financial aid Ombudsman. I believe that Nelnet is purposely and fraudulently attempting to keep my account open, after it has received its payoff from the new servicer ( XXXX ) ; and ruining my credit utilization by not reporting """" PAID AND CLOSED ''. Additionally, for them to tell me that it would take another 60-90 days to process this closure is unacceptable. After being given the incorrect information on contacting the financial aid Ombudsman, I called Nelnet back and processed the XXXX cents payment through their automated system. I have attached documentation from my account dashboard showing a XXXX ( {$0.00} ) balance ; and the dates of payments made. A further investigation needs to take place regarding Nelnet and their practices. I have attached all documentation including Identity verification documents.

I still made payments for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, however Nelnet did not correctly apply my payments towards interest and principle despite choosing a general account payment as opposed to a specific group payment. Nelnet applied very little payment to the interest, and allowed {$420.00} do accrue by XX/XX/XXXX, when I made my XXXX payment to try and pay that interest off. However, again, Nelnet applied only {$33.00} of the {$500.00} dollar payment to the interest allow more to accrue. I will include screenshots of the information. When I called them, after XXXX and XXXX hangup that caused me to have restart the process again I got contradicting stories about why this was happening. The first Customer Agent didn't know why the payments were not being applied correctly and when she tried to transfer me to more specialized support, I got hung up on. After a second call, I found out that on their end ( according to them ) the payments were only applied to specific loan groups, meaning it was not a general payment. However I never picked the per group option, so this is either an error on how the website works, or it's a behavior they don't explain. The agent stated they'll submit a technical report and after much explanation she will ask that the payment be reapplied correctly towards interest first. There is no guarantee that they will follow through as they have shown no consistency in handling this case, and based on a cursory look on XXXX, this is an ongoing problem with Nelnet and their website.","","Nelnet, Inc.","MI","48197","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-17,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8160459,2024

2024-01-08,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I was one of many borrowers getting ready to address the payback period of the post covid student loan relief period. During my conversations with my servicer, Edfinancial Services. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a general forbearance request online. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called in to check the status of it, since I was told this could take some time. During the XXXX call, the representative I spoke with educated me about the XXXX transition period. During that conversation, it was discussed that I would be wasting my general forbearance time, when the XXXX transition period is available to me, I could leverage that period until XX/XX/XXXX, and then apply for a general forbearance if need be. It was during that call that I made the request to go ahead and cancel my general forbearance request and leverage instead the XXXX transition period, which I did not need to apply for and would be automatically applied to my account. 

The problem came into play when I come to find out XX/XX/XXXX that my account still went into a general forbearance instead of the XXXX transition period that I discussed and verbally spoke to the prior representative I wanted to take advantage of. I called Edfinancial Services on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire what happened. The representative informed me that I was in fact on a general forbearance and that the request to cancel it was still in process. This request to cancel my general forbearance was made XX/XX/XXXX and to date, still has not been processed, 76 days ago... 

During that timeframe, the forbearance request I had submitted online on XX/XX/XXXX, that was supposed to have been canceled so I could take advantage of the XXXX program, was actually approved without my knowledge on XX/XX/XXXX, a total of 74 days. The impact to me are that : - The program I was supposed to be placed on, the XXXX Transition Period, never occurred per the conversation I had with my student loan servicer, something they confirmed would occur ; - The general forbearance I canceled in order to save that time, per my discussion with a rep from my student loan servicer, was in fact not canceled and still approved 40 days later after my call to cancel the request, and as a result, I am wasting general forbearance time that I should not have had to use due to the actions of my servicer.","","EdFinancial Services","TX","78613","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-08,"Untimely response","No","N/A",8126764,2024
2024-01-08,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I am writing to file a formal complaint against EdFinancial, the servicer of my student loans, regarding an issue with the terms of the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act ( SAVE ) plan, under which my loans are currently enrolled. 

According to the terms of the SAVE plan, enrolled loans are supposed to benefit from a low monthly payment, and importantly, interest does not accrue during the repayment period. However, despite these clear terms, my loan statements from EdFinancial continue to show interest accruing each month. This is in direct violation of the XXXX plan 's stipulations and is impacting my financial situation unfairly. 

I have attempted to resolve this issue directly with EdFinancial but have not received a satisfactory response. Therefore, I am seeking the assistance of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in this matter. I was told on XX/XX/XXXX that interest would be waived 'periodically ' but they could not provide any exact time frame. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that interest would be waived when my loans are forgiven in 20-25 years- which is not correct based on the SAVE plan. I have been enrolled in the SAVE plan since before payments and interest resumed. 

Please find attached copies of my loan statements and any relevant correspondence with the loan servicer. I would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and any assistance you can provide in rectifying this situation. 

The screenshots from my conversation on XX/XX/XXXX are labeled 1:3 1 and 1:3 2 and the conversation on XX/XX/XXXX is labeled 1:8 1, 1:8 2, 1:8 3.

In XXXX, my payment was again several XXXX dollars above the XXXX payment. Only at the beginning of XXXX did my monthly payment finally correct to XXXX and lower to the correct amount. 

Because I didn't pay XXXX, XXXX, nor XXXX 's payments because they were all incorrect, interest has now accrued on totals that I would have lowered had EdFinancial promptly applied my XXXX application to my EdFinancial account and loans.","","EdFinancial Services","OH","43054","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-05,"In progress","Yes","N/A",8110858,2024

They have been withdrawing the money every month ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX so far ), but are not applying those payments to my account. They continue to send me late payment notices but the money is leaving my checking account. 

I have tried to escalate this with management at Ed Financial, but the only action they have taken to date is to cancel my auto pay. Now my Ed Financial statement shows that I am nearly {$1800.00} overdue in spite of auto pay taking that money out of my bank account.

I have shared with them twice now, bank statements proving the withdrawal on the same date each month, but Ed Financial continues to pass me from agent to agent with absolutely no resolution in sight. I will consider legal action in this matter if I can't get an amicable resolution as I am currently being defrauded by this servicer. 

I am attaching images of my accounts and billing statements. In the statement from Ed Financial you can clearly see that I was enrolled in Auto Pay until this week. This was Ed Financial removing me from auto pay, but not correcting their error.

I first submitted my application to update my income-driven repayment plan to SAVE on XX/XX/XXXX. To my confusion, there's nowhere in the application to explicitly choose the SAVE plan. However, I clicked """" please choose the cheapest plan ''. I called Nelnet multiple times to ensure I'd be placed on the SAVE plan and was always left on hold for hours. Since I am a student with responsibilities, I couldn't wait on hold each time. The final time I finally got in contact with Nelnet, I had been on hold for over 4 hours. However, they did confirm they would switch me to the SAVE plan. My application was finally processed on XX/XX/XXXX ( almost 2 months after submission ). I was approved for an updated IDR plan, but much to my dismay it was NOT the SAVE plan. 

I re-applied to change my IDR plan to SAVE on XX/XX/XXXX. Once again, there was no option to click specifically for the SAVE plan and I had to leave it up to Nelnet. I called and waited on hold for hours again, and was again promised I'd be put on the SAVE plan. They also mentioned lower error rates with paper applications, and sent one in the mail. I received ( but never submitted ) the paper application- this paper application ALSO did not have an option to specifically request the SAVE plan. I was re-approved for an updated IDR on XX/XX/XXXX and was AGAIN devasted to see that I am still not on the SAVE plan. 

I feel HOPELESS. My current monthly interest expense is around {$1200.00}, which would be forgiven under the SAVE plan due to my income ( {$0.00} income as a student ). This interest expense will only continue to grow as interest accrues, both from taking out more debt to complete my degree and the compounding interest effect. The current expense is already {$1200.00} - more than many families pay for rent every month. An absurd amount that it being added to my debt every single month that Nelnet avoids their responsibility of putting me on the SAVE plan.

- I have recently applied for and been approved for the SAVE program, but the MOHELA website does not reflect this change.

- The MOHELA website is displaying conflicting information regarding my payment amount.

2024-01-04,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I have 5 loan groups under NelNet corresponding with 5 loans I had taken out for various semesters of school. I activated auto debit on my student loan account to pull a total amount of ~ {$270.00} from my checking account to be applied to the 5 separate loans for the amount due for each loan group every month. 
On XX/XX/XXXX an autodebit for ~ {$270.00} was pulled from my checking account. This was supposed to be applied to the amount due for each loan group. 
The payment was pulled for the correct amount but was only applied to 1 loan group. The other 4 loan groups reported that a payment was made on XX/XX/XXXX but no payment was actually applied and interest continued to accrue between the last payment that was processed on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX : when my monthly payment was due. The 4 loan groups were reported as current and paid however no payment was applied, no interest or principle was reduced, and my due date was moved to XX/XX/XXXX as if I had made my XX/XX/XXXX payment. The 1 loan group that had the full {$270.00} payment applied had most of the payment go to principle and pushed my due date for that loan forward into XXXX of XXXX. I called NelNet on XX/XX/XXXX who reported that they submitted a ticket to have the payment amounts corrected and to have all future payments corrected should the ticket be processed after my XX/XX/XXXX payment. 
By XX/XX/XXXX the payment was still not corrected and a second call was placed. The representative reported that the ticket was still in progress and could take up to 6 weeks to be completed. During this time interest was accruing on the 4 loans groups that had an erroneously reported payment for XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XXXX I made a payment of {$75.00} to pay down the interest that had accrued on the 4 loan groups that were not paid on XX/XX/XXXX. This was interested that should have been paid with the XX/XX/XXXX payment. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I made my monthly payment to each loan group manually but had I not paid extra interest in XX/XX/XXXX my entire payment on XX/XX/XXXX would have only gone to interest that was left unpaid on XX/XX/XXXX. 


As of writing this complaint, there has been no update from NelNet on the status of my ticket, they have no corrected my payment at all, and I have paid about {$75.00} in extra interest that accrued on my loans due to NelNet reporting a payment being made that was never applied.","","Nelnet, Inc.","NY","119XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8101284,2024

I applied for SAVE plan and was approved. It shows I am on the SAVE plan for all of my student loans. My monthly payment is now {$0.00}. However, I am still accruing interest on my student loans. This interest amount was around {$1000.00} last month, and now {$2400.00} this month, which is not correct according to the SAVE plan. I called Nelnet. The Nelnet """" advisor '' on the phone said that Nelnet doesn't decide if my interest plan is forgiven or when it is forgiven, the government does. However, according to the SAVE plan, which the Nelnet website states I am on, my interest should be a much lesser amount. The person over the phone said I just need to get the interest below {$2000.00} but I don't need to pay the full interest before it starts to go to principal. This does not make any sense to me. She said she did not know the exact amount of money I would have to pay in order for it to start going to interest, but it didn't have to be the full interest balance and kept saying it just needs to be below {$2000.00}. I asked if that meant I got my interest down to {$1900.00} then would any other payments go to principal since that's what she was telling me. She hung up on me! Nelnet also has no way to provide feedback on the call since in order to do so I was supposed to stay on the call, but she hung up. The call was less than 10minutes, some of which was taken up by me confirming my information. I have no way of paying my full interest, which is supposed to be lower according to SAVE, and I want to begin paying my principal with what little I have. I have no way to get information from SAVE about student loan interest forgiveness and mine keeps accruing. 
I have no way of complaining to Nelnet. They actively discourage you from emailing them, the email form requires several clicks to get to on their contact form, and they say their email volume is high.

However, despite waiting for a significant period, I received no communication from Nelnet about whether my application was approved, required additional information, or was even being processed. 

To my surprise and concern, I later discovered that my student loan account had been transferred to another loan servicing agency ( PHEAA ) without any prior notice or explanation from Nelnet. I was not informed of this transfer, nor was I provided with any details regarding the new agency, how to contact them, or how this would affect my income-driven repayment plan application. 

This lack of communication and transparency has left me in a state of confusion and concern about the status of my loan and repayment plan. I am uncertain about whom to contact regarding my application, and I am worried that this transfer might have affected the processing or approval of my income-driven repayment plan. 

I believe that as a borrower, I am entitled to clear and timely communication about significant changes to my loan servicing and the status of my repayment plan application. The absence of this essential information has caused unnecessary stress and uncertainty. I request that this matter be looked into promptly and that I be provided with comprehensive information regarding the status of my income-driven repayment plan application and the details of my new loan servicer.

My account to date still looks like I just took the loans when i refinanced. My loans have grown over the years despite paying them for a majority of the 25 years I've held them. When I took forbearance in the past it was due to financial difficulty and the minimum payments being beyond what I can afford. 

Now I am years away from retirement, Aidvantage, despite a previous complaint filed here In XX/XX/XXXX - Complaint # XXXX - which they responded to with more detail then they have EVER responded to me ( they make it IMPOSSIBLE to contact them ), still doesn't care that I have been paying for decades and is prepared to take payments from me like my loans are brand new. Furthermore, in this economy where prices have gone up but salaries haven't I can't afford these payments and I CAN NOT POSTPONE THEM AT ALL. 

Lastly, I thought I had at least 5 months of a forbearance ( I was not fully employed ) left when the pause began that I ASKED TO BE ABLE TO FINISH OUT ( filled out a form for which was received but I did not receive a response ) and although my request seemed to have been accepted ( not rejected ) aidvantage is now saying I have not paid last months payment. 

During the admin forbearance they sent me emails telling me I owed them monthly, and but for their response to may last complaint, I wouldn't have known that I was in forbearance.

First, when I complained about them charging me interest rates for a variable account at over 14 %, I called and said I only have fixed-rate loans. They said I didn't and perhaps my daughter agreed to one. She did not. I asked for proof. They said I needed a lawyer to write a letter. I got a lawyer to write a letter. They responded with a threatening letter and said that if I wanted information I would have to pay {$36.00}. I paid the money and they sent one page with everything cross out in black and zero information. I asked the lawyer to write a second letter saying that I would need access to the audio account in which I agreed to a variable loan. They refused and threatened me again. 

In addition to this, Discover entered into a long list of predatory practices. They intimidated and gave false information and and offered zero payment plans. One call told me that we were not eligible for a .5 % discount for auto withdrawal while another call to an agent in a different city commented that they could not understand why I was told that. 

The worst were the people in the XXXX XXXX office who I tended to get when I called. One time they """" accidentallty '' applied my payment to the wrong loan which would have had us in a charge out. 

My daughter is very smart and she talked to a person who told me that if she didn't pay her loan for XXXX  days, then she could get a loan amount of about {$500.00} per month instead of {$850.00}. She told me she had it handled and I was contacted when it was about to charge off. 

The XXXX XXXX XXXX office was very predatory. I would call for a simple thing, like to change the dates of my direct payment to match with paydays. They would tell me to call back at a specific time the next day. They insisted that they couldn't tell me any information as I am the cosigner. There were so many lies and so many times that I got a different story from a different agent. Once when I was told, """" I don't know who would have told you that, '', they suggested a name. I called that office so often that I knew that guy was out on paternity leave. I have pages of notes. This company is horrible. They are predatory and can not be trusted. I am currently in the process of filing for bankruptcy, largely due to being unable to support myself due to this loan. My daughter does not have any credit card debt, but she is also prepared to file bankruptcy if needed. 

We were both traumatized by these people. They had her in tears and told her things that were different than they told me. Finally, I did not allow any calls to them without us both on the line and they commented that they really needed to talk to use separately.","","DISCOVER BANK","PA","19119","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-20,"Closed with non-monetary relief","Yes","N/A",8185226,2024

2024-03-11,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","Hello, I would like to file a complaint against Edfinancial Services as they continue to make errors on my monthly statements and do not respond to complaints in a timely fashion. While my inquiries are pending with Edfinancial Services, the errors on my account continue to accumulate, as I routinely receive XXXX notices despite paying more than the amount listed on my monthly statements. A cursory search online shows that this behavior is common for for many borrowers who use Edfinanical Services. 
Please find my supporting documents XXXX attached, and the page numbers of the supporting documents referenced in the detail below. 

Detail XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a statement from Edfinancial Services dated XX/XX/XXXX that stated that my last scheduled payment had not been received ( Page XXXX ), despite the fact that my account had been set up to autopay the full amount for years. When contacted on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, Edfinancial Services admitted that this was an error on their end due to their servicing system transfer ( XXXX XXXX ). 

XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice from Edfinancial Services that my new monthly payment amount would be {$240.00} for 12 months starting XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ). 

XXXX. In a statement dated XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ), Edfinancial Services XXXX XXXX the next regular monthly payment amount due would be {$480.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX. The statement also showed a past due amount of {$230.00}, despite the fact that the normal amount of {$240.00} had been auto-debited from my account on XX/XX/XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX ( Page XXXX ). The statement gave a final total due XX/XX/XXXX of {$710.00} ( XXXX XXXX ) XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a statement from Edfinancial Services dated XX/XX/XXXX that stated that my last scheduled payment had not been received and was now past due ( Page XXXX ), despite no changes to my autopay service. 

XXXX. I contacted Edfinancial Services on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to determine why the monthly payment was now listed as {$480.00} instead of the previously agreed amount of {$240.00}. I also inquired as to why my XX/XX/XXXX statement showed a past due amount of {$230.00}, despite prior payments above that amount. As of now, Edfinancial Services has not yet provided an explanation. 

XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, Edfinancial Services uploaded a document titled Billing Statement Enrolled in Auto Pay ( Page XXXX ). The document was a copy of a statement dated XX/XX/XXXX, which showed a current amount of {$36.00} due XX/XX/XXXX, and an autopay amount of {$280.00} scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ). I do not know why a document from XXXX was uploaded in XX/XX/XXXX without explanation. 

XXXX. Out of an abundance of caution, and in the absence of any explanation from Edfinancial Services, I made a payment in the amount of {$230.00} on XX/XX/XXXX to cover the past due amount that the website showed. I also made a payment for the full statement amount of {$710.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. As of XX/XX/XXXX, Edfinancial Services website still showed that I had a total payment due of {$230.00}, with a past amount due of {$230.00} on the website, while the statement showed a total amount of {$710.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX ( Page XXXX ). 

XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX my regularly scheduled payment of {$240.00} debited due to autopay. In addition to my payments on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I had paid a total of {$1100.00} to Edfinancial Services in the month of XX/XX/XXXX ( Page XXXX ). 

XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX the Edfinancial Services website showed that I owed a total payment due amount of {$710.00}, with an additional past due amount of {$710.00} ( Page XXXX ) despite the total of {$1100.00} paid to Edfinancial Services in the month of XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX. Also on XX/XX/XXXX, Edfinancial Services issued 30 Day multiple Delinquency Notice stating that my last scheduled payment had not been received, and that my account is now 30 days or more past due ( XXXX XXXX ). I have also received emails from the Department of Education stating that action was needed on my Federal Student Loans, as payments have been missed ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). I contacted Edfinancial Services on XX/XX/XXXX, however Edfinancial Services has not been able to provide any explanation to my queries, other than to state that they have added my questions to my prior request of XX/XX/XXXX ( Pages XXXX ). No notice was provided by Edfinancial Services as to when my prior request would be answered. 

XXXX. As of XX/XX/XXXX, my account summary page with Edfinancial Services shows that no recent payments have been made, with a total payment due amount of {$710.00}, and an additional past due amount of {$710.00} ( Page XXXX ), despite the total of {$1100.00} paid to Edfinancial Services in the month of XXXX XXXX 

XXXX. A cursory search online shows that these types of errors are common for Edfinancial Services, with many users reporting Edfinancial Services claiming that accounts are past due when they are not, as well as users reporting errors in Edfinancial Services XXXX system. CFPB has also sanctioned Edfinancial Services in the past for making deceptive statements to student loan borrowers, as well as misrepresenting forgiveness and repayment options ( XXXX XXXX ). 

Conclusion In summary, I would like to file a complaint against Edfinancial Services for the following reasons : XXXX. The amount I am billed every month changes from the agreed upon amount with little explanation. 

XXXX. Edfinancial Services routinely claims that my account is delinquent or past due despite timely payments made by me in excess of the amount listed on my monthly statements. 

XXXX. Edfinancial Services does not respond to user complaints/ queries in a timely fashion. 

XXXX. This behavior is not unusual for Edfinancial Services, as many other users experience similar behavior. 

At the time of this writing, Edfinancial Services shows that I owe {$1200.00}, including a past due amount despite the payments I made in XX/XX/XXXX. As I do not expect Edfinancial Services to respond to my queries, I fully expect that I will pay both this amount, as well as my regularly scheduled auto payment amount of {$240.00} scheduled to debit on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I am extremely worried that, after accepting my money, Edfinancial Services will claim I have a large past due amount despite the payments rendered, and it is very likely that Edfinancial Services will ( erroneously ) claim that my account will be delinquent for the third month in a row. I do not expect them to respond to my complaints before XX/XX/XXXX, and I have every reason to believe that the error in accounting is on their end, as this has happened before during XX/XX/XXXX. I am especially worried that this will negatively affect my credit, and will be result in more notifications from the Department of Education. 

Please help me out with this case, and I wish to offer my very heartfelt gratitude in advance. 

Thank you for your time, XXXX XXXX XXXX.

2024-01-20,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","On XX/XX/year> I attempted to contact Nelnet via email. I will include my message to them at the end of this section. I had my loans transferred from Great Lakes. I had set up an account on XX/XX/year> and could log in at the beginning to see a SAVE plan with {$0.00} payments. Nothing has changed in my circumstances, and I received no communication indicating a change, but suddenly my payments are {$330.00} a month. I am receiving automatic emails from Nelnet and Dept of Ed that action is needed on my account. However I am unable to reach anyone via phone due to unrealistic wait times and I am not able to get an email response from them. At this point I am so frustrated and distrustful that I would prefer only email communication from them for the sake of having a paper trail. I do not see why I need to pay back incorrect or misguided amounts ( or really owe them anything at all ) if they are not upholding their responsibility as a loan servicer and actually servicing the loan. All research Ive done online points to zero solutions and many others struggling with the loan servicer failing to service loans. 

My goal is to rectify the account to reflect having a {$0.00} payment, erase the negative balance and consequences from this, and make Nelnet understand I can only uphold my end of this if they also do their job. Not only do I find these loans predatory in the first place, but this is absolute torture. 

The email was as follows : I am writing to rectify an issue with my Nelnet account. 

Upon making my account after my loans were transferred from Great Lakes, the website indicated I was on the SAVE plan with {$0.00} payments. I expect this information to be correct simply as a bare minimum expectation per the agreement of the borrower and loan servicer. However, this is additionally important due to extenuating circumstances I have faced this year. 

I have now received correspondence that my account is past due. The notice is dated XX/XX/year>. 

I expect this balance to be corrected, for interest accrued to be adjusted accordingly, and for the SAVE plan to be verified on the account. The account upon set up was in SAVE status per the website, so additional payments and processes should not be necessary. The account was set up XX/XX/year>. To reiterate, the balance and interest to be corrected. I will keep documentation of these correspondences, including the ones incorrectly indicating I have payments due. I will conduct all correspondence in writing to later verify my efforts to keep my account correct if necessary, as I am displeased with the transfer of my loans to a servicer that does not seem to be organized or respectful of the borrowers time and money. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to having this promptly resolved and having a straightforward relationship between borrower and servicer in the future.

After a while of thinking my extra payments were processing, I further investigated and they were in fact NOT, and each time I was met with failure notifications via email. I tried again and still Mohela has not accepted my additional payments. 

I called Mohela in XXXX to further discuss/address this situation and a very new, unexperienced employee had no solution to my problem and told me to contact my bank as it was an issue with processing. 

I contacted my bank and they said there were NO ATTEMPTS to take out the funds. Interestingly enough, they are taking my minimum payments ( Since XXXX ) with ease according to my bank statements every month. 

I've tried again this month ( XXXX ), to pay off one loan in full this month on top of my minimum payment. I remain hopeful it will be processed and that I am not met with another Online Payment Failure Notification email. And if not, I know this poor establishment is happy to continue to rack up my interest. Horrible.

I am not the primary borrower, my son is. My son makes all payments of both principal and interest on his loan not me. By MEFA assigning me as the primary borrower all paperwork including IRS 1098E comes in my name and not my son 's. 
My son is due a {$490.00} refund on his federal income taxes from the student loan interest which he paid which he can not get because MEFA put my name as the primary borrower not my son. I did not sign up as the primary borrower and the IRS will not give him his refund because the 1098E is in my name and also say that I should contact the lender ( MEFA ) which I did multiple times and was told the only way to have this poor policy on their part changed is for my son to refinance his loan and we all know where interest rate have gone since this loan was applied for in 2019. The next time I called I was instructed to call their billing department and that maybe they could help me, which turns out to be XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) billing and payment service company who MEFA uses whom I had already called asking why they kept sending the monthly bill to me and not my son. When I called XXXX I was told that I had to talk to MEFA and that is just how MEFA handles their loans and I do not think this is right. It is fraudulent to assign me as the primary borrower when i was the co-signee of the loan. 
I had my son sign up for autopayment of his loans plus a little extra principal every month to shorten the loan and pay less in the long run, to keep me from receiving monthly bills and to make sure that all payments were made on time to aid my son in developing some credit for future borrowing if needed. So XXXX and presumably MEFA knows that my son is paying the interest, yet the send the 1098E form in my name knowing that I don't pay the interest and have no right to claim my son 's valid deduction for the interest paid. 

So now my son and myself are stuck between the IRS, MEFA, and XXXX and they are all point to each other to have this issue resolved and get my son the refund he is due. I believe that this poor policy by MEFA is just wrong and needs to be corrected.","","Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority","MA","019XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-03,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8098937,2024

My student loans are in process of being discharged. Under the settlement agreement class members are to remain in Administrative Forbearance till the loans are discharged. 

DOE has sent me emails and letters to Mohela on at least 2 occasions to keep me, as well as other class members, on admin forbearance. Mohela now going on the third time has removed and put me into repayment. They in fact put me into repayment again on XX/XX/XXXX with a due date of XX/XX/XXXX. Not only is this a violation of the settlement, but servicers are required to provide 21 days to even bill- which this in violation of on both accounts. 

Ok all occasions Ive had to call Mohela and talk to customer service who lack all knowledge and state DOE sent letter to take me off. Never have they provided me this letter, and when I reach out to DOE they state thats not true and Im to remain on forebearance till discharge - DOE have sent 2 letters to Mohela stating to put me back in. Im tired of fighting with these idiots at this point. 

Mohela had done this to others in the lawsuit as well. Mohela had already been fined {$7.00} million for improperly billing and also putting people in repayment that should not be. They are again doing the same thing. 

At this point, if not resolved for me, and other class members, we will seek a class action lawsuit against Mohela and DOE in violation of XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX settlement- I suggest Mohela out me into Admin Forbearance immediately before it costs a lot of money to your company for violation of a federal class action lawsuit. 

If this isnt rectified I will contact an attorney and led a class action against Mohela for violations of a settlement agreement.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","NY","127XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-07,"Closed with non-monetary relief","Yes","N/A",8119398,2024

They also do not allow payments made XXXX  days in advance to count for the next upcoming payment. I wanted to pay off a few months in advance, but was unable to do so. However, the main issue right now is the following : On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from MOHELA saying that my payments from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/2023, would be counted toward my future payments. I had already made {$590.00} in payments during that time, and my monthly payment is {$430.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a bill saying that I owe {$430.00} by XX/XX/XXXX. This doesn't make sense. My XXXX bill, and {$160.00} of my XXXX bill should be covered by my past payments. I wrote to MOHELA -- since it is virtually impossible to get through to anyone on the phone -- that I want my payments applied properly to my future payments or to send me a refund so that I can pay my XXXX bill on time. I would prefer if they simply applied my payment to future payments. 

MOHELA did not take either of these actions. Instead, they called and left a voicemail asking me to call back. Again, it is virtually impossible to get through to anyone on the phone, so this situation has been left unresolved. 

MOHELA has been an absolute nightmare to work with, especially during this transitional period back to paying student loans.

I applied for the SAVE plan as I was on IDR prior to the Federal forbearance period for student loans. I applied for SAVE the MOMENT we were able to apply. I got an update on my Aidvantage portal that my Repaye-to-SAVE had been approved and then a calculation that was astronomically incorrect ( around $ XXXX ). So I reached out to Aidvantage to let them know. They said they were aware of the miscalculation and if I resubmitted my SAVE application, it would be addressed. So I resubmitted my SAVE IDR information. Then I never got an update. So I called back in to see the update. They told me the payment amount should be much lower ( closer to $ XXXX ), but there was no documentation for me to see that online as the most recently documents available still had the XXXX incorrect calculations. She said they were still calculating my SAVE application and it would be done within 60 days. XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed my student loan balance continues to increase, which it is not supposed to do when on the SAVE plan. I contacted Aidvantage AGAIN about this. They said they are still calculating the amount due ( what?! ) and it's a 60-day turnaround. I asked for documentation to be updated and they said there isn't an updated document. I asked if they'd be removing the interest that was accruing on the account as SAVE isn't supposed to have interest accruing and they were the ones that have incorrectly calculated the amounts. They admitted to incorrectly calculating. They said no interest would be removed. After a lot of pushback, they said they'd be willing to remove interest going back to my 3rd ( and most recent ) submittal of SAVE in late XXXX since that was """" when I applied for SAVE ''. After even MORE pushback and demanding a supervisor, they admitted that I applied for SAVE earlier ( late XXXX, which was actually the SECOND application after I noticed they messed things up on the first application ). When I was pushing back to get them to look further and how I applied for SAVE EARLIER than that because I had a response from THEM about the update in early XXXX, they disconnected the call. I keep attempting to call and get this updated to no avail. In the meantime, this company is charging me interest, raising the balance owed, and no resolutions in sight for this.

I received a correspondence letter on XX/XX/XXXX saying that """" MOHELA has placed my account on Administrative Forbearance from XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX while my SAVE application was being processed. There was a lot of misinformation going around whether those months in forbearance would count towards PSLF. So, in XXXX of XXXX, I called MOHELA to ask whether the Administrative Forbearance would count towards PSLF. The representative told me no, so I asked for it to be removed. When I asked why it was taking several weeks for my application to be processed, the representative scolded me and told me that I knew that the COVID pause was ending, and I should have made plans for repayment before this. After that it took several weeks before my request for Administrative Forbearance to be removed. My SAVE application never got processed and I was dropped from forbearance on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I called on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to a representative about being placed back on administrative forbearance since MOHELA gave me misinformation about the Administrative Forbearance as the months do count towards PSLF. I was told that the representative was in training and that they couldn't just place me back in Administrative Forbearance. I was then transferred to a senior representative. The senior representative had me complete two more SAVE applications since they didn't know why my initial one from XX/XX/XXXX was on hold. I was also told the Administrative Forbearance would be placed back onto my account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, a bill with an amount of {$440.00} was sent to my inbox with a due date of XX/XX/XXXX. I called MOHELA again on XX/XX/XXXX and asked about the bill. The representative told me not to worry about the payment since the SAVE application was being processed and the forbearance would be applied back on my account. I asked if I should pay by the due date while this was all being sorted. The representative told me no since it was an error, and my application should be processed shortly. I was also told that my application would be expedited since I initially applied in XXXX of XXXX. The representative further stated that there's a 15-day grace period for late payments so don't worry about paying it. 

I called back on XX/XX/XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX ( bill due date ) was a Sunday and MOHELA was closed. I was told that it takes a few weeks for the SAVE application to be processed and for the forbearance to be applied to my account. 

I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and was transferred twice. I finally spoke to someone in the resolution center, who was able to figure out why my applications werent being processed. I was directed to fill out another SAVE application. They said I would be put back on forbearance while the Save Application was being processed and the forbearance would be backdated to XX/XX/XXXX due to being on the wrong IDR plan. 

The documents I received from MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX say """" delinquency forbearance from XXXX and general forbearance XXXX. '' Another document received on XX/XX/XXXX says """" general forbearance until XXXX. '' I called yesterday on XX/XX/XXXX to ask about my documents showing a delinquency forbearance and a senior representative told me that since I didnt pay back in XXXX a delinquency forbearance was placed on my account. I asked for it to be removed and was told that they couldn't do that, and to just wait to see if when they do the recount whether that month will count. I told the representative that I made decisions based on the information their representatives were giving, and she apologized for the misinformation but said that there really wasn't much else to resolve. I can either wait 60-90 business days for the two additional SAVE applications that are still pending to see if the request for forbearance to be backdated for XXXX or to wait for the recount and hope that those months count. I also inquired why the documents saying processing forbearance and not administrative forbearance and was told they are the same thing. 

Overall, this process has been very frustrating with MOHELA. The representatives answering the phone at MOHELA are all in training and give a lot of misinformation. The wait times to speak with a representative are ridiculously long ( 1-3 hours ). Getting answers is impossible.

2024-01-12,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","Hello, I am writing to you in regards to filing a complaint against Mohela. My communication correspondence with Mohela has caused me extreme stress and XXXX  because of the continuous misinformation I get when I call and speak with them. After many phone calls and speaking to countless managers and supervisors, I do not know how to move forward. In XXXX, I requested my XXXX Loan Forgiveness application be canceled and nothing has been done. I requested this be done because it would possibly interfere with my Public Loan Forgiveness Program that states after 120 consecutive payments, a borrower 's loans will be forgiven entirely. In the past, an educator could not combine the years of service for both programs. However, recently there was a one time waiver opportunity that allowed borrowers to do so, but the waiver has now expired. However, I did complete it and have it on file with Mohela. Also, the Department of Education recently announced they are doing a new One time IDR Account Adjustment. I have had many questions about the programs, the special waivers, account adjustments and canceling my application but Mohela has continued to give me different information each time I call asking questions and requesting action be taken on my account. Below, I explained every communication correspondence I have had with them as I have kept a record of everything. I hope you can look into my situation. I am extremely worried and this has caused me so much stress and XXXX. 

-On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted my XXXX Loan Forgiveness application. As of today, I have been an XXXX XXXX XXXX  for 5 consecutive years for the same XXXX XXXX XXXX. The XXXX Loan Forgiveness program would forgive up to {$5000.00} of my loans because of my years of service in a qualifying XXXX. 
-On XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX Loan Forgiveness application was put in APPROVED status. I spoke to a representative at XXXX XXXX XXXX on this day letting her know I did further research and would like to cancel my XXXX Loan Forgiveness application due to it possibly interfering with my Public Service Loan Forgiveness application. I do not want to interfere with my current Public Service Loan Forgiveness application as the benefits of that program will help me more than the XXXX Loan Forgiveness program. The representative ( she ) let me know she submitted the request to another department for cancellation and it would take 2 business days to hear back an update. She did confirm it was not too late to do so since it was just put in APPROVED status. 
-On XX/XX/XXXX ( the same day ) I called back to ask the question regarding me having the Public Service Loan Forgiveness special waiver ; I had completed further research. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness special waiver allowed XXXX to essentially double dip and use their years of service for both Public Service Loan Forgiveness and XXXX Loan Forgiveness. Last year, I completed the special waiver form and they confirmed they had it on file. I explained that after doing research, I saw that an XXXX may no longer be able to combine the time of service for the XXXX Loan Forgiveness and the Public Loan Forgiveness. However, I did complete the Limited PSLF Waiver form before the XX/XX/XXXX deadline and it was processed as well as approved and my Public Service Loan Forgiveness payments are reflecting during that time. For my particular situation, the credit of payments would be for the same time of service I would be using to fulfill my XXXX  loan forgiveness requirement ( XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ). I explained that from my understanding, my XXXX loan forgiveness being approved will not interfere with credit I am receiving for the Public Student Loan Forgiveness program because I applied for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness during the limited waiver period. The representative confirmed that this is correct information. However, I told her I still wanted to cancel the XXXX  Loan Forgiveness application because I do not want to risk anything happening to my Public Service Loan Forgiveness payments. 
-I followed up and spoke to a representative XX/XX/XXXX and they confirmed seeing the request that was submitted on XX/XX/XXXX but they had no updates. 
-I followed up and spoke to a representative on XX/XX/XXXX and they confirmed seeing the request was submitted but they had no updates. 
-I followed up and spoke to a representative on XX/XX/XXXX and they confirmed seeing the request was submitted but they had no updates. 
-On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to a representative and they confirmed the request was put in an assignment to an agent to review and could take 10 business days. This was new information regarding the time frame of the request being fulfilled. 
-On XX/XX/XXXX, I received email communication from Mohela stating, MOHELA has reviewed your request for loan discharge and your application has been forwarded to the U.S. Department of Education ( ED ). ED will review your application and make a determination of your eligibility for discharge of the loan ( s ). You will be notified once ED determines whether you are eligible for discharge of the loan ( s ). This email was received after I submitted the request for cancellation for my XXXX Loan Forgiveness application and got confirmation from Mohela representatives that my request for cancellation had been submitted on XX/XX/XXXX. 
-On XX/XX/XXXX, I followed up with Mohela once again and spoke to a representative. The representative stated that she sees on her end, XXXXLF completed pending FSA ( Federal Student Aid ) Review. She then explained that the application was submitted and processed on XX/XX/XXXX. I let them know that is not true, my application was submitted on XX/XX/XXXX but it was not in APPROVED status till XX/XX/XXXX. This was the same day I requested it to be canceled. I brought up my question regarding the special waiver and having it on file. Mohela 's representative response was under the IDR one time account adjustment, if it counts towards the IDR account adjustment or forgiveness, it will count towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Further, they stated that different expectations of the rule- not special waiver. The representative further explained that it used to be difficult for people to qualify for forgiveness and the Department of Education is trying to correct this. The Department of Education is now doing a one time account adjustment by reviewing everyone 's student loans. Under IDR one account adjustment, they will count my time of service for Public Service Loan Forgiveness and XXXX Loan Forgiveness. I requested to speak with someone else to confirm this information. After being on hold for quite some time the representative responded and stated that they got feedback that the Public Service Loan Forgiveness would not count towards XXXX Loan Forgiveness. I explained that I have received mixed information regarding my unique situation and needed to speak to a manager. After being on hold, a manager stated that under the IDR one time account adjustment the time of service will allow me to potentially qualify for both programs. I told this manager all the steps I have taken thus far and the feedback I received. They stated this was now an escalation case and they would transfer me to someone else to look into this. They stated I will not lose time due to IDR one time account adjustment. The representative confirmed seeing on their end that I requested to cancel my XXXXLF application t on XX/XX/XXXX. However, they can not cancel it because it has already been sent to the FSA. They further explained that I will still be eligible under IDR one time account adjustment because if it counts towards IDR forgiveness, it will count towards it. Still have qualifying payment under IDR one time account adjustments, XXXXLF will not cancel out. The representative also confirmed not seeing a resolution on their end regarding the XXXXLF application request being canceled on XX/XX/XXXX. However, the supervisor stated that it is too late to cancel but should be fine due to IDR account adjustment. 
XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke to a representative know I was following up because after doing further research I discovered that the IDR one time account adjustment is very similar to Public Service Loan Forgiveness limited time waiver, however, what is not included is the XXXX Loan Forgiveness and eligibility so I wanted to follow up on my request to cancel my XXXX  Loan Forgiveness application. I explained speaking to a manager a few days ago and them telling me I would be fine because of the IDR one time account adjustment. I explained that no money has been removed from my account, and my request to cancel was the same day it was APPROVED. The first representative stated that he does see the qualifying payments from XX/XX/XXXX- XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX Qualifying payments ) will not be interfered with due to IDR one time account adjustment. He then went to the studentaid.gov website and read that *The only exception to this is if you applied for PSLF during the limited PSLF waiver period* He stated, I believe you will be fine. He further stated seeing the request to cancel but the application was already sent to FSA to be approved. He sent a message to the supervisor stating borrower would like for the XXXX Loan Forgiveness application to be suspended or withdrawn and it could take 3-5 business days to get done. He then said he had permission to send me to a customer service supervisor. This customer service supervisor stated that we can get that canceled for you and placed me on hold. She came back and said that she saw the request that was submitted XX/XX/XXXX and it was done. I asked for documentation because even though I requested for it to be submitted, I continuously keep calling because I never got confirmation it was fully done and completed. She confirmed it has been done and the letter will be sent out and FSA will need some time to update my account. 

It is now XX/XX/XXXX, I have not received any letter or email that states that my XXXX Loan Forgiveness application was canceled. My Mohela account says the XXXX Loan Forgiveness application was """" APPROVED '' and no money has been forgiven - my student loan balance is still the same.The last Mohela representative I spoke to let me know I would receive documentation that my request had been done. I have taken all the necessary steps to do so and my account has not had any updates. 
My frustration and concern comes from Mohela 's mixed responses on my ability as a borrower to use my years of service for both the XXXX Loan Forgiveness program and the Public Loan Forgiveness program. Every single supervisor/manager/representative gave me different feedback on my situation. Nevertheless, I requested for my application to be canceled. If the application goes through because Mohela did not cancel the application like I requested many times, I will potentially lose XXXX Public Service Loan Forgiveness payments and I will be absolutely devastated. The {$5000.00} XXXX Loan Forgiveness amount does not help me like the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, I rather just work towards this program. All my service as an XXXX has been dedicated to working in a XXXX XXXX XXXX  to ensure I can receive forgiveness on my student loans. I feel I have done my due diligence and Mohela continues to not provide me accurate information and correctly submit my request.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","AZ","XXXXX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-12,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8148921,2024

Once in XXXX and once today XX/XX/XXXX. I was advised this can not be fixed.

It is stressful dealing with this matter since you can not get through to them without being on hold for long periods and they don't offer weekend hours. Also, they don't respond to the emails, especially the XXXX emails that I have repeatedly sent regarding the erroneous processing of loan # XXXX. I want my loan to be processed under the same program that the other loan is being processed since I applied for the XXXX program for both loans. This is truly incompetence at its best, failing to acknowledge a program that the customer has applied for, failure to comply with the guidelines that adhere to resolving disputes, and failure to communicate. Sending notices to the credit bureau without solving or addressing the issues is a sign of the inability to fairly handle the processing of student loans.

Only one of my 3 loans was eligible for it ( a subsidized XXXX XXXX, disbursed in XX/XX/XXXX ). My application was approved in XX/XX/XXXX, giving me a monthly payment of {$200.00} on this loan. Barely two weeks later, I got another email from Aidvantage saying that my loan terms had changed, and my monthly payment on my SAVE-eligible loan was now {$770.00}. Please find attached the pdf correspondence from Aidvantage documenting this timeline of events. 

I am a model debtor : Ive never been in default over the life of my loan. I have excellent credit. I just got engaged and am trying to save up for my wedding, and a total monthly payment of over {$900.00} would make that impossible for me. I applied for the XXXX program because it was supposed to lower my monthly payment, not increase it by over 700 %! 

If I may speculate, it appears to me as though Aidvantage deliberately shortened that loans payback time, so that I would have to pay it off quicker, thereby raising my monthly payment. Is that even legal? While its true that paying off any of my loans faster technically saves me money in the long run, I did not agree to those terms, ever. My other 2 loans are stafford unsubsidized, and according to Aidvantage, they are scheduled to be paid off in XXXX ( see pdfs labeled """" stafford '' as documentation ). The loan thats the subject of complaint is currently scheduled to be paid off at the end of XXXX! 

I have the following questions : XXXX. Why did the payment due date change from XXXX, to XXXX, to back to XXXX? 
XXXX. Why did my payment jump from {$200.00} to {$770.00}? 
XXXX. How can this be remedied? 
XXXX. Finally, is it advisable to refuse to pay Aidvantage until my complaint is addressed? I do not wish to accidentally agree to a monthly payment of {$770.00} by paying my other loans.

2024-01-30,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Don't agree with the fees charged","I submitted my student loan for Federal consolidation in XXXX and selected Ed Financial as my loan servicer. They paid my full consolidated loan balance to XXXX ( my previous servicer ) as of XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$10000.00} and provided proof via letter. This payoff was also reflected in a letter from XXXX and on my account from StudentAid.gov. 

On XX/XX/XXXX Ed Financial sent me a statement showing my loan terms and my monthly payment, which reflected an administrative forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX and a lifetime loan balance of {$13000.00} ( the original {$10000.00} plus interest ). At that time, Ed Financial had mistakenly placed me in a level repayment plan. As part of my consolidation, I had applied to be considered for a XXXX or IDR plan, due to being eligible for loan forgiveness under the 25 year graduate school repayment provision in XXXX. I called Ed Financial on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to them via phone regarding their mistake. They advised me that they could not locate my application for IDRXXXX and advised that I apply for my loan to be considered for IDR/XXXX  through their website. I followed they advice. I was told that should the XXXX  or IDR plan be a monthly payment above what I could afford, I could always call back and request that I re-enroll in the level repayment plan. 

I logged into my account on XX/XX/XXXX to check the status of the XXXX/IDR application and see if there were any loan updates. My Ed Financial account shows a currently due total loan balance of {$310000.00} ( two separate {$15000.00} loans ). These show in my EdFinancial account where they previously showed correctly ( two {$5200.00} loans ). Upon seeing this, and not being able to locate any additional information or documentation in my online account, I contacted EdFinancial at their XXXX customer service help line. I spoke with agent XXXX. XXXX stated that she was unable to determine what was going on with my loan. When I asked XXXX if she could see the loan disbursement letter from Ed Financial that was sent on XX/XX/XXXX from their agency, she said no. When I asked XXXX if she could see the repayment schedule letter sent from Ed Financial on XX/XX/XXXX she said no. When I asked XXXX if she could see the original payoff amount to XXXX in the account history in the amount of {$10000.00} she said she could no see that on her end. At that time I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was told there was none available. XXXX advised that I log into my StudentAid.gov account and verify my loan amount posted. I made XXXX hold on the line and did so. My StudentAid.gov account shows the correct loan amount ( {$10000.00} ). When I shared that with XXXX she had not explanation for the discrepancy. She blamed on on """" something I did. '' Again I asked to speak to a supervisor. Again I was told that none was available. I asked XXXX for her agent ID and for a transcript of the call, which I knew was being recorded. She told me that they were unable to email transcripts of call to customers. I asked XXXX to verify that my account was in administrative forbearance and she did. I also asked XXXX to place a note on my account that my EdFinancial account shows a fraudulent balance of $ XXXX which does not match my account history and documentation provided by EdFinancial, nor does it match the amount reflected on StudentAid.gov, the Federal loan website. XXXX offered that a supervisor would call me on my cell phone within 24 to 48 hours. 

I am waiting to hear from them. They have offered verification of none of the documentation that their own agency had sent me, they denied my request for record of the call, and they repeatedly refused to transfer my call to a supervisor.

2024-01-31,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I graduated from business school in XXXX XXXX XXXX with XXXX different student loans. On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for the SAVE program to lower my required interest payments on my student loans, which would help me pay for my recent XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. FSA passed on this application to Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX. Nelnet officially accepted my application on XX/XX/XXXX, and changed both of my XXXX XXXX  loans to the SAVE program, but failed to change my XXXX XXXX  loans to the SAVE program - instead, they were marked """" Standard Repayment ''. 

My total loan principal is {$210000.00} and I had no income as of my SAVE program application date. Under the SAVE program, interest above required monthly payments is forgiven. During the period from my application date until XX/XX/XXXX, my monthly loan payment should have been {$0.00}. My interest accrual therefore should have also been {$0.00} according to the SAVE program guidelines.

I called Nelnet 's Customer Service line on XX/XX/XXXX and waited on hold for XXXX hours before the end of business hours required me to hang up. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX in the morning and after over XXXX hours ' wait I was able to speak with a customer service representative. I asked why the SAVE program wasn't applied to XXXX of my loans, how long it would take for the SAVE plan to show up on the other XXXX loans, and whether I needed to take any further action. The representative stated that I did not have to take action, that she flagged my account for action, and that I should check back in within a few weeks for the SAVE program to be fully processed. Weeks passed, then months, and nothing changed.

On XX/XX/XXXX, my annual income changed to {$72000.00} after I was hired for my first job following graduation. Although I'm not required to re-verify my income until XXXX year after my initial SAVE application date, I reapplied for the SAVE program on XX/XX/XXXX in a second attempt to fix the XXXX loans that remain in """" Standard Repayment ''. Nelnet received the new application on XX/XX/XXXX. Still, XXXX of my XXXX loans are in Standard Repayment. Now, all XXXX of my loans ' status are marked """" XXXX XXXX XXXX ''. 

Throughout the period from XX/XX/XXXX until present day, I have been unable to enter repayment due to a failure of Nelnet to apply the SAVE program to XXXX of my XXXX student loans. I believe that Nelnet is maliciously failing to apply the SAVE program to my account in an attempt to delay the interest forgiveness provided by the SAVE program.

Since interest did not start accruing on my account until XX/XX/XXXX due to the end of the federal pause on interest accrual, this applies to the full interest balance of my loan.","","Nelnet, Inc.","MD","21230","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-31,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8260802,2024
2024-01-31,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Problem with customer service","On XX/XX/XXXX, I realized that I needed the due date for my student loan payments to align more efficiently with my monthly paycheck date. The same day, I submitted a request to Aidvantage to update my due date to the XXXX of every month. The same day, I received an automated response stating the loan servicer was experiencing higher than normal volume and that they would be happy to honor your due date change request, provided that your account is current and the payment due date you're requesting is on the XXXX through the XXXX day of the month. This automated response also stated the new payment due date may not take effect until your next monthly billing statement and you may need to make a payment based on your current due date before the new date becomes effective On the date of the request, XX/XX/XXXX, I had made all payments in full and on time. I had even paid more than the amount due on multiple occasions in an effort to reduce my principal amounts. XXXX response is unclear and inefficient. First, they say they will honor the request, but then say the request XXXX not take effect until the next pay period. Is this an acceptance of my offer for new payment terms or not? Regardless, I was unable to make the payment due on XX/XX/XXXX. As a result, the portal stated that my payment was overdue/late. This is concerning as it could impact my credit score by being reflected as a late payment. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made the outstanding payment. On XX/XX/XXXX, I resubmitted the request to change my due date to the XXXX of each month, but received the same automated response. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and aidvantage is still demanding i make payments on the XXXX. This is not feasible for me and could have severe ramifications on my credit score. As a first generation student with a recently deceased father and a chronically ill mother who never owned their own home, I recognize the importance of a good credit score. I am attempting to set mutually beneficial terms with Aidvantage for the repayment of my loans, even if it means I die in debt. However, their lackluster customer service and inability to fully process simple, basic claims puts me, my family and my future plans at risk.","","Maximus Education, LLC dba Aidvantage","GA","30318","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-31,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8260758,2024

2024-01-31,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Struggling to repay your loan","Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","I am reaching out to you as a borrower who has encountered issues related to the Public Student Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) program. My primary concern revolves around Mohela 's interpretation of a requirement that does not align with the legislative guidelines set forth for PSLF. 

According to my understanding of the legislation and the information available on the Department of Education website ( www.studentaid.gov ), borrowers are required to be employed at a qualifying employer when they make their 120th payment and when they apply for forgiveness. Nowhere in the legislative text or on the official Department of Education website does it stipulate that one must remain employed at that qualifying employer until the student loans are discharged. 

However, Mohela has conveyed a different interpretation, suggesting that continuous employment at the qualifying employer is a prerequisite for loan discharge. This contradicts the information available on the Department of Education 's website, leading to confusion and concern on my part. By all accounts, I have completed the requirements outlined by this program when I made my 120th payment and submitted my application on XX/XX/2023. 

Additionally, Mohela has asserted that their guidance on this matter comes from the Department of Education. This raises questions about the consistency and accuracy of information provided by Mohela, as it appears to conflict with the official guidelines from the Department of Education. In talking with various Mohela representatives over the past several months, I have also received inconsistent answers. Some representatives say I can leave my qualifying employment and some ( most ) say I can not. 

The miscommunication, inconsistency, and apparent misunderstanding of the legislative requirements have caused significant stress and uncertainty for me as a borrower seeking PSLF. I believe it is crucial for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to be aware of these issues and to intervene to ensure that borrowers are treated fairly and transparently. 

I kindly request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's assistance in investigating this matter and facilitating a resolution.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","WI","54729","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-31,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8259569,2024

Because of this, your student loan account has been updated to ensure your successful return to student loan payments. You are not required to do anything to benefit from these updates to your account. 
Your account has been placed into an administrative forbearance ( meaning no payment is required ) for payments due between XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. You are not required to make a payment until XX/XX/XXXX and your account will not be considered delinquent. Be on the lookout for your next billing statement. 
o We will report your updated loan status to the nationwide Consumer Reporting Agencies.

o You may request to end this administrative forbearance by contacting us by mail, fax, or calling us at XXXX. 
o Please note, your forbearance may not go through the end of XXXX if there were other changes that have occurred on your account. This could be a result of activities such as application processing, your request to have the forbearance removed, or other actions. Please closely review your billing statements and notifications for your latest account status. 
The months of XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX will count toward income-driven repayment forgiveness and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX assuming all other requirements are met. 
Your interest rate is being set to 0 % from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX, which means no interest accrues during this period. 
If you made any payment ( s ) between XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, they will count toward your future payment ( s ).

There are some important things to know about your payments : o You may also, instead, contact us to request a refund for any payment made during this time.

o If you are enrolled in Auto Debit, monthly payments will continue to be withdrawn for your regular amount due each month plus any additional recurring amount you have requested. This will occur even after any payments you made for a due date in XXXX through XXXX have been applied toward your future payment ( s ).

o If you choose to make payments while your loans are at the 0 % interest rate, the full amount of your payments will be applied first to any interest that accrued prior to XX/XX/XXXX, if applicable, then to your principal balance. 
If you had an insufficient fund ( NSF ) fee charged because of a payment withdrawal between XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, you may request that your bank reverse the fees that resulted from the transaction.

If the bank will not reverse the charges, you may contact us to request a refund of the NSF fee. To request this refund, please provide a document with the following information : Your request to have the NSF fee refunded, your name, your bank information, and documentation that the withdrawal caused the NSF fee. You may submit your request by mail, fax, or uploading on mohela.com.

The loan consolidation covered all principal and interest at that point. In XX/XX/XXXX, all interest on student loans was paused, though I continued to make monthly payments to principal. When student loan payments resumed in XX/XX/XXXX, I all the sudden started having accrued interest showing on my loan ( this is in addition to {$11.00} in daily interest which I am aware is the cost of my loan ). The interest accrual continues to go up, despite making normal monthly payments that are to cover all principal and interest ( per the terms of the consolidation agreement ). I've even made additional payments, in the amount of the interest accrual, but the interest still remains. At this time, I am projected to have more interest owed than the monthly payment. For every other type of loan, if you make an extra payment and have outstanding interest - the payment goes to the interest owed first. Upon calling Nelnet, they can not articulate where the interest accrual is coming from, can not allow for payment of the interest accrual, and are unable and unwilling to help - despite being put on hours long hold.","","Nelnet, Inc.","NC","27587","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-02,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8274537,2024

2024-01-22,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","I applied for the XXXX plan in XX/XX/XXXX via the federal website. In XX/XX/XXXX I called Aid Advantage to determine when it would be approved. I was then told I needed to pay {$5.00} dollars to have my account changed from the Income Based Repayment Plan to the XXXX plan. I did that then. I was not informed that I could be placed on admin forbearance and that the processing would take 30 days. I was placed on a self-selected forbearance ( with impact to my credit score ). I called back on XX/XX/XXXX to find out what was going on with my approval for the XXXX plan. At that time I was told I needed to provide additional information. I did so on the phone and was placed on an admin forbearance. I was told my application would be processed in 60 days. 

I called back today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and was informed my application for the XXXX plan had been lost. Though the person I spoke to said, """" There is no record of your application. '' This person informed me that she could """" self-certify '' another application and that it would take another 60 days to be processed ( while interest accrues ). I asked why there was no record of my previous applications and she could not give me a clear answer. I then spoke to the manager, XXXX XXXX, who also could not give me a clear answer about what happened to my two previous applications as well as the supposed """" self-certify '' in XXXX. He said I was now in the application process for the XXXX  plan and in administrative forbearance for the duration of the next 60 days. He also assured me I would be sent a letter with a record of our conversation as well as confirmation of the admin forbearance and XXXX  application via the self-certify. 

I don't think this level of lack of clear information is just incompetence. I think this is an intentional policy of Aid Advantage to get loan consumers to accrue interest while they delay the processing of XXXX applications. Currently, there is a note on my Aid Advantage account on the website that says my forbearance will end in 10 days despite the fact the supposed due date for my upcoming full pay ( as the XXXX application is still not processed ) is XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX could not explain why this is the case. Supposedly, I will get an email confirmation of my current XXXX application via the self-certification, though I doubt I will because I never got one before and I have XXXX confidence in Aid Advantage. 

How is this legal? I am sure many student loan borrowers are experiencing these intentional delays from XXXX XXXX in order to accrue interest.

Then, XXXX split the Consolidated Loan Balance into two Consolidated Loan Balances {$15000.00} and {$23000.00} based on Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans, but the Consolidated Loan Balances still = {$38000.00}. 

Thereafter, I applied for my XXXX Consolidated Loans to be forgiven due to XXXX from XXXX XXXX Treatment.

2024-02-08,"Student loan","Private student loan","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I have a private student loan from Firstmark services. On XX/XX/XXXX I made an additional payment of {$330.00} ( in addition to my auto debit monthly payments made on the XXXX of every month ). Per the payment page, under the title """" How do I submit special payment instructions online?, '' """" After submitting your payment online, you may contact Firstmark via phone or email to have this single payment applied as you wish '' I contacted firstmark by email with the following message, """" Hello, I paid {$330.00} today that I would like to be applied to principal only. This is a one time extra payment. My regular monthly payment will be auto debited on XX/XX/XXXX. '' I got the following response : """" Dear XXXX, Thank you for contacting Firstmark Services. 

When a payment is received, it is first applied to accrued interest, then to any fees ( if applicable ), and finally to principal. The interest on your loan ( s ) is calculated using the daily simple interest method, based on the principal balance and interest rate of your loan ( s ). 

To calculate how much interest has accrued on your account since your last payment, do the following : Multiply the principal balance by the interest rate ( i.e. {$10000.00} x .08 = {$800.00} ). 
Divide this amount by 365.25, which is the number of days per year ( i.e. {$800.00} / 365.25 = {$2.00} ). 
Multiply the daily rate by the number of days since your last payment ( i.e. {$2.00} x 5 = {$10.00} ). 
This is the amount of interest that has accrued on your account. 

All payments will apply in this manner, even if the due date is advanced. Payment due dates are a way of ensuring the loan is paid off within the term, and do not affect how your payment applies to your account. '' Despite my request, the payment was not applied to principal only. The way this payment was applied resulted in advancing my due date, despite my instructions. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I made another extra payment. At this time, my next due date was now pushed out a month to XX/XX/XXXX, WITH an auto debit payment scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. Again I requested, """" Please apply my payment of {$96.00} to principla only. This is an extra payment. '' ( please disregard my typo, I am trying to capture the exchange as accurately as possible, and the typo occurred in my email ). 

My payment history shows my payment was applied to interest first, with only {$17.00} applied to principal, despite being an entire month ahead on my payments. 

I called Firstmark ( today, XX/XX/XXXX ) to ask that they please honor the statement on their website about applying extra payments per my special instructions, which I submitted in writing, as they state to do. The Firstmark representative reported that they are not able to honor my instructions- all payments are always applied the same way : first to interest, then to fees, then to prinicipal. They stated that the only way I can make a payment to principal only is if I submit my extra payment on the same day as my auto debit, after my auto debit payment has posted, but before XXXX CST , so that there is a {$0.00} balance for interest and fees, and then the extra payment would be applied to principal. This is an incredibly difficult thing to time since I am in PST and my payment may not post on the same date as the due date, but before XXXX XXXX  CST. This appears an unattainable feat. Additionally, they provide written instructions for how to have your extra payment applied per your wishes. It seems they are either lying about this or not educated on how to do implement it.","","Nelnet, Inc.","CA","92103","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-08,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8300115,2024

I was never informed of my first loan repayment ( I received a past due letter instead ). 

I haven't received communication via phone, mail, email, or within Mohela module of such changes. I was simply informed of my past due bill and my upcoming bill. 

In the past I've had conflicting information from Mohela on my status. Mailed information has deferred from what is listed within the Mohela website account. 

Till this day I am not sure if I've been placed on the XXXX Plan. By the looks of the amount due I think I am not in the XXXX Plan.

2024-02-01,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Struggling to repay your loan","Problem with your payment plan","On XX/XX/2023, I signed up for a student loan consolidation and repayment plan on studentaid.gov. The repayment plan I signed up for had a 0.5 % interest rate once consolidated and the consolidation would be handled by AidVantage before eventually being handed over to XXXX for servicing. I have a screenshot from that day showing the rate quoted. In early XX/XX/2023, I received a letter in the mail stating my interest rate could be significantly higher than previously told to me, so I called AidVantage about it. I called on XX/XX/2023 and spoke with XXXX XXXX on a recorded call ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) about the letter I received and she told me that the letter was incorrect and that I did indeed have a 0.5 % interest rate locked in. She advised that I was only receiving the letter because of all the backed up loans coming back to repayment at the time. She told me not to worry, that my interest rate would definitely be 0.5 % when all was said and done. 
Sometime after that call my rate was changed to a 7.125 % interest rate and my newly consolidated student loan debt was handed over to XXXX at that higher rate. XXXX is telling me that if there was a mistake, then it was AidVantages fault. Studentaid.gov says they only handle applications. And AidVantage said I should talk to XXXX about it. This is a nightmare. I finally got an AidVantage manager/supervisor to email me about this and she said she listened to the call, heard me being told I had a 0.5 % rate, but is still refusing to adjust my rate to match what I signed up for and what they verbally told me was locked in. 
I need help. The payment theyre asking me to make is so much higher than I ever imagined and they are racking on interest with every passing month as Im fighting this. I just want the loan I was promised.","","Maximus Education, LLC dba Aidvantage","CA","92065","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-01,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8258603,2024

The court order gave servicers until XX/XX/2024 to discharge the debt, update our credit reports, and refund any money paid towards it. I continued to follow up with Nelnet.

2024-02-09,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Received bad information about your loan","I contacted Nelnet, my student loan servicer on XX/XX/XXXX regarding the One Time Pay Count Adjustment. After going through the automated phone system, someone answered, appeared to be in the middle of a personal conversation with someone else, and then disconnected the call. 

I called Nelnet back. After going through the automated phone system again, someone appeared to answer and then disconnected. 

I called Nelnet for a third time and was connected with XXXX. I explained that I was calling with questions about the One Time Pay Count Adjustment. She informed me any questions related to the One Time Pay Count Adjustment should be directed to the Department of Education because Nelnet does not have information to assist. I informed her that the Department of Education website instructs borrowers to call their servicer with questions ( which is what I was doing ), and asked which of my loans, if any, should be consolidated to fall under the benefits of the One Time Pay Count Adjustment. Without appearing to review my loans she informed me I should consolidate all of my loans. 

I have multiple loans/loan types taken out at different times, and they entered repayment at different times. I asked XXXX what the lookback period would be for my review, meaning what was the oldest repayment date. She was unable to assist. 

I was blind transferred to XXXX (? ) with the Consolidation Team. I explained the purpose of my call again and informed her that XXXX said I should consolidate all my loans. XXXX then informed me that none of my loans should be consolidated to receive the benefits of the One Time Pay Count Adjustment.

Based on information I read in various online FAQs, I had the impression that if I consolidated my Grad Plus loans from XXXX, with Direct loans that I have been repaying since the XXXX, the Grad Plus loans would benefit because the oldest loan under repayment is what the government would look to when determining how many years to credit under the One Time Pay Count Adjustment. XXXX informed me that was not correct, noting again that I do not need to consolidate any loans. By this time I had no confidence in the advice and information I was receiving from the Nelnet representatives so I stopped asking questions. Note : Neither asked me any questions about my loans or went through the loans with me. 

I do not know how to proceed at this time. I am having difficulty reaching Nelnet, as evidenced by the fact that I had to call three times before reaching someone without being disconnected. The Department of Education instructs borrowers to contact their servicer with questions about the One Time Pay Count Adjustment, but Nelnet claimed I need to call the Department of Education with questions.

There is a looming deadline associated with receiving the benefits of the One Time Pay Count Adjustment and I am completely lost as to if any of my loans need to be consolidated to receive the benefits ( or maximize the benefits ) of the One Time Pay Count Adjustment because 2 different Nelnet representatives in a single call gave me conflicting information. 
Finally, even if my loan types do not have to be consolidated to benefit from the One Time Pay Count Adjustment, I do not feel confident that I was provided accurate information about not needing to consolidate my newer loans with my olde
r loans to maximize the time credited. If the information I was provided is inaccurate on this point, then I will be penalized by having loans that will still be owed after the Adjustment is completed because they will not receive the same credited time as my older loans.","","Nelnet, Inc.","FL","34714","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-09,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8319450,2024

I spent many hours on the phone with Nelnet and uploaded completed and signed deferment form from my school. After 5 months of asking and begging for them to help, my loans continue to be in repayment and not deferment. 

I applied for deferment and uploaded proof of student full time status with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on the Nelnet website in my account. This is what Nelnet requested to process my application.

I did fresh start, i did consilidate, i was placed on idr/ save for ssome reason they shifted my idr to an ibr , they put an administartive forebearance on my account once i told them i had a pending idr and i dont owe them anything until that application has been processed. It got processed and approved but then they changed it to an ibr and i had to go back in and make them change it back via dept of ed bc i cant seem to reach ANYONE at aidvantage ... .this thing they did with my credit reporting companies XXXX  XXXX  and the other one is absolute XXXX... for as long as aidvantage conitinues to report increases to my balance my score will not increase and this is wreaking havoc on my credit score.

AND what makes it worse is to learn aidvantage did this to EVERYONE and other mistakes and now as of 6 days ago biden said everyone is going into forbearance and the unpaid interest is not to be added to peoples balances and Aidvantage won't answer my emails concerning what they've done to me? I'm waiting to see if administrative forbearance will happen and the interest they added to my balance will go away and my credit score to change for the better as a result. What they've done to people is unexcusable but they don't answer phones they don't respond to emails making complaints with department of ed to give to aidvantage idk if that ever happened ... .as my idr application literally sat at """" pending '' for 2 to 3 months..now I think dept of ed was on time with this and aid and aidvantage took there time and inaccurately billed everybody ...

2024-02-20,"Student loan","Private student loan","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","The first half of my loan was dispersed XX/XX/XXXX and I received a bill stating my first payment was due XX/XX/XXXX. I set up auto payment on my account for the amount due to be paid on the XXXX of every month. The XX/XX/XXXX payment when through with no problems. I received my second bill electronically on XX/XX/XXXX stating my next payment was due XX/XX/XXXX and it would be paid through autopay. There were no last fees or past due amount listed on the bill. On XX/XX/XXXX, auto pay was attempted 3 times, 2 of those were reversed-I am unsure why-and the 3rd auto pay attempt has gone through. On my account transactions tab on my online account, the 3rd attempt at payment shows that it went through. I also have confirmation from my bank ( XXXX ) that my account was debited on XX/XX/XXXX. The multiple attempts at autopay appear to have electronically triggered another bill in error. On XX/XX/XXXX I received another electronic bill for the same billing period ( XXXX ) for the same amount, listing the due date of XX/XX/XXXX even though it had already been paid. The XX/XX/XXXX bill stated it would be paid through autopay on XX/XX/XXXX ; my past due amount on this bill also stated XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, my monthly electronic bill was generated stating I now had a past due amount for the due on XX/XX/XXXX even though my account had already been paid. This bill stated that my total due amount was double my previous monthly amount. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a past due notice-well after my payment had been received on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, my bank account was also debited double the monthly amount due through autopay, thus representing a """" extra '' payment since I was not past due to begin with. I called customer service 4 times on XX/XX/XXXX to try and fix the error. I was given multiple different reasons for why I received a past due notice, with none of them making sense. These are the reasons I was given : XXXX ) the past due notice was sent prior to my payment being received. This is false. My payment was received on XX/XX/XXXX while the notice was generated on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ) My account was past due from XX/XX/XXXX and payed up on XX/XX/XXXX. This also false, my XXXX bill, generated on XX/XX/XXXX does not list a past due amount. Additionally, no payments are listed on my account nor was bank debited on XX/XX/XXXX. 
XXXX ) My monthly total is actually {$66.00} so I was underpaying, thus, the past due notice. This also incorrect. I have referred back to my bills, and the total amount due has never said {$66.00} and my previous bills did not list a past due amount until the XX/XX/XXXX bill following the multiple attempts at autopay and reversals. When I asked the customer service member where she """" found '' that monthly payment, she could not tell me. She simply told me """" well that's what your monthly payment is. '' My assumption is she was looking at something on my loan documents that included BOTH of my dispersement however only XXXX dispersement ( half of the total loan amount ) has only been dispersed at this time. Multiple times, the customer service agents assured me that I had not incurred any late fees, nor had the """" late payment '' been reported to the credit bureaus. I find this to be unacceptable. If the company made an error, it should be corrected regardless of whether it was reported or fees were incurred. I attempted another call on XX/XX/XXXX and asked for a supervisor. I was told a supervisor was not available but one could call me back in XXXX business days. At this point, I have little confidence that College Ave will actually follow through.","","College Ave Student Loan Servicing, LLC","MO","641XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-20,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8384350,2024

On XX/XX/XXXX, Mohela provided a response that did not specifically address my complaints and included blatantly false information. 

Mohela is either grossly incompetent in managing the dates of correspondence, requests and actions, or blatantly dishonest. Either scenario is unacceptable. 

My feedback on the response is as follows : The response is not accurate. Information the company provided about the SAVE plan is accurate NOW, but is not accurate as of the time I submitted the application. Since the time of the application, I have refinanced a significant amount of my loans. It is also not the servicer 's job to decide which repayment plan is best for me. Further, the complaint was about the fact that a forbearance was placed even though I did not request forbearance. The servicer states that the forbearance was removed as of XX/XX/XXXX but that is false. In fact, this complaint was submitted on XX/XX/XXXX and the forbearance was not lifted at that time. It has since been lifted, so this point is moot, other than Mohela 's lack of timely response and either their blatant dishonesty or their lack of competence around the timeline. 

Mohela states that payment instructions were submitted on XX/XX/XXXX. This is also blatantly false as evidenced by the correspondence I attached to the original complaint.

During each call, I am transferred """" up the ladder '' to various supervisors, enduring hold times often exceeding XXXX hour. None of the MOHELA representatives I spoke with could explain how or why the error occurred in transitioning XXXX of my loans to the """" LEVEL '' plan, and the matter was not corrected during the call. In XXXX, the proposed solution was to place my loans into a processing forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX, with the assurance that this would allow ample time for investigation and correction. However, the processing forbearance has just expired, and unfortunately, nothing has been corrected. 

Additionally, every attempt to speak with someone who has the authority to correct the issue has been thwarted. Despite being told I am being transferred to a supervisor during each phone correspondence, I end up on hold with the automated system disconnecting my call while waiting to speak to a supervisor. Regrettably, I have neither received a callback nor been provided with a direct means to contact a supervisor. Consequently, I must call back, reiterate my situation, be transferred multiple times, only to face disconnection again, resulting in hours wasted. 

Thank you for your time and assistance. I sincerely hope for a prompt resolution and look forward to hearing from you soon.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","CA","90042","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-01,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8257543,2024

This message stated that borrowers would not need to recertify their income until at least 6 months after payments resumed from the Covid student loan payment pause. As such and according to the message from FSA, borrowers with a recertification date listed on the FSA website that was prior to XXXX XXXX XXXX  would have their recertification date pushed back by 1 year into XXXX. 

The date listed for all of my loans on the FSA website is XX/XX/XXXX, and the date listed as my recertification deadline on the MOHELA website is XXXX. Based on this information, my recertification date should be pushed out to XXXX. However, MOHELA is demanding that I recertify now. They claim the XXXX dates are """" soft deadlines '' and they are using a """" hard deadline '' of XX/XX/XXXX. This """" heard deadline '' is not listed anywhere on my account, or has it ever been communicated to me. It also ignores the message from FSA that said the recertification date on the FSA website is the one to be used for this issue. MOHELA can not provide any information as to where the XX/XX/XXXX deadline comes from, or why they are refusing to follow the FSA guidance. 

Why is this important to my family 's financial situation? As many who are pursuing the PSLF loan forgiveness program and are on income driven repayment plans, I use this information to determine the best tax filing status for me and my family in order to reduce my loan payments. As a resident of a XXXX XXXX that received a special tax filing deadline extension due to natural disasters in XXXX, I wasn't required to file my taxes until after the FSA released the guidance described above. Therefore, I used this information to determine my family 's tax filings status. However, with MOHELA not following the FSA guidance, I will be required to use this tax information to recertify, and my payments will increase by over 1,000 % from $ XXXX to between XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","MOHELA","CA","957XX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-02-02,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8266374,2024

2024-01-30,"Student loan","Private student loan","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Keep getting calls about your loan","Have been unemployed since XXXX ; Navient has been bombarding me with automated spam calls, demanding payments on my private student loans ; at least once a day, up to 6-8 times. Speaking to representatives I have been told that there are no options to stop these calls and the best they can do is """" push them back '' for """" a couple of days ''. I do not answer my phone anymore ; seldom do they leave a voicemail message or identify themselves in any way. 

When they do leave a message it's a demand that I contact them by phone - they will not communicate Private Loans forbearances or repayment plans via email ; which can only be sent to them via the Navient website ; no records of emails I have sent to them are made available to me- I have to keep a record of them myself if I want to see more than a fragment of it in the correspondence posted. 

When I stopped responding to phone calls, they began calling and sending letters to my cosigners. In XX/XX/XXXX my mother paid the past-due balance after a letter threatening """" Review for Litigation '' arrived the XXXX- with only four days before the stated deadline of XX/XX/XXXX despite being dated XX/XX/XXXX. Seeing the postmark on the envelope indicates it was shipped on the XXXX, I have reason to believe this letter was purposely dated/postmarked in such a way to arrive """" late '' as an intimidation tactic. 

Navient has also refused to discharge the loans under the Attorneys General settlement where they were found to be using abusive and deceptive practices including pushing forbearances on cases of financial hardship rather than more viable options, so as to extend the loans further ; my case was refused on the grounds that my loans had """" never been in default, '' and so weren't eligible - ignoring that the school I attended with those loans was also found to be engaging in deceptive/abusive practices, and that my loans never defaulted because I had taken forbearances on Navient 's advice. My attempts to communicate this with them were refused and ignored. 

I have repeatedly stated that I have no stable income and am unable to make payments in the amounts demanded, making this harassment - they have ignored this and continued spamming my phone with calls and sending threats of litigation, knowing full well that I'm struggling with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and that my financial situation has not changed ; I have been informed I am no longer eligible for no-payment hardship forbearance on this loan and I have repeatedly asked for my payments to be lowered and late fees waived - which have all been refused. Navient refuses to negotiate payment in any way or allow any sort of relief without some manner of payment ; Speaking to """" XXXX XXXX '' over the phone tonight I was told they weren't even going to bother offering any repayment/relief options as I had stated before that I was unable to make any kind of payment at this time. 

Another letter threatening """" Review for Litigation '' arrived XX/XX/XXXX, dated the XXXX and demanding a """" satisfactory agreement to resolve your account by XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX'. The envelope is not postmarked in any way I can discern. Both it and the previous letter were sent from a return address belonging to """" XXXX XXXX XXXX' in XXXX XXXX PA - No mention of this company has been made in any of my communications with Navient, nor by anyone who called me about the debt.

For Example : Although I pay SIGNIFICANTLY more per month than I owe and well more than the interest charged in a given month, I am still, somehow, accruing interest. Further, you can not set up that amount on autopay if you want to pay over the amount due monthly. Instead, you have to log in to make that payment manually. When making that payment, if you want to specify where that payment should go ( which loan, principal or interest, etc. ), you have to call Nelnet to do so. Unfortunately, NelNet 's customer service is so horrendously bad that I have repeatedly sat on hold with them for up to XXXX hours at a time, only to be hung up on by what I assume is the machine before ever talking to a human. They SAY you can specify where your payments go, but in practice, it's impossible to get them on the phone. When you DO get them on the phone, it's clear they are both understaffed and untrained. NelNet representatives have given me incorrect and contradictory information. When I informed them of the correct information, as per their own website, they had no idea what I was talking about.","","Nelnet, Inc.","IL","60640","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-03,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8092624,2024

Despite submitting payments, I have observed a significant issue in the application of these funds to my loan account. This issue, unfortunately, has been seen by many borrowers as reflected in online discourse. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I requested for a payment of {$420.00} to be sent to Nelnet on my behalf from the XXXX portal. The payment was accepted by Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX but not reflected in my account at all. I called in fall of XXXX about this matter and was told the XX/XX/XXXX payment was actually my XX/XX/XXXX payment, which is not the case per my records. I felt they were trying to rush my off of the line. On XX/XX/XXXX I requested a payment of {$3600.00} to be sent to Nelnet on my behalf from the XXXX portal. The payment was accepted on XX/XX/XXXX and has not been applied to my account. This is a total of {$4000.00} dollars that has been sent and accepted by Nelnet but not reflected in my account as my account accrues interest daily making this an expensive and damaging error. I called on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about these two payments and was told to wait longer for the XXXX payment but that they would try to find out where the XX/XX/XXXX payment was. I have not heard back from the company yet, but it appears the {$420.00} has been credited to the account, there is still no indication of my {$3600.00} payment reflected in my account. 

This has not only caused unnecessary stress and confusion but has also led to concerns about the accurate reflection of my outstanding balance. I believe that prompt and accurate payment processing is crucial for maintaining a transparent and fair financial relationship. I kindly request an immediate investigation into these issues and a resolution that ensures the timely and accurate application of my payments to avoid any further disruptions in the future.","","Nelnet, Inc.","CA","92344","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-25,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8224694,2024

The core issues are that : In XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a request through studentaid.gov to enroll in the income driven repayment plan ( SAVE ). These were received by US Dept of Education and by Aidvantage ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX respectively ). 
I was placed on XXXX XXXX when I raised my previous complain because interest would continue to accrue ( although not capitalize ). 
I requested a resolution to my situation- confirm my placement on SAVE plan, confirm payment, take me off administrative forbearance, and waive interest during administrative forbearance. 

Case was closed on XX/XX/XXXX with company response of : """" A noninterest capitalizing administrative forbearance was processed on XX/XX/XXXX, while your Income Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application was reviewed.

'' Company took MUCH longer to process the application and accrued several thousand dollars of interest during administrative forbearance opportunistically and in DIRECT VIOLATION OF FSA and DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DIRECTIVES. 

Attached is a memorandum signed by Secretary of Education XXXX XXXX. Aidvantage 's response is a direct violation of the FSA recommendation and Department of Education Authority to """" Remediate Potential Harm to Borrowers Caused by Repayment Servicing Errors ''. 

On page 5 of the memo, it states under the section Lost Interest Subsidy """" If borrowers on the SAVE plan can not make a payment because servicer... placed them in administrative forbearance these borrowers will lose out on any potential interest subsidies for that month. The remediation for this is to ensure these borrowers ' balances do not increase due to interest while their monthly payments are being recalculated '' On Page 5/6, it states """" Pending your approval, FSA intends to instruct servicers to :... Ensure affected borrowers effectively do not accrue any interest while their accounts are being corrected '' On Page 10, it concludes """" FSA recommends that the Department use the Secretary 's compromise authority to adjust any interest accrued for affected borrowers while their accounts are being remediated. The memo also requests approval to grant credit towards IDR and PSLF for borrowers were taken out of repayment status and in an administrative forbearance to resolve these servicing errors. '' The memorandum was approved and signed by XXXX XXXX.

I have submitted 4 Income Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan requests to MOHELA, none of which have been processed/calculated correctly. I login to see the payment amount is {$77.00} a month when every estimate I've received from StudentAid.gov and from MOHELA themselves estimates my payment to be {$0.00} a month based on my income and filing status of MARRIED FILING SEPARATELY. I call to ask why this continues to be an issue and the front-line customer service representatives have no clue and just submit a new IDR application for me which continues to be incorrectly processed/calculated.

None of these methods produced different results which leads me to believe that the teams that process these applications are doing them incorrectly. My issue is threefold - 1 ) I need a payment I can afford and I can not spend the HOURS it takes to wait on the phone for MOHELA because assumingly thousands of others are experiencing similar issues 2 ) When I do get someone on the phone they are untrained, unaware, and unhelpful. Most are totally unaware of the different provisions of the program I am applying to ( SAVE program allows for married couples filing separately to NOT include their spouse 's income, which most reps were surprised by or flat out told me I was wrong ) 3 ) StudentAid.gov and MOHELAS OWN CALCUALTOR ON THEIR WEBSITE say I should be paying a MUCH smaller amount than I am, yet every time it is processed the amount is VASTLY incorrect.

I contacted Nelnet, spoke to a representative over the phone, and the representative mentioned that processing payments take time, therefore while my payment was processing, interest accrued. However, after my payment in XX/XX/XXXX processed, I somehow still owed {$100.00}.

The representative also told me that if I paid {$100.00} today ( accounting for interest accrual until the payment processes ), I would payoff my loans.

2024-01-04,"Student loan","Federal student loan servicing","Dealing with your lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are being handled","I have tried to make several payments on my XXXX loans, auto-allocated, all of which have had a """" payment reversal ''. I started trying to make payments several months ago when the interest rate was at 0 %, which has now ended. So I was unable to take advantage of this, because my payments were being reversed. 

There is no issue with the bank or my bank account number that is directly attached to the loan account. 

Here is my payment history : XX/XX/23 : payment reversal of {$500.00} XX/XX/23 : payment of {$500.00} XX/XX/23 : payment reversal of {$500.00} XX/XX/23 : payment of {$500.00} XX/XX/23 : payment reversal of {$500.00} XX/XX/23 : payment of {$500.00} I was never notified of the payment reversals, so I was unaware until recently that I have """" not been making payments ''. I believe this is extremely unethical behavior on Aidvantage 's part. Now they have been able to gather more interest from me without my knowledge and now it is too late. I hope this is investigated further, as I have read in many forums that others have been having the exact same issue.","","Maximus Education, LLC dba Aidvantage","WA","XXXXX","","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8105929,2024

I called the phone number but all they have is an automated system. I asked to speak to an agent to find out why I have an overdue amount, since I've been set up on autopay for years. The robot transferred me to an """" agent '', but there was no sound. After 4 minutes it gave me a survey asking how satisfied I was. I called back in and got the same response. The robot tried to get me to pay on the phone but said I owe ~ {$250.00}. Which is it? This bot could not explain why, since it is only set up to take payments. 

I tried to get into my account online but don't remember which password I used. So I filled out the """" forgot my password '' form and didn't receive any supposed email with a temporary password until 24 hours later, the same amount of time that the temp password is set to expire. I tried logging in to change my password with the temporary password but it just said """" an error occurred ''. This happened on multiple attempts. 

What the XXXX. I'm also confused by the labeling of these documents. The letter I received is from """" Aidvantage '', but when I call the phone number it says XXXX.
