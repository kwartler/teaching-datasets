2023-12-30,"Credit card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem with a purchase shown on your statement","Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement","I applied for Priceline VIP Reward Visa Card and became a VIP member to book car rental and hotel room for XXXX XXXX trip on XX/XX/XXXX & XXXX, XXXX  with Priceline VIP Reward Visa Card. 
Per VIP terms, Priceline would provide best price guarantee or refund the difference when I found the cheaper price from other suppliers. 
I have two disputes with Priceline for """" Best Price Guarantee ''. 
1. In the evening of XX/XX/2023, I used Priceline VIP Reward Visa Card booking 5 days ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/2023 ) car rental in XXXX XXXX via Priceline by total {$300.00}. 
In the morning of XX/XX/, I found the cheaper price for car rental from another supplier, whose total price for 5 days ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX  ) was only XXXX. The difference is {$87.00}. So, I immediately called Priceline and filled out request for refund on Priceline 's website. But, Priceline refused my refund request without a good reason. 
2. In the morning of XX/XX/, I used Priceline VIP Reward Visa Card booking 3 nights ( XXXX XXXX check in -- XXXX XXXX check out at XXXX XXXX  ) for one guest room at the XXXX XXXX, XXXX & XXXX XXXX. Priceline by total {$210.00}. 
Only a few hours later, I found the cheaper price for the same hotel and the same room provided by another supplier, whose price was total {$140.00}. The difference is {$63.00}. So, I immediately called Priceline and filled out request for refund on Priceline 's website. But, Priceline refused my refund request without a good reason, either. 
On XX/XX/2023, I disputed with Priceline a few times to request total refund {$150.00}. But, Priceline refused my refund requests by bad reasons. 
Since XX/XX/2023, I have been requesting my refunds from Priceline. Around end of XXXX and early of XXXX, XXXX, I sent my dispute to Priceline VIP Reward Visa Card company ( Barclays Bank ) to request total {$150.00} refund. But, Priceline VIP Reward Visa Card company ( Barclays Bank ) answered me that I had used the service. So, no refund to me. 
On XX/XX/2023, I faxed and mailed my refund request with the factual evidence to Priceline VIP Reward Visa Card company ( Barclays Bank ) again. But, Priceline VIP Reward Visa Card company ( Barclays Bank ) refused my request with different reasons. 
( 1 ) Insufficient evidence that the merchant has violated the invoice/contract 's terms or conditions.

( 2 ) We were not provided with sufficient evidence that the merchant has agreed to refund the account.

( 3 ) We are outside of the permitted timeframes to continue the claim through the dispute process.

( 4 ) We encourage you to continue to pursue credit by contacting the merchant directly, unfortunately, we can not assist you further with this issue.

The Priceline VIP Reward Visa Card company ( Barclays Bank ) ignored and distorted the facts that the merchant has not violated the invoice/contract 's terms or conditions. The VIP terms clearly state that Priceline would provide best price guarantee for VIP member. Otherwise, Priceline will refund the difference. The VIP terms have been posting on Priceline website. 
Moreover, Priceline are owned by Priceline VIP Reward Visa Card company ( Barclays Bank ). So, it's not strange for Priceline VIP Reward Visa Card company ( Barclays Bank ) always denied my refund request.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","KS","66614","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-30,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8076503,2023

During the ticket purchasing, there was an option to apply for credit card and receive a {$200.00} credit on the flight I was purchasing. 

In the process of doing this, the Barclay/JetBlue site crashed. I ended up booking the flight and getting the credit card BUT the flight was not charged to this new BarclayCard. 

I immediately called back to BarclayCard and they said there was nothing they could do. Out of time, I just gave up in frustration, but the representative told me not to worry that I could get the {$200.00} by spending anytime on the card. Although I can not verify this, the representative acknowledged the crash on the website- it was down for XXXX minutes or so. 

Several months go by, I am charged the {$100.00} annual fee. 

As the end of year approached, this card has now COST me {$100.00}. I try to get back some semblance of value from this card but I was told that the {$200.00} would need to be used within the first 90 days. Well, first off, I was TRYING to use in the first 90 days by booking the flight. BarclayCard should have been able to rectify this issue. Second, I was never informed that there was a 90 day limit. I would have simply cancelled card at the time of purchase.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","CA","94611","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-28,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",8067352,2023

I am currently facing an interest rate of 29.99 %, the highest among all my credit cards. Despite multiple attempts to negotiate the APR with the company, I have encountered no success. 

Despite my consistent efforts to make payments, I recently faced a reduction in my credit limit, resulting in a sudden XXXX drop in my credit score.

In addition, I have encountered several issues, including excessive fees, inconsistent interest rates, and inadequate customer service. In the year 2023 alone, I incurred {$98.00} in return payment fees and an astonishing {$350.00} in interest rate charges. 

As of my statement balance on XX/XX/, which was {$1600.00}, I have diligently reduced my outstanding balance to {$590.00}. 

I am seeking your assistance in conducting a prompt investigation into these matters to ensure fair and transparent financial practices. Your attention to this urgent issue is greatly appreciated.

In my capacity as a conscientious and law-abiding consumer, I decided to submit an application for a second Barclays credit card, motivated by the aforementioned enticing offer. I did not need another credit card ; Im retired and I travel so XXXX miles would be amazing. Keep in mind, I already have another Barclays personal credit card. They were using my existing account to bait and switch with this offer. 
Regrettably, I have yet to see the fulfillment of the promised frequent flyer miles in my account. Furthermore, I have not received a refund for the {$95.00} annual fee that was levied, subsequent to my expenditure of {$2000.00} on the card. My primary concern pertains to the non-fulfillment of the promised miles, which I had been anticipating with eagerness. 
When I engaged with the customer support division in an attempt to address this issue, the response I received was notably disheartening. I received a brief, two-sentence letter that effectively communicated their unwillingness or inability to rectify the matter in an amicable manner. This response gave the impression of a lack of commitment towards resolving the matter in good faith. 
In light of this unsatisfactory experience, I have opted to terminate my credit card account with Barclays. Additionally, I am pursuing a formal complaint through your esteemed office due to concerns that deceptive practices may have been employed in soliciting funds from unsuspecting consumers. 

It is indeed disheartening to find myself embroiled in this predicament, and I earnestly implore your organization to take prompt corrective measures. Enclosed herewith, please find an invoice detailing the annual fee that was charged to me, for which I expect full restitution. 
I have documentation proving that they baited me.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","CO","808XX","Older American","Consent provided","Web",2023-10-10,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7675373,2023

2023-12-04,"Credit card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem with a purchase shown on your statement","Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement","I filed a dispute with Barclays in XXXX for a charge on XX/XX/2023 for {$2700.00} because the plumber failed to complete a project. Specifically, this is my original dispute message to Barclays : A tenant reported sewer smell in the building. XXXX the plumber went out, told me the issue and said he'd come back to fix them. He sent me the bill after a few days with pictures of the problematic parts, I thought everything was resolved. However, the tenant reported the issue persisted. I thought it's more of a warranty issue. My property manager and I have been contacted him for weeks but we couldn't get him out to finish the job and later were not able to get in touch with him. The tenants were threatening to escalate, so we have to get another plumber, turns out the toilet was not replaced, the pipe was not fixed, the bathtub fixture was not replaced. Those were all listed in the invoice and I need to pay another plumber to fix essentially most if not all of the items listed, and potentially escalated actions from tenants. 

After not receiving any updates for months, on XX/XX/2023, Barclays called and left a voicemail, asking me to reply within 2 business days or else the case will be closed. I called within a few hours, they wanted me to fax or mail the invoice of the original plumber, invoice ( s ) of the work to complete the project since the original plumbers departure, and a second opinion letter stating the original plumber did not finish the work, within 48 hours. At that time, I have requested Barclays to provide all supporting documents and correspondence provided by the merchant to me. Due to the tight deadline, I had immediately contacted all the contractors who have involved with the project to see whoever is able to provide the second opinion within the timeframe. Note that at that time, Barclays did not mention the second opinion letter had to be from a licensed plumber. Therefore, one of the contractors who witnessed the entire event was able to provide a letter attesting the original plumber did not finish the project, and we had to hire another plumber to complete the project. 

One day after XXXX request, on XX/XX/2023, I had faxed my supporting documentations. After that, I had not received any updates from Barclays for two weeks. I decided to follow up on XX/XX/2023 to confirm if the XXXX fax was received and the status of the case. I was told by Barclays that the fax was received and the case was still investigating as of XX/XX/2023. 

However, I noticed later that night a rebill amount {$2100.00} was charged on my account on XX/XX/2023. Worrying about the previous phone rep might not had enough permission to see the full status on the case, I decided to send a secure message immediately on XXXX online portal. I got a response shortly after that the secure message system was not able to handle dispute cases. Therefore, I called again on the next day on XX/XX/2023. Barclays had initially told me the case was still investigating with no update. After I have pushed for an explanation on the rebill amount of {$2100.00} on XX/XX/2023, they told me a letter was going to be sent out and they can not disclose the reasoning over the phone until I received the letter. Note that I had yet to receive any supporting documents and correspondence provided by the merchant to Barclays at that point, so I had requested such information again during the call. I have also requested to apply a provisional credit of {$2100.00} that was rebilled on XX/XX/2023 until the case is resolved, I was told it can only be done after I received the letter. 

I had finally received the letter on XX/XX/2023, dating on XX/XX/2023, stating the following reasons : We were not provided with proof that the merchant agreed to refund the credit card account. 
We were not provided with a valid second opinion as previously requested. 

I was never told to provide the first piece of proof, and I had already provided a second opinion letter within a calendar day, and confirmed by Barclays that they had received it. The letter also mentioned that I had to contest the case within 10 days of receiving the letter. Therefore, I called immediately on XX/XX/2023 upon receiving the letter. At that time, I was told the second opinion letter had to be from a licensed plumber, which I was never told before, and I had to provide that within XXXX hours of this call. I mentioned it will be a challenge to get that letter from a licensed plumber, I was then allowed to provide such letter until next Friday ( XX/XX/2023 ). I was also assured that the case was still open, and since I had contacted Barclays, the case will not be closed until the deadline of XX/XX/2023. I had again requested to apply a provisional credit of {$2100.00} that was rebilled on XX/XX/2023 until the case is resolved, I was told they will send in that request only after I have submitted the documents. 

Since I didnt have the direct number of the plumber, I had to contact the office of the plumbing company, and the master plumber was on vacation so it takes a few days to get permission from him. Nonetheless, I had stressed the importance to have this promptly, I was able to obtain the letter XXXX business days later on XX/XX/2023. I had immediately faxed it to Barclays and called after a few hours to confirm if the fax was received. I was told that faxes take XXXX hours to receive, but they had already closed my case on XX/XX/2023, 15 days after the XX/XX/2023. I believe the representative I talked to on XX/XX/2023 did not take any necessary steps to log our conversation and kept the case open. I was told during that call that the case could only be reopened upon receiving the fax. 

I have called again a day later on XX/XX/2023, I was told the XXXX fax was received. The case will now be reopened since documents were received. I had again requested to apply a provisional credit of {$2100.00} that was rebilled on XX/XX/2023 until the case is resolved, I was told only the investigation team could do this and she had submitted the request. 

After having no updates and no provisional credit for XXXX weeks, I followed up on XX/XX/2023. I was told the case was already closed. Meaning the representatives on XX/XX/2023, XX/XX/2023, and XX/XX/2023 did not take any steps to reopen the case at all. At that point, as a customer, I was not sure if they had able to add any notes to my seemingly closed case. I asked to escalate this case to a supervisor, and I was told I will receive a call within XXXX hours. 

I received a missed call from a Barclays supervisor on XX/XX/2023. However, the voicemail did not leave any direct call back number or a number that leads to the escalated department. In the voicemail, she said I may return the call at the standard XXXX number. Therefore, I had to call again and went thru the entire escalation process again to ask and for a supervisor call back. During this call, Barclays continued to change the goal post. The agent said they were unable to accept the latest second opinion letter because it was not in a formal business letter head which was not previously communicated by any of the XXXX previous agents. 

The supervisor called in the morning despite I requested for a call back at a different hour on XX/XX/2023. She acknowledged my point that the requirements were not specified regarding the second opinion letter on the original request ( it had to be a licensed plumber from the call on XX/XX/2023 ) and the follow-up request ( the letter had to be in a company letterhead from the call on XX/XX/2023 ). I went into great details on the exact specification on this second opinion letter in hope that Barclays doesnt change the goal post on me again. She was not able to confirm what information was needed in the letterhead ; she did not even answer the question of if company name, address, and phone numbers were required. She just said it just needs to be in a company letterhead, suggesting to me that theres no written standard for this requirement or if this was just a requirement made up by the previous agent on the fly and the subsequent agents had to follow thru with that. While inquiring in details on exactly what else were required from me to reopen this case, she said a statement was required on the fax requesting the case to reopen, which was never disclosed to me in the previous three calls.

I had faxed the revised second opinion letter with company letterhead and a cover letter stating this is a formal request to reopen this dispute case on XX/XX/2023. I had also made clear again that if any part of my dispute was rejected, I would like to request for a detailed itemized breakdown of the {$2100.00} line ( multiple repairs ) provided in the merchants invoice on exactly which line item was completed and could be supported with proof and which line item was not completed nor finished. 

Since I didnt see any provisional credit applied to my account for another week, I called Barclays XXXX XX/XX/2023, I was told the XXXX fax was received. The rep, similar to the previous experience, did not have any updates nor had more information regarding to my request of applying the provisional credit of {$2100.00} until the case is resolved. Therefore, I have requested for a supervisor to call back. Similar to last time, I had requested a call back in the afternoon and was assured that a call back number will be provided in case I did not pick up the phone on time. 

I received the call back in the morning, different than the requested call back time similar to last time, on XX/XX/2023. Unfortunately, I was not able to pick up the call at that time, and the voicemail did not leave any direct call back number. Similar to the previous experience, I had to call the general number again and went thru the entire escalation process again. 

A Barclays supervisor was able to call me back on XX/XX/2023, ensured to me the case was reopened and informed me the new case number. I was told again that the provisional credit of {$2100.00} will be requested. 

I called Barclays to ask for an update on XX/XX/2023. The rep said theres no update at this point but she said interest rate will not be charged for the disputed amount of {$2100.00}. Since there were no indication online, in the statement, or a separate notification letter regarding this, I requested for something in writing. The rep was not able to provide anything in writing other than this verbal confirmation, without mentioning any an end date for this interest rate waiver. 

On XX/XX/2023, I received letter dated XX/XX/2023, saying my claim is declined again due to : Merchant has not violated the terms and conditions of the contract Insufficient proof of cancellation We were not provided with sufficient proof that the merchant has agreed to refund the account For the first point, since Barclays did not mention that the second opinion letter is insufficient, I expected Barclays has accepted this document. The second opinion letter has clearly stated that the merchant did not fully complete the project, clearly a violation of the terms and conditions of the invoice/contract. 

On the second point, given that the merchant did not respond to any of communications at all until this date, this was a cancellation on his part. With this, the cancellation proof of burden should not be on me as I always intended for the merchant to complete the project in a timely manner, and the project was halted for a significant amount of time, just to wait for him to respond and eventually get back to the site and finish the project. 

Lastly, I had repeatedly requesting Barclays to provide me with all supporting documentations provided by the merchant, which Barclays had failed to provide as of this date, unless the two-page invoice from XX/XX/2023 ( which I have also provided to Barclays ) XXXX the only time and everything the merchant provided ( as in, no additional correspondence nor letter was provided by the merchant ). If that was the case, it meant the merchant had failed to explained the fact that the project was not finished according to the second opinion letter, did not provide a detailed itemized breakdown of the {$2100.00} line ( multiple repairs ) provided in the merchants invoice, and did not provide proof on exactly which line item was completed. When the merchant did not respond or provide with an agreement to Barclays to refund the account, it should not mean the customer had to seek out directly to the merchant for such agreement as the core of this dispute was due to the Merchants lack of response both physically and over all communications method.

Given that Barclays has promised that zero liability should be bear by the customer in these situations and this case has extremely strong evidence to show that the merchant did not finish the work. I think it is unfair for Barclays to decline this claim.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","TX","75025","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7942565,2023

I made a long term payment plan at $ XXXX  monthly till it was paid off. I had been paying that for over a year when I went to make my payment in XX/XX/2023 they said my account was transferred to XXXX XXXX and could not take my payment. I called XXXX XXXX and they had no record of me so I called back Barclays and they said it takes time. In XXXX I got notification that my account was delinquent from Barclays and after calls on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX they said they could take a payment for the card while it was still transitioning to XXXX XXXX to bring my account current. I was taken out of the long term payment program for missed payments when I was able to make those payments and they were reported as missed through no fault of my own. I contacted a lawyer who wrote a letter that I be reinstated into the payment program and have heard nothing. At this point in time I have made countless phone calls to Barclays and have not found one person who understands what has happened and there has been no effort to resolve this. I have confirmed with XXXX XXXX that they do not have my account and Barclays continues to send me emails as to payment reminders, sometimes Im able to make the payment easy albeit now a high interest charge and sometimes I still have to deal with Barclays saying they cant accept my payment. I am denied online access because my account is closed, however I have a balance that I am paying off. The email for payment just has the date and minimum payment due. This has been a frustrating situation that has affected my credit score and they should be able to see that my account was not transferred and allowed to make payments easily.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","NJ","08857","","Consent provided","Web",2023-08-21,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7436273,2023

Barclays did not provide me ( 1 ) 30 days ' written notice of its intent to terminate the Account or ( 2 ) a statement of specific reasons for that action, both of which are required under federal law. Barclays thereafter failed and refused to transfer to my XXXX XXXX AAdvantage account both the Award miles ( miles ) and the Loyalty Points ( points ) I had earned. 

Barclays actions violate the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( 15 U.S.C. section 1691 ( d ) ), Regulation B ( 12 C.F.R. section 1002.9 ( a ) ), and constitute Unfair Competition ( Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act ( CUTPA ) ), conversion and breach of contract/breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. 

When Barclays closed the aforementioned credit card account, I had previously earned two ( 2 ) miles and one ( 1 ) point for each dollar spent. I would have earned an additional XXXX miles and XXXX points based on my spending in the billing period with a XX/XX/2022 statement closing date. I plainly have a right to those miles and points. Barclays nonetheless failed to transfer those miles and points to my XXXX XXXX account as it had done for the prior nine ( 9 ) months. Instead, it purported to forfeit those miles and points based on some internal policy which it had not provided to me. By confiscating my miles and points and preventing me from earning additional miles and points, Barclays improperly interfered with my right to my miles and points. Since those miles and points have substantial value to me they served as the basis for Barclays inducing me to obtain and use its credit card I was damaged as a result of Barclays conduct. Barclays justification for the forfeiture is immaterial under the law. Having deprived me of my miles and points, Barclays motive is not relevant. Barclays is strictly liable for conversion.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","CT","06511","","Consent provided","Web",2023-09-01,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7481944,2023

I received a text alert for the fourth and discovered the others ( for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, all to the same company ) when I opened my online account. I reported all four immediately. Within the next few days Barclays reversed the charges twice. When I tried to pay my XXXX legitimate charges of XXXX, I could not because the card had been stopped, and the erroneous credit wiped out the legitimate purchases. I tried to pay what I knew I owed online and was repeatedly denied. Over the next few weeks I made dozens of phone calls, some of which were dropped by the representative, others that made me wait over an hour for a representative to pick up, to try to pay my bill and get the duplicate credit removed. Barclays solution was to offer me a check refund of the remaining credit which I agreed to and put in escrow. Meanwhile I could not pay my {$120.00} XXXX bill as well. I was unable to pay anything until the XXXX bill, when I paid the few charges I made after receiving my new card. In XXXX the fraudulent charges reappeared. Although no representatives have been able to explain why themselves, after several more calls I figured out that Barclays is trying to claw back the legitimate purchases that were wiped out by their erroneous credit and the amount of the refund check. I asked for an accurate bill reflecting this so that I would not be paying the fraudulent charges. Today I received a letter referencing my """" credit report dispute '' and that Barclays is amending their report to credit agencies. I have no idea what is in my credit report and never disputed it. I just want an accurate bill and I do not want to pay fraudulent charges that Barclays already acknowledged I do not owe. Today I mailed Barclays three separate checks, for the two months activity I legitimately owe, and for the escrow amount, which they should receive well before the XXXX due date.

On XX/XX/2023, multiple account email notifications were received that reported : 1 ) {$900.00} had posted to the account 2 ) Six ( 6 ) transactions had posted to the account These transactions were fraudulent. When I saw these email notifications, I immediately logged into the Barclay XXXX website and locked the credit card on XX/XX/2023 and received an email notification to confirm that the card had been locked. I then began the process of notifying Barclay, the vendors listed in the transactions, and the XXXX XXXX Police Department about the fraudulent activity.

I submitted an appeal with Barclay on XX/XX/2023 over the phone, where they verified that the address used in this transaction is not and has never been associated with me or my account.

I was told that a decision would be made in 7-10 days. Well after 10 days had passed, on XX/XX/2023, I called Barclay to verify the state of the appeal and was told it would take another 7-10 days, which would require me to pay the fraudulent charge due to the statement due date. 

I think Barclay is intentionally dragging this out to force me to pay the charge or ruin my credit, at which point they'll use the payment to conclude that the charge is not fraudulent even though it is.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","TX","78254","Older American, Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2023-05-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6932245,2023

All details attached. 

Barclays bank credit card ( mastercard ) gave up on retrieving a disputed amount of {$1.00}, XXXX. XXXX from a travel agency called XXXX. Please see their final letter attached. Barclays bank is now asking me to repay all that amount, I believe I shouldnt have to pay that money, XXXX should send the refund of the money because they didnt use the money for what I paid for, as explained below. I have attached all relevant documents I have. 
On Friday XX/XX/, I urgently purchased a plane ticket for my daughter, XXXX XXXX from XXXX, XXXX XXXX to XXXX, urgently because the XXXX XXXX XXXX asked me to expedite the process to meet the criteria for her situation. In this case, I unintentionally paid twice with Barclays credit card around the same time to two different travel agencies, XXXX, and XXXX. Only one of the payments was received by the airline from XXXX, per airline representative. Now Im fighting to retrieve the other payment from XXXX  but they keep rejecting my call and Barclays wont help either. How did this happen, all explained below. 
I made my first payment to XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX, and they gave me the booking # XXXX, ticket # XXXX ( also confirmed later by XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XX/XX/ ). ( Please see attached print-out proof of payment, and if necessary, you can also confirm that with XXXX XXXXXXXX ) XXXX Some hours later after my first payment on the same dayXX/XX/XXXX, I called the same number to confirm whether the transaction had been processed successfully. This second call unfortunately, happened to be picked up by XXXX. I didnt know that this agent talking to me was from a different company. I asked him to check the status of my purchase, I gave him all my information he checked the system and said to me that it didnt process and that he can help me get a plane ticket for my daughter. 
I asked him if its not going to be a problem of double payment, he said not at all. Then I paid XXXX to him, name XXXX per his request. He sent me a booking # XXXX. ( Please see attached booking and payment ). He assured me that he will send the plane ticket after its been generated by the airline. Few days later, I saw on my account XXXX pending payments. XXXX XXXX representative said to me that the payment was done by XXXX XXXX, no record of XXXX. Although the XXXX cancellation window was over ( while waiting for the ticket # from them ) at that time, I still tried to reach XXXX but each time we start talking about what happened, I get disconnected ( they hung up on me ). 
I called Barclays bank to dispute the charges, after several back-and-forth discussion about the issue, they said I must write a formal letter to dispute the charge. Barclays bank, also decided to send me a new replacement card to avoid or mitigate any fraud. That is why the attached receipt shows the previous credit card instead of the current card number. On XX/XX/ I wrote a letter to Barclays bank XXXX department to file a dispute. During my follow up calls to the bank, they assured me that they will do everything in their power to retrieve the money back but on XX/XX/, I received a letter datedXX/XX/XXXX from the bank stating that they couldnt help me with this matter, adding that the XXXX will remain on my credit balance to pay back the money to them. On Monday XX/XX/, I called the bank and talked to XXXX XXXX, he reinstated that I am responsible for the money because of insufficient proof of contract and cancellation. 
During our phone conversation with XXXX, I asked if I did anything wrong by paying before service, he said, No. I added that for all online transactions, everybody pays first before service. If the product is not received or if the service is not provided, then a refund must be made. I said this is the expected role of the bank to make sure that the refund is processed back to their clients account. I added that I XXXX for XXXX made a payment, let him provide a proof/receipt of payment to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX agreed with me on that explanation and my expectation from them, but he still says I must pay the money back.

On XX/XX/2023, my wife and I with the help of our daughter, XXXX helped open a savings account with Barclays Bank. One of the features we liked about Barclays was their mobile deposit feature since we are both XXXX. We deposited my XXXX Check for {$1800.00} and two other cashiers checks for {$88.00} and {$680.00} exclusively. All the deposits were accepted and cleared but we were told that the funds would not be available until the XXXX of XX/XX/2023. We found this very unusual because normally a government check and a cashiers check from another major bank have guarantees on them. But we waited patiently. They did not offer an ATM nor Debit card for their savings account to give us access to our funds. The only option they provided was to link our account with an external bank account. Unfortunately, we did not have another bank to link to. We did have a XXXX account, which has worked for us tremendously. Barclays required a routing number and an account number from XXXX. We have a debit card with XXXX which was very convenient for us. Most banks would prefer using your debit card for payments and transfers. Again, Barclays Bank did not have that option. We only knew the account number of our XXXX XXXX account, but not the routing number. Our daughter looked it up on the internet and discovered that our XXXX XXXX was serviced by XXXX XXXX. We provided our daughter 's routing number and forwarded it to Barclays Bank along with our XXXX account. Thereafter, we were told by Barclay that it would take 3 to 5 business days to verify the external account. We were livid! It takes XXXX less than a day to verify bank accounts. So, we patiently waited again. The following day we received an email from Barclays stating that they could not verify the account and would require a bank statement of the account. We contacted XXXX, which provided us with a Savings Statement from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/2023, and forwarded it to Barclays. A couple of days later, again we received an email from Barclays stating that they require a bank statement from XXXX XXXX  and not XXXX. We never said we had an account with XXXX XXXX! Barclays insisted on a bank statement from XXXX XXXX  after we stated that we do not have access to such an account but only through XXXX. These went on for days. Since we could not provide a XXXX XXXX  statement, they escalated our predicament to fraud and required us to provide a copy of our drivers license and social security card. We did as instructed. We kept calling to verify receipt of our documents. A couple of days later, not bothering to return our phone calls, we instead receive an email stating that our account has been suspended until further notice. We contacted a XXXX Manager and asked if we could do a three-way call with Barclays to verify our account, but Barclays refused to accept the call. We tried to call again and the receptionist that answered the call stated that our account would be closed, and the funds would be sent back to the original issuer! This act is a total violation of our rights as a consumer and as a bank customer in violation of compliance with the terms and conditions of our agreement which requires them to have full disclosure of the status of our account upon request and refusing to communicate with us upon contact and never replied back to our calls or email and refusing to release our funds.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","CA","94546","Older American","Consent provided","Web",2023-05-02,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6913235,2023

I applied for the card over a competitor of Barclays ( who also offered a card with AAdvantage miles ) because of the bonus offer that was made and I accepted. 

I applied on XX/XX/23, but Barclays delayed both the approval and sending the card well beyond anything I have experienced. I only got the card in the mail on XX/XX/23 -- over a month since I applied, and, I was told it was approved in early in XXXX when I called to inquire. 

Since I knew it was approved in early XXXX, I knew I had until the end of XXXX ( XXXX being a short month ) to make a purchase. 

I made a purchase on XX/XX/XXXX, which posted on XX/XX/XXXX. Even if my application was finally approved on XX/XX/XXXX ( which would have been the earliest date of approval based on Barclays saying early XXXX when I called ), the transaction posted on the XXXX day ( if both days are included ), and XXXX day since I had received the card and activated it. 

The activation date is arguably relevant to the opening date, as the only way I was allowed to use my card was to agree to additional terms online from Barclays. If I refused to agree to these terms not in the application, and governing general card usage, it would be hard to argue the account was fully opened until I agreed to the additional terms Barclays required. 

I realize I was cutting it a bit short, but I still completed the requirements for the XXXX bonus miles in time. I am guessing there is a flaw in Barclays system which failed to account for the shorter month of XXXX, or an error in the sending of a card well after I applied which did not all in good-faith for 90 days if they largely delayed sending me a card for weeks on end. 

I am requesting the XXXX bonus miles given the large timing anomalies regarding the approval/delivering of the card and the ambiguity on what constitutes opening of the card when all other card issuers seem to stick with approval ( as well as give additional grace period days or deliver the card in a faster timeframe.

2023-04-27,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Credit reporting","Incorrect information on your report","Account status incorrect","Barclays reported my XX/XX/XXXX payment as being 30-days past due. The delinquent account showing on my credit report fir XX/XX/XXXX was due to XXXX pandemic and I intend to make up the payments as soon as I could, and the payments were made up with the account becoming current. At the time of the due payment my state and city had a 'shelter in place ' due to quarantining myself due to XXXX symptoms. 

Section 4021 : Credit Protection During XXXX The CARES Act amends the FCRAs duties on furnishers during the XXXX crisis in a significant way. If a furnisher makes an accommodation with respect to XXXX or more payments on a credit obligation or account of a consumer, and the consumer makes the payments or is not required to make one or more payments pursuant to the accommodation, then the furnisher must report such credit obligation or account as current during the period of the accommodation. Importantly, this means that furnishers should not report an affected account using forbearance coding during the accommodation period and, instead, should report that account as current. 
If the account was delinquent prior to the accommodation, then the furnisher must report the account as the status reported prior to the accommodation until the account is brought current. 
An accommodation is defined as relief granted to a consumer who is affected by XXXX during the covered period. And, according to Section 4021 ( F ) ( i ) ( II ), the covered period is the period beginning on XX/XX/XXXX, and ending on 120 days after the XXXX national emergency is terminated which was XX/XX/XXXX. The Act requires lenders to report to credit bureaus that consumers are current on their loans if consumers have sought relief from their lenders due to the pandemic. The Bureaus statement informs lenders they must comply with the CARES Act. The Bureaus statement also encourages lenders to continue to voluntarily provide payment relief to consumers and to report accurate information to credit bureaus relating to this relief. The continuation of reporting such accurate payment information produces substantial benefits for consumers, users of consumer reports, and the economy as a whole. If a consumer is able to obtain a covered accommodation, the CARES Act offers the following protections : If the consumer was current on an obligation at the time of an accommodation approval, the account must be reported to CRAs as current if the consumer is complying with the accommodation agreement. 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ( F ) ( ii ) ( I ).

If the consumer was already delinquent when the consumer received the accommodation, but complies with the accommodation agreement, the creditor or other furnisher must report the same delinquency status during the accommodation period. 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ( F ) ( ii ) ( II ) ( aa ). The CARES Act provision is considered in pari materia with the standard for accuracy under the reinvestigation requirements of CRA-referred disputes under section 1681s-2 ( b ). Therefore, the CARES Act provision informs those reinvestigation duties.

Indeed, several courts note the interplay between furnisher duties found in subsections 1681s-2 ( a ) and 1681s-2 ( b ). See NCLCs Fair Credit Reporting 6.10.5. Most notably is the Fourth Circuit in Saunders v. Branch Banking & Trust Co. of Virginia, 526 F.3d 142, 150 ( 4th Cir. 2008 ) : The first subsection, 1681s-2 ( a ), provides that furnishers have a general duty to provide accurate and complete information ; the next subsection, 1681s-2 ( b ), imposes an obligation to review the previously disclosed information and report whether it was incomplete or inaccurate upon receipt of a notice of dispute from a CRA. The second subsection thus requires furnishers to review their prior report for accuracy and completeness ; it does not set forth specific requirements as to what information must be reported, because these requirements have already been set forth in the first subsection.

As stated by one court summarizing the Saunders jurisprudence, If a furnisher has a duty to report information under the subsection ( a ) standard, that information must also be covered by the subsection ( b ) duty to investigate and correct incomplete or inaccurate information. Shames-Yeakel v. Citizens Fin. Bank, 677 F. Supp. 2d 994, 1005 ( N.D.

The Customer Service XXXX with whom I spoke ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX  stated that the inconsistency could not be explained. My complaint is that the interest charged is inconsistent with the closing date, therefore not an accurate date/interest charged amount as their web site posts, and what the Barclays Bank internal systems lists . Two sets of books is a practice not consistent with published financial statutes. Please advise.

2023-02-04,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem with a purchase shown on your statement","Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card","At some point in XXXX 2022, my AA Advantage Aviator Red Mastercard account issued by Barclays had the address changed without my permission. Shortly thereafter, two charges for {$5000.00} each ( {$10000.00} total ) and then another for {$2100.00} were made in XXXX 2022. Those charges were paid directly from my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account. However, because the statements were not going to my house but instead to the address provided by the fraudster, I had no knowledge of the theft. 

At some point in XXXX 2022, Barclays issued a credit card with a different number under my legitimate account to a fraudulent authorized user. Under no circumstances did I request or provide information allowing an authorized user to be added. The fraudulent authorized user is XXXX XXXX and the address she is associated with is the same address my account was changed to in XXXX 2022. XXXX then attempted to add XXXX XXXX as another authorized user but was denied. I opened a formal complaint with Barclay in XXXX 2022 after I was denied a car loan due to delinquencies on my credit report, which were caused by XXXX 's theft. 

I spoke with Barclays multiple times inquiring about the investigation and the securities department at Barclays casually mentioned XXXX 's name stating she is a """" known name '' to them. During the fraud at Barclays, XXXX also falsely acquired my XXXX card information and stole close to {$40000.00}. I have finally been reimbursed for those debits through XXXX but Barclays is not reimbursing me. It is important to note that XXXX also funneled monies to my credit cards from other banks, including XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX would make direct payments from these banks and then use the payments to make cash advances at XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Texas and XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Texas. XXXX has defrauded customers of each of these banks and used my Advantage Aviator Red Mastercard to funnel the funds to herself. I insisted Barclays give me all the information, including transcripts, indicating how XXXX was able to make herself an authorized user. Barclays nonchalantly indicated XXXX had my information and was approved as a user. Truly, the largest disservice besides the theft is that each time I speak to Barclays, I have to jump through hoops and security authorizations before Barclays will have a discussion with me yet a known fraudster was able to quite easily make themselves an authorized user. Barclays securities department is clearly lacking the ability to protect its customers. 

In XXXX 2022, Barclays sent a letter addressed to XXXX XXXX ( this was the first time XXXX was used but my statements as well as background checks have the name XXXX XXXX ) to my home address. The letter stated the primary account was closed due to suspicious activity and pending further investigation. This was the same account I reported to Barclays in XXXX 2022. Again, this is evidence of the incompetence within Barclays organization that they are now addressing a letter to me using the fraudster 's name. 

Barclays found fraudulent activity on my account and have not made any attempt to resolve the issue. Instead, I spend countless hours initiating conversations with them that are not helpful.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","NC","28031","Older American","Consent provided","Web",2023-02-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6525162,2023

A police officer came and made a report about XXXX minutes later. Once the police left, I immediately notified all of my credit cards. Upon talking to my Old Navy Credit Card, sponsored by Barclay 's, I was informed someone had just made a puchase for {$44.00} at a mall about 15 minutes away. I was told it would go into review and the charge would be removed from my account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter saying that because chip card technology was used it must have been in my possession and the charge was valid and being put back on my account. 

At that point I called the number on the letter and was given an ID number, case number, and an address to send by regular mail a letter and a copy of the police report. They did not give any option to submit electronically. So, I immediately put a letter with the police report in the mail as directed. 

I just received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that because I did not provide proof, they are reinstating the charge plus interest. 

I called today and was told their system wasn't working and they can't help me, I should call back some other time. 

I have to paperwork to prove the card was not in my possession at the time. It's very easy for them to state they didn't receive if my only option is snail mail.

I chose this date to ensure there would be enough time to process the transfer of funds. 

For this amount, I was assessed a balance transfer fee of {$200.00} ( 4 % ). The total amount I was to owe Barclays was {$5200.00}. 

The following week, I received a letter in the mail from Barclays stating that they """" could not process '' my balance transfer request due to """" insufficient funds. '' Upon reading further, the letter stated that a balance transfer of XXXX XXXX XXXX was attempted and rejected. This was obviously their error as all of my confirmations and documentation within the Barclays website reflected the correct request of {$5000.00}. 

On Tuesday, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( later due to the holiday ), I once again initiated a balance transfer to pay off my car loan at XXXX ; however, at this time, due to daily accrued interest my payoff had increased to {$5000.00}. This greater amount also triggered a higher balance transfer fee of {$200.00} for a total of {$5200.00}. 

This amount is {$8.00} more and I was financially penalized by Barclay 's error in processing my initial request. On XXXX XXXX I called into the Barclay 's Customer Service number at XXXX to inform them of this problem and request a courtesy credit in the amount of {$8.00}. I only wanted to be made """" whole.

I am highly disappointed that XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to inform me of my outstanding auto loan balance, which resulted in delinquencies on my account. My XXXX XXXX XXXX Adjuster/Claims Resolution Representative, XXXX XXXX XXXX informed me that I would have the option to add the remaining balance to my new auto loan once the claim was settled. However, I did not receive any notification to make a payment on the account to prevent any delinquencies from occurring. As a result, my credit score has been negatively affected, which has brought me further financial distress. 

Furthermore, Despite my efforts to stay current on my payments, my credit score has dropped from a XXXX to a XXXX, and I have had 5 missed payments on my credit cards. My income has taken a massive hit since the accident, as my business has only generated {$8000.00} between now and XX/XX/2022, compared to the {$10000.00} a month gross income I was making before the accident. 

The back and neck soreness that I am experiencing has further added to my physical and financial burden. To make matters worse, I was not informed by my insurance company that I was supposed to show up to the arbitration hearing, which they later settled for XXXX XXXX leaning our way which I believed if I was there it would've been 100 %. 

I urge you to take my complaint seriously and to take the necessary steps to rectify this situation. I look forward to hearing back from you with a positive resolution. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","TX","75040","","Consent provided","Web",2023-03-06,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6656697,2023

A fraud investigation was supposedly initiated, my account was closed, and a replacement card with a new number was ordered.

When my initial complaint was filed regarding my inability to make multiple payments from different accounts, I was contacted by someone from Barclay that stated they would look into the matter. I was in fact able to make multiple payments once again ( only over the phone ) from different accounts for a couple months. Last month, when making payments over the phone I was unable to do so and had to schedule payments over the course of multiple days since they only allow two payments a day. By not being able to pay my balance in full on the due date, it caused me to incur interest charges which I don't feel I am responsible for since their system is not allowing me to pay in full. When this happened previously, Barclay waived the interest fees. I have not spoken to them for the current charges as of yet. Either way, I don't have time to waste every month dealing with this issue. 

I would appreciate if this problem with making payment can be resolved once and for all. I would also appreciate if the cfpb does not close out a case without speaking to the complainant first.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","WI","XXXXX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-04-02,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6768575,2023

I have had difficulty with them regarding their charging of interest and penalties which were not valid. Back quite a few months ago, I got an interest charge and penalty charge on my wifes credit card and when checking the statement, I found that the statement had been paid on time. I contacted Barclays and was told that they will often put a charge on the credit card and then, when the payment is received, they will then reverse the charge. I thought at the time that that was bazaar and made no sense. People could mistakenly pay the charge. I called and talked to a supervisor regarding this and she apologized and didn't know why that happened. Then again, several months ago, there was an item that I was to get a credit for. I was told to deduct the charge from my bill since I was not responsible for the charge. I did that but again received interest and penalty charges. I called and they said they would remove the charges. So I deducted the interest and penalty charges from my bill and then, on my next statement I again got interest charges and was told it was because I didn't pay the past interest and penalties. I asked to talk to a supervisor. I then talked to XXXX operator ID XXXX. He told me that my problem was not paying the bill and charges in full and as long as I didn't pay the bill in full even if the charges were not mine, I would continue to receive interest. I told him that I didn't think they should be charging people interest for charges they should need to pay because they werent valid charges. I told him that I was told to deduct these charges. He said that what I was told was not true. He was also rude and said that nobody would've told me that. He said that even though the charges were not valid that I had to pay them and wait till I got a credit for them on the next statement. I told him that was not what I was told. He said he didn't believe that somebody would tell me that. I told him that any credit card that I've ever had and had charges on it that weren't valid and that would be credited that I was told that I was to deduct them from my statement. He said that's not true and credit card companies don't do that. I believe he is wrong. I pointed out to him that if, for example, I as a consumer have something like a {$50.00} charge on my account which was not a valid charge that I had no reason to pay it.

The incorrect utilization amount has caused several negative consequences, affecting both myself and authorized users associated with the account. 

Account Details : Bank Name : Barclays Account Number Ending : XXXX Disputed Information : Inaccurate Utilization Amount : {$3500.00} Explanation of Dispute : Upon reviewing my account statement, I noticed that the utilization amount reported by Barclays is significantly higher than the actual utilization of the account. The reported utilization amount of {$3500.00} does not reflect the true utilization, as the account has been responsibly managed and the actual utilization is significantly lower. 

This inaccuracy has had a detrimental impact on various parties associated with the account, particularly authorized users who have experienced negative consequences due to the inflated utilization amount. This includes potential negative effects on their credit scores and the ability to access credit, despite the utilization being inaccurately reported. 

I have contacted Barclays directly to address this issue, but they have been unresponsive and have not taken any action to rectify the situation. I have also submitted a written dispute to Barclays, providing evidence of the accurate utilization amount, but they have failed to make the necessary corrections. 

I am seeking the assistance of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to intervene in this matter and ensure that Barclays corrects the inaccurate utilization amount on my account. I request that an investigation is conducted to verify the true utilization and that appropriate actions are taken to rectify the reporting error promptly. 

I have attached supporting documentation, including account statements and any other relevant evidence, to substantiate my dispute. If further information or documentation is required, please do not hesitate to contact me. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a prompt resolution. Thank you for your assistance in resolving this dispute and holding Barclays accountable for their inaccurate reporting practices.

I am the primary hold of our GapCard. Gap sent us new cards and had ( unbeknownst to me ) switched from XXXX XXXX to Barclays. We had automatic bill pay set up on XXXX. My wife made some purchases in XXXX and early XXXX of 2022. We never received any bills in the mail. Today I checked on my credit score and found that Barclays had issued a 30 day late payment notice that reduced my credit score by about XXXX points. I hadn't even activated my GapCard until today, and when I did so I found that it was now under Barclays and didn't even have a bank account associated with it for payments yet. So I set all that up and paid it. 

I have been monitoring my credit score because I expect to apply for a mortgage soon, and this will cost me thousands of dollars and be on my credit score for 7 years. How can GapCard get away with switching the primary cardholder to a new bank that is not set up, then never send bills or late notices, then mark me as delinquent. My address was correct in their system, and I had not signed up for electronic delivery. I had every right to expect that the card was still set up for automatic bill pay, and it was the secondary cardholder who made the charges. I hadn't even activated the new card yet. 

I immediately set up auto-pay and paid the bill, and we called Barclays, who are refunding some of the fees, but they have damaged my credit score in a way that will have a material effect on my mortgage rates, while never providing a bill let alone a late notice.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","CA","94606","","Consent provided","Web",2023-03-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6647437,2023

I was expecting that they kept their promise of adding XXXX miles to my account 6-8 weeks after the end of the promotion, but until this day, they've never added anything. 

I reached out to them last week and they simply denied of such a promotion. They said they could not locate it. And when I sent their promotional email to them as the undeniable evidence, they said it was a systematic promotion. Isn't it a promotion a promotion by Barclay US, regardless of how it is generated or sent to the customers? They had baited the customers to use their cards to spend but then they simply ignored their promises to the customers. I am attaching their promotional email along with this message.

They canceled my card, sent me a new one and turned over charges to their fraud department. I was very happy initially. 

The first week of XXXX I received a letter that 2 of the charges were being deemed valid. When I checked my account there were actually 3 charges on the account that the Fraud department stated were valid. All from restaurants I'd never heard of and it was stated I had history with the merchant, XXXX XXXX. I found out the 3 restaurants are in northern California, thousands of miles from me. I've never purchased anything from these establishments. Coincidentally these are the highest charges I'm aware of, that were charged during the XXXX XXXX  XXXX, totally {$200.00}. Over the course of the next 2-3 weeks I attempted on several occasions to get someone to listen to me, that I didn't make these charges. I was told I had to prove I was in XXXX and not in California ordering Chinese food. So I got a letter notarized by neighbor confirming we as a family were in fact home, in XXXX, in a blizzard and that no one was driving or ordering food from California. Sent pictures and wrote a 2 page hand written letter, as I was told it couldn't be typed. Someone could fake that. Faxed it all over to the fraud department. I did all of these things and received a notice today, XXXX that the charges were reinstated and were determined to be valid, despite all that I sent in. It is absolutely mind boggling. 

I canceled my card today. I am loosing money that was earned towards my daughter 's college fund. I was a customer with Barclays for over 10 years and averaged {$4000.00} - {$5000.00} a month in charges, and I paid pretty much at 30 days. If I made these charges, I would have paid them. I wouldn't haggle over {$200.00}. But NO ONE would listen to me or be reasonable. Barclay 's fraud department picked 3 of the highest charges ( more were on the original list ) and said you have to pay these. No reasoning as to why other cheaper charges were determined to be fraudulent and these 3 were reinstated. Other than the very incorrect statement of """" I had history with the merchants ''. I've NEVER heard of these restaurants or ordered from them. The fraud department apparently gets to make ridiculous determinations and stick to them. I asked for a manager to call me and was told a manager wasn't available. I could only leave a message and someone would call me back in 7-10 days. Ridiculous. And I never heard from anyone! 

There is {$330.00} left to pay on my account. Of that, {$120.00} are charges we made and we will pay that amount. I refuse to pay the {$200.00}, the total of the fraudulent charges. Barclay 's will no doubt put me into collections and lower my credit score. But I will not pay for something I didn't charge. Their fraud department is over-reaching to say the least.

In my dispute, I provided clear evidence and explanations as to why the reported information was inaccurate and incomplete. Despite my efforts, Barclays Bank Delaware failed to respond within the required time frame, which is a direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

I have been unable to obtain credit, loans, and other financial services due to the inaccurate and incomplete information on my credit report.

I did so, and you will see there were a few emails from them after that through XXXX. I have not received email communication from them since XXXX. 
This month, I went to log into my account as my XXXX kids are now in college and want to transfer the college savings account to pay for college. Upon logging in, I received a message ( see one of the attached screenshots ) that my account was closed due to 30 months of inactivity and that if I clicked the button they would reactivate my account in the amount of {$2100.00}. Since there is no other way to communicate with them other than email, I immediately emailed them requesting assistance with my missing funds and remaining balance. They created a """" ticket '' ( again see screenshots ) and informed me a few days later that they had rectified the problem and reopened my account but took all the funds and left me with a {$0.00} balance!

Barclays ( Gap ) has since sent me a new card but that still does not put me at ease due to the fact that this unverified credit card number is associated with my SSN when I used it at the GAP location. I did not have any issues with the card prior to this incident on XX/XX/23.","","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","GA","30127","","Consent provided","Web",2023-10-05,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7647407,2023

The two entities appear separate, and do not share information about account transactions and payments in real-time. I have noticed a pattern of consistent over-charge of interest as a result, which usually is most apparent when I pay my balance in full and receive a statement that I owe additional fees/interest after-the-fact. I believe this practice is deliberate, and contrived to passively retrieve more than agreed upon interest fees in the credit contract. I have to call every time this happens and request the interest fees be reversed. The fact that the company readily acknowledges the error of additional charges and reverses the fees without question leads me to believe that they are aware, and that many other consumers may just be unknowingly paying these fees without question. I have expressed to Barclay ( in these phone calls ) that this practice is patterned, unethical, and illegal and that someone should correct the error in the system. Today I am filing complaint in hopes that an outside investigation into their practices will bring them into compliance of federal fair-trade practices.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","AR","720XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-11-12,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7822764,2023

There has been more information gathered after their XXXX response on XX/XX/XXXX that involves two conversations with Barclays representatives. 

I am attaching tapes of these two conversations. 

1. The first is a recorded call on XX/XX/XXXX between a XXXX representative, XXXX, and a Barclays representative. Starting at XXXX - XXXX during this call, XXXX representative confirms that the bank ruled in my favor on the chargeback and they refunded the money on XX/XX/XXXX. 
2. The second conversation occurred on XX/XX/XXXX with a Barclay Supervisor named XXXX. Beginning at XXXX in this call, she states that there is a strong likelihood that XXXX refunded the money to the closed credit card XXXX and that was never transferred. 

Barclay continues to say that they returned the money to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX, in a XXXX complaint and on XX/XX/XXXX, says that they sent the money back on XX/XX/XXXX to the originating Barclay account ( XXXX ) which Barclay has previously closed so I had no access to transactions that occurred on that account. 

Further, in response to my XXXX XXXXCFPB complaint, I was given yet another unmanned phone line to contact regarding my complaint. When I call the number provided, I can only leave a message and to-date no one has responded to my inquiry in almost a month.

I disputed the charge with Barclay and sent them information and my dispute has been denied 3 times. The rationale is that the merchant has matching information to my identify. I have let them know that it will match because my information was stolen, and they would not have been able to purchase on my card if they did not have matching information. 

I have a receipt that includes the email where the XXXX tickets went to ( not mine ) and filed a police report. I don't think Barclay is being fair and currently that charge is still on my account. This may be potential UDAAP and Reg Z issues.

I then asked if there was another method of delivery as I had already spent more money than expected buying a large envelope and stamps. I was provided a fax number as the only other option. Once I had access to a fax number I resent the information, probably 4 weeks after initial application. I had not heard a response and 2 weeks later I called in again and was told I needed to speak to someone in fraud department to clear the application. At no point did Barclay 's try to reach out to me to clear anything. I spent time on the phone where an associate called me on a separate line to ask me some security questions and clear my application. I was told that the application would be approved once another department finished clearing. I then waited another 2-3 weeks and called in again after not hearing anything about my application. I had to go through the fraud department calling me on a separate line again and me answering security questions. I was told my application was being approved and I would receive a card in the mail within 14 days. More than 2 weeks past and I had not received a card. I called in one final time and asked for a Manager. I was told they could not approve my application because it had been more than 90 days and my credit report had expired. This manager then offered me to apply again and told me they now have all of my documents on file. I then confirmed that would require pulling a new credit bureau report which could negatively impact my credit score for an error on their end. She did not offer any other alternatives other than going through the application process again.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","OK","74105","","Consent provided","Web",2023-08-19,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7423440,2023

I called the Barclays Bank to dispute the charge and advise them that as per my disclosure agreement with them, I am protected from any and all unauthorized or fraudulent charges and that the charge billed by the restaurant is fraudulent and was never authorized or signed by me. They refused to accommodate me and protect me as a consumer and advised me that there's nothing they can do to reverse the charge.

XXXX did not offer a resolve to the intentional reporting of incorrect information and advised me to do another complaint with the information I now have to be attached to my previous complaint. 

My account STATEMENT always reflected a positive amount as a credit and not a debit. I now understand that the STATEMENT that is mailed or electronically delivered every month which gives an ACCOUNT SUMMARY as indicated on the bond portion of the payment coupon, is actually a dividend payment ( book entry security ) from securitizing my account through BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE, to BARCLAYS XXXX XXXX XXXX, to BARCLAYS XXXX XXXX TRUST, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as indenture trustee and BARCLAYS XXXX XXXX, the underwriter. It was not a BILL for me. 

The monthly BILL, STATEMENT that was mailed via PRESORTED first-class mail or emailed and presented to me as if I owed money, was actually a security and obligation of the issuer, BARCLAYS XXXX  XXXX TRUST from BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE , the servicer and repurchasing party, BARCLAYS XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and another repurchasing party and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX trustee and securities intermediary. 

I was never late as the true obligation was BARCLAYS XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX per the indenture agreement. I was actually defrauded out of securities and payments that were owed to me. The BOND portion of the STATEMENT which is actually a BOOK ENTRY security, should've been credited to me and the top portion processed properly through the bank, settling my account every month, for the full available credit ( allocated amount ) to be used again following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 

I am aware that there are two sides to the ledger. I am aware that there is a public side and a private side for every account that I have had with BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE. I am also aware that although my account was closed on the public side, my account was and is still open on the private side being securitized.

I was smugly advised via phone by XXXX XXXX ID # XXXX that despite settling the account, they will not send me my settlement letter for over a month. He explicitly said there would be no exceptions to this. OVER A MONTH. 

Initially, they kept transferring the debt from one creditor to another making it impossible for me to actually settle the account. Example : It got sent to one creditor, and when I called that creditor to pay it they told me I would need to wait 1 to 2 weeks for the account to be assigned to an agent. After waiting that long and calling back, they told me they had sent it back to Barclays. it then took over a week for Barclays to get the account in their system to they could discuss it with me. This was the 3rd time this happened. They played pinball with my debt sending it from creditor to another all over the country. This prevented me from paying on this collection for 3 months adversely impacting my credit and ability to find gainful employment. Now the delay of my settlement letter is another month of delays. I need my letter to start at a new job so I can get health insurance for my children who have desperate medical needs that I can not pay out of pocket and therefore need insurance. Barclays has drawn out this process at every opportunity despite my consistent and constant good faith efforts to settle this going back to XXXX of this year.

Upon that conversation, they opened an """" investigation case '' and told me that it could take up to two billing cycles for the investigation to be completed and I would not be responsible for interest or other fees during the investigation process.

Barclays gave me a case number for the investigation at this time. On XX/XX/XXXX, I reached back out to Barclays ( after receiving a threatening letter in the mail that my account was not in good standing and I needed to contact them immediately ). I reached out to XXXX XXXX Loans at this time and had them fax an official declaration of payment, showing that Barclays had cashed the check and applied it to an account. It had not been returned to XXXX XXXX Loans. On XX/XX/XXXX, I got a call from a collections bureau, once again telling me that my account is not in good standing and I need to make a payment immediately. I have asked where the payment is at this time and they have no answer. You can not speak directly to the investigations team. There is no avenue for that. I once again started chatting with the online chat help and they stated that they could not really do anything without me calling into the customer service department. Barclays has only reached out to me twice, once through a written and mailed letter and now once through a debt collections bureau. I still don't have an answer to where this money is now or when it will be located.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","OH","43015","","Consent provided","Web",2023-05-12,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6967452,2023

There were unique circumstances that led to the failure to pay the balance for two months, which has had a significant impact on my and my husband 's credit scores, and consequently, our family 's financial situation. 

Lack of Bank Statements : I did not receive bank statements for my Barclays Bank credit card account, which made it difficult for me to monitor my account 's status. The absence of this crucial information left me unaware of the pending balance. 

Physical Credit Card Absence : I did not, and do not, have the physical credit card, which further hindered my ability to track and manage my account. Without the card, I was unable to readily access information or make payments. 

Payment at XXXX XXXX : There was an instance when I made a payment at a XXXX XXXX by showing my driver 's license as identification. Unfortunately, I was not informed or provided with proper documentation to follow up with the charge, which eventually resulted in an unpaid balance. 

Good Track Record : Prior to this incident, my credit history with Barclays Bank had been consistently good. The balance of {$200.00} was relatively minor, and it was an isolated and unintentional oversight. 

XXXX 's Unjustly Affected XXXX XXXX : My husband is not the primary account holder, and he was entirely unfamiliar with the account in question. However, the adverse credit reporting has significantly and unfairly impacted his XXXX XXXX. This negative effect has caused serious consequences, particularly in relation to our mortgage and our ability to purchase the house we intended. 

I understand the importance of maintaining good financial standing and honoring my financial commitments. I also recognize that the adverse reporting was a result of unintended and unique circumstances that I was not in a position to adequately monitor or address.

Apparently, this customer representative also added in a clause that I would pay approximately {$150.00} per month- this was done without my consent but I did consent to the program he offered. This representative also waived the late fees ( I think ) because we've consistently been charged as late payment and have received late fee charges. 

For the next 3 months, I received monthly statements that said I was late in my payments when in fact I had paid {$300.00} in one month. There were several other unexplainable discrepancies so I called customer service.

I again explained to her that I made sure to call and ask before making the payment because making a second monthly payment in the same month was not possible. She explained again that it was on me to just deal with it. I asked to speak with a supervisor. The rep put me on hold for 12 minutes only to come back and say that there were no supervisors available that he was on a lunch break. Again she stated that I had to make another payment before XX/XX/XXXX. After this back and forth she placed me on hold for an additional 32 minutes only to tell me to call back later.

There is nothing in my contract stating how early I can or can not make a payment towards my loan due date. It only states that it can not be late. I also have the phone call with the first customer service rep telling me that a payment on XX/XX/XXXX would be credited towards my XX/XX/XXXX payment.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","SC","29073","","Consent provided","Web",2023-05-05,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6938521,2023

I immediately noticed that I would only receive XXXX points and not the XXXX bonus points rewards, Interest rates 21.24 %, 25.24 % based on credit worthiness. that caught my attention, also being the main objective for applying for the JetBlue Plus Card. Additionally, the rates differed.

The promotion described is the sole reason for why I would interrupt my credit score. Frantically, I reached out to customer services and was told that my account was to new to see any information regarding bonus point etc. I was told to call the credit department the following day, in which I did subsequently. 

On XX/XX/2023 I call in to customer service and spoke with a XXXX who who offer me an additional XXXX bonus point. I explained the situation a second time before requesting to have the matter escalated. 

A few hours later, I received a call from a XXXX XXXX Who was condescending passive aggressive and offensive. His lack of transparency and empathy created an unpleasant experience. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, around XXXX pm I received a call from the XXXX XXXX by way of security from a woman by the name of XXXX. I conveyed my concerns both verbally and written form via email. Also providing screenshots of the promotion and transaction and correspondence received. I was advised that she would look into the matter further, listen to calls with the representatives and get back to me. On Monday, XX/XX/2023, I received a call from XXXX indicating she had concluded her investigation and she was unable to extend the promotion because the investigation determined that I received the promotion for which I received. She also apologized for the customer service I received, after having listening to the call. She stated she could offer me XXXX points, but refused to extend the offer or cancel the card and has left me reluctant to have inquired about this partnership. 
The interaction with the managers along with the deceptive business practice has left me reluctant to maintain this partnership. 
I am respectfully requesting the following amicable resolution.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","MA","02169","","Consent provided","Web",2023-08-18,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7416553,2023

However, despite these assurances, the delinquent marks still appear on my credit reports. Further attempts to engage with Barclay 's customer service have resulted in misleading information, leaving me without a clear resolution and causing significant distress due to the impact on my creditworthiness.

The inaction and misguidance from Barclay Card Services have not only affected my credit score but are also impeding my ability to make important financial decisions. It is particularly concerning that this situation has arisen through no fault of my own, but as a result of errors and poor customer service from the financial institution. Furthermore, their customer support does not take proactive actions to correct this issue from their end. 

I am contacting the CFPB for assistance in having the incorrect delinquent marks removed from my credit reports. In addition, I would like to address the issue of misleading customer service and the failure by Barclay Card Services to rectify these errors.

The credit company again tried a XXXX attempt to clear the payment and it was denied. 

I then waited for the next billing cycle and the website told me my XXXX amount due was {$29.00} and I made that payment on time. It is important to note that up until now, I had never been late, missed any payments, nor was I in collections for attempt to collect a debt. 

A few weeks later in XXXX, I logged into the XXXX XXXX Barclays website and I was greeted with a Minimum amount due of over XXXX} dollars. I then spent from XX/XX/2023 until XX/XX/2023 ( XXXX Months ) trying to call them and ask why my Minimum monthly amount due was so high. 

For XXXX months I was given various different answers from all the account specialists that answered my calls. Some said it was an error due to the payment not clearing between XXXX billing cycles, others said they were collecting on the payment that didn't clear, then others said """" Oh there isn't a problem your monthly amount due is around {XXXX '' and I had to tell them that my statements and the website told me my """" Minimum monthly amount due '' was sky-high and now over {XXXX} due to late fees. I was told there is no problem just pay the """" Monthly amount due, it's different ''. 

However, every time I called I was greeted that they were attempting to collect a debt. I even sent a XXXX certified mail letter to dispute my problem and my case was closed saying there was no error on my account. I called back furious and asked for a XXXX. I was given a XXXX and promised my problem would be resolved and that a different XXXX would call me back in a few days to resolve it. They never called me. I called back and my case had been reviewed and closed again claiming """" no error on the account '' I was transferred to collections, and they told me """" It's an error for sure, but it looks like the system can't catch up because there has been no activity since then.

By now, I found out I was being marked late each month on my credit reports. Even though I was disputing this very issue for XXXX months, Barclays marked me late XXXX XXXX, and then around XX/XX/2023 they Closed my account! 

I called back and was told my account was closed because I didn't make my Minimum monthly amount due for {XXXX} and the lady that read it to me was almost in shock as she read it. Then I asked for a XXXX and the XXXX told me after careful review in their """" Back XXXX '' they do not plan to resolve my problem by putting my minimum monthly amount due back to normal and clearing my delinquent credit report and letting me resume payments. 

Problem : XXXX ) Barclays is blatantly violating the cards Terms and Conditions on how they shall calculate a XXXX XXXX.

I gave XXXX credit card information to charge my card for {$7000.00} the {$7000.00} charge appeared on my app letting me know that the transaction was completed. XXXX informed me that the funds were not available to him on his side. I had a carrier there to pick up the engine but they would not release the engine because the funds were not available to him at that time. We agreed to cancel the original transaction by having him, reject it to make the funds immediately available back to me. I then called Barclays my credit card company on a three-way call with XXXX to make sure that when he rejected the original payment of XXXX that it came back to my credit card. Once XXXX assured me that the money was returned on XX/XX/XXXX, i then approved a {$3500.00} charge to XXXX and then I sent him {$3500.00} through cash app to complete the transaction of a purchase of a {$7000.00} engine. The XXXX {$3500.00} transactions appeared on XXXX systems and he then released the engine. A few days later, I noticed a an additional charge of {$7000.00} from XXXX XXXX locating services which is XXXX business. I called my credit card company to dispute the additional {$7000.00} charge that process went on for a few weeks, there was some confusion about what I was disputing. They refunded me {$3500.00}. I wasnt sure why I told them again that I was disputing the additional {$7000.00} charge because I sent XXXX XXXX locating services XXXX payments of XXXX which completed the purchase of a {$7000.00} engine. Barclays then took the XXXX credit back. I sent them proof of the XXXX transactions of {$3500.00}, XXXX on the credit card and the other on cash app. I was then informed that the time to dispute the transaction was outside of their terms of disputing transactions. I called back and stated that I disputed this transaction a few days after I noticed the additional charge. Barclay said that that dispute was closed because I already received a credit of {$7000.00} but that credit was because he rejected the original purchase not because of a result of a dispute. And because of all the back-and-forth now theyre telling me that its too late to dispute the same {$7000.00} additional charge that I was asking them to look into from the very beginning but now its too late to dispute. The original credit of the XXXX that I received was because the merchant and I agreed to reject that transaction because the funds were not showing to be available at that time not sure why maybe because of the time of the day had something to do with it because I think it was like XXXX. So we decided to break it up into two smaller transactions. There was no dispute there. We agreed on that with Barclay on a three-way call with the merchant because I wasnt going to authorize an additional {$3500.00} transaction until I felt comfortable with the original XXXX credit return to my cart.

Tuesday the credit was not returned. I visited XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and was told the credit would be returned to my credit card on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX.

2023-02-04,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Other features, terms, or problems","Other problem","The below letter to Barclays explains my situation. In addition to being scammed, I am now being asked by Barclays to reimburse them for funds that should never have been accepted by them if they conducted proper due diligence. It is scary to know that one only has to present any bank account number and routing number to a credit card company and they will proceed to take funds from that account without proper safety checks. Even more scary is the fact that one 's banking info is essentially public, as it appears on every check. 

XX/XX/2022 Barclays XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, DE XXXX Dear Sirs, Re : JETBLUE REWARDS XXXX XXXX # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I refer to your letter dated XX/XX/2022, on the above subject, advising me that A recent payment on XXXX JetBlue XXXX XXXX account has been returned by your bank for Identity of Authorized User. As a result, we have removed this external bank account information from our system and the payment has been reversed. 
Needless to say, your decision is quite puzzling and seems to be high-handed under the circumstances. Consequently, allow me to add some context to this unsettling matter. 
On XXXX, 2022, I started working with XXXXl XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX NY XXXX, as a XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
In order to purchase products, XXXX provided their banking info ( Checking Account ; Account # XXXX ; Routing # XXXX ; Account Nickname : XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ) with XXXX XXXX XXXX and instructed that I use this bank account to put funds into my JetBlue credit card. The following payments were made to the card : XXXX XXXX, 2022 : {$20000.00} XXXX XXXX, 2022 : XXXX TOTAL : {$40000.00} Barclays immediately confirmed that the funds were received and credited the card accordingly. No mention was made by Barclays at the time that the source of the funds was questionable. 
Using these funds, purchases were then made from XXXX XXXX and XXXX, and the goods were subsequently shipped out to XXXX XXXX as per XXXX instructions. XXXX unexpectedly ceased operations around XXXX XXXX, 2022. 
XXXX my surprise when, by your letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2022, almost XXXX ( XXXX ) months after the first transaction on XXXX XXXX, 2022, you are now advising that the payments of {$40000.00} made into the card account in early XXXX were now being reversed because my name was not listed as an authorized user on the XXXX XXXX account this was the reason given to me by your Customer Service when I called after receiving your letter. 
Why did you not alert me immediately of this fact on XXXX, 2022? If you did, then this situation would not have arisen. 
Your decision to hold me liable for repayment of the {$40000.00} is ludicrous, as Barclays failed in its responsibility to protect the cardholder by not performing due diligence on the source of funds in a timely manner. Barclays actions, or lack thereof, constitute a breach of fiduciary duty. 
Every check written has the accountholders bank account number and routing number printed on the check. Hence it is safe to say that this information is in the public domain. Knowing this fact, why would Barclays simply accept anyones account number and routing number alone as a payment source, without conducting proper due diligence to verify that the accountholder and cardholder are XXXX and the same, and is in fact making the payment? This due diligence should be immediate. Yet it took Barclays XXXX ( 2  ) MONTHS to determine that the cardholders name ( my name ) was not on the XXXX XXXX XXXX account being used! 
Please be aware that I have reported XXXX as purporting a scam, to the following agencies : Florida Attorney General Federal Trade Commission XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Notwithstanding XXXX purported scam, I hold Barclays to be complicit in this matter as they failed to adequately protect the cardholder from this scam. 
I trust that common sense will prevail in this matter, and you will see it prudent to remove the {$40000.00} from my account. 
PLEASE BE GUIDED ACCORDINGLY. 
Cc : XXXX XXXX Barclay 's latest response below : Response Customer care via XXXX XXXX pm Hi XXXX XXXX XXXX Thank you for contacting us about your JetBlue Rewards Card XXXX 

We understand your concern and apologize if your received anything less than exceptional service. We see that the payment on the account for XX/XX/2022 and XX/XX/2022 has been returned. We can not determine the nature of a payment information until it has cleared or not cleared an an account and that can take anywhere from XXXX days on larger payments. The XXXX XXXX where the deposit for Barclays payments was made are the ones who rejected and the payment due to the fact you are not a authorized user on the account. We do apologize for the inconvenience and hope we have clarified the situation. 

Barclays is required to report account history accurately. We update your credit report monthly, and it XXXX take 30 days for the credit bureaus to update their records. Accounts are not reported to the credit bureaus as past due until they are 60 days past the statement cycle date and greater than 30 days past the statement due date. At that time, accounts are reported as a XXXX delinquency.

We had private transportation arranged by the resort from the airport. 
We were taken to a large room that was being used as the check-in area. My credit card was taken from me to be added to our reservation for incidental charges. The card was out of my possession for an extended period of time while we waited to be checked in. 
When we returned from our vacation on XX/XX/2023, I immediately checked my credit card account online. I discovered an unauthorized charge of {$1800.00} from a merchant named XXXX made on the day of our check-in, XX/XX/2023. Upon researching this merchant, it is listed as a taxi service. We did not use this service as we had our own private transportation from the airport through the resort. Logistically, the charge doesn't even make sense as we were not in the country long enough to have a taxi charge of this amount from the airport. XXXX XXXX is only about XXXX minutes. Once we arrived at the resort and checked in, we never left the resort until we checked out on XX/XX/2023. 
I have made numerous phone calls over the past 6 months to XXXX. I have submitted documentation showing proof of our private transportation, proof of our arrival time into the XXXX XXXX, email addresses for our travel agent and staff at the resort to confirm all the information submitted. 
The credit card company stated that since this is a chip card, I approved the transaction. I did not approve it and the charge was made while the card was out of my possession at the resort. I have requested proof, that the transaction was approved, from the credit card company and it has not been provided. The credit card company said they were unable to contact the merchant and that I should do this. I tried several times using the information found online but there is never an answer to the phone number and no other contact information. This is a fraudulent charge from a fraudulent company. I was told, in writing, that I should not pay the disputed amount and that I would not be charged interest on the disputed amount but I have been charge interest for several months now. I have requested a supervisor/manager to call me to discuss the decision by the credit card company, to refuse to reverse the charge and interest. 
I have been promised 3 times that someone would call me in XXXX hours, then XXXX hours, then XXXX hours again. No one ever calls. I have had this case reopened 4 times now.

It really should not be this hard for them to see that the charges are fraudulent. I live in XXXX the charges were in California and Tenessessee.

Quite simply, I closed this account several months ago after Barclays refused to stop letting XXXX charge me even after I had frozen and blocked the merchant after canceling my service XX/XX/2023. I closed this account prior to leaving the US for the summer. I called to confirm. I was assured I would receive my prorated annual fee back, as I had just paid it. I have yet to receive it. I have received nothing for these services, nor have I received a check in the mail. I reached back out to Barclays after returning to Texas after months abroad and of course received no reply. Barclays seems only to respond to federal level consumer complaints, which I find disturbing. It was a {$99.00} annual fee. I had paid it just shortly before the debacle with them allowing a merchant I had blocked to repeatedly charge my card. I am currently in the process of writing a consumer story on this whole nightmare, but I surely never thought they would hold my own money hostage. I am owed well over half of my annual fee, of it, which, frankly, I would like with the 29 % interest they charge when their consumers are late. I was never late, which is why I am baffled as to why they were so terrible to deal with. It certainly makes me wonder how they treat their worst customers.

That XXXX is XXXX mins down XXXX XXXX from me. I paid using a Barclays credit card.-It was the only online order I placed. 

XXXX XX/XX/23 I received multiple emails from XXXX XXXX, advising the items I just ordered were ready for pick up in a XXXX XXXX FLORIDA XXXX I immediately called the XXXX number for XXXX to report the fraud. They locked my XXXX account. I told them the items had not yet been picked up ( That's what the emails were telling me, I rescued quite a few that day ) The XXXX associate advised not to worry, they would handle it. 

-As soon as I got off the phone I called my Barclays card. I reported the fraudulent transaction. They canceled my card. 

XXXX ( A little over a month later ) I received a letter from Barclays saying they had investigated the incident and they it was not fraud as XXXX provided evidence that the items were picked up. ( Not something I'm disputing, I just said it wasn't me and I never placed the order ) I rang Barclays and filed another complaint. They re-opened the investigation. 

XXXX I spent XXXX on the phone trying to contact anyone that would help me at XXXX. Three hours later I was able to speak to a lady who identified herself as XXXX. She listened to my entire complaint and advised she could see that I had called in and filed the report on the XXXX of XXXX, but could not see that anything was done about the complaint, or that it was even forwarded to the fraud department. She told me it would be forwarded to the fraud department and that someone would contact me. I asked her to email me some proof that I had spoken to her, since I had no proof of the original complaint. She sent me an email on the same day advising she received the complaint. I have the email. 

XXXX I received another letter from Barclays advising that the purchase was not fraud, as XXXX provided them with a document that the items were picked up and the purchase went through.

AND I called Barclays and immediately cancelled my card. Barclays representative said that unless I have proof that it was not me that made the order, they can not do anything. I am stumped. How can I provide that proof? It's as if they want me to find the perpetrator and drag them to their office and force them to confess to fraud.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","OR","970XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-09-19,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7573044,2023

2023-10-19,"Credit card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem when making payments","Problem during payment process","Back in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX of XXXX, I received a call from Barclay 's Bank asking me to make a payment on the account. I asked them what they meant by that? They said I hadn't made a payment, and I was two months past due. When I asked them why I was late since this card was on autopay for nearly two years and on top of that I would manually go in there on occasion and make an additional payment, they didn't know how to answer me. 

The representatives tried to turn it around on me and asked me if I had changed bank accounts. I told them I've had the same bank account for years, so that wasn't the issue. They asked if maybe I didn't have enough funds to cover the payment, but again, I told them that wasn't the issue. More so since the minimum payment on this card has always been low. Somewhere around {$30.00} to {$75.00} max. Again, they tried to make excuses, but they couldn't really answer me. While on the phone with them, I tried to get into my online account, but it wasn't letting me login. I tried numerous times, but I was unsuccessful in logging in. I asked them how I could log in because their online system was giving me problems. The representative said she would help me, then said she would come back as soon as she found out how, but she hung up on me after a long hold period. 

I didn't give up because I am a responsible person, so I called back immediately, and I explained to the next representative that I had just been on the line with someone trying to get assistance in logging in so I can make a payment. The same thing happened with the second representative. This second time was a bit more blatant, however. She didn't put me on hold, she just said she would help me but ended up hanging up on me as well. The third phone call finally had some success. The third representative listened to me and told me this was the easiest thing to help me with, so she isn't sure why I wasn't being helped or why they hung up on me. She manually reset the password from her end, and I was finally able to log in and make a payment. None of that explained why my autopay ceased to function, or why their online website just decided to stop working for me. After that happened, I went about my way as I thought the matter had been resolved, but lo and behold, nearly a year later I am getting turned down for a mortgage loan because I had a 30 and a 60 day late payment reporting on my credit report for the same time which coincided with this situation. 

After I was told by the lender that this is preventing me from buying a home, I called Barclays to find out why they are reporting me late. This was around XXXX of XXXX. Please keep in mind that I am now only speaking with foreigners and their English was rough. They told me what I already knew. They said in their broken English, """" Oh the system must have been down. '' They also gave me numerous excuses, but in the end, none of them could help me. I then sent letters to Barclays as well as to the three credit bureaus on XX/XX/XXXX, informing them how their system was down and how I was mistreated by several Barclay 's employees while trying to address this issue. The only thing I got back from this is a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX saying the late payments are accurate, but they will place a dispute notice to the credit bureaus. 

I don't believe this is right, nor is it fair. Understandably, the credit bureaus are supposed to reflect accurate information so lenders can determine who is responsible and who is not. But just because something was """" accurately '' 30 or 60 days late, that doesn't mean that it was 30 or 60 days late due to me not attempting to pay them on time. It doesn't show how an account being 30 or 60 days late could actually be a fault of the creditor itself. If a creditor 's auto billing is faulty, or their system is broken, how can the consumer be blamed for it? How about the fact that I wasn't actually notified about this until I was already 2 months late. Not by text, e-mail, mail, calls, nothing. I shouldn't be blamed for their auto billing system malfunctioning one day after it had been working fine for nearly two years by that point. And I definitely should not have to suffer credit damage for the next 7 years because of it. AND I absolutely should NOT be suffering credit denials due to this. 

Can you please talk to Barclays and have them fix this problem they helped cause? I'm losing out on opportunity after opportunity on homes because of this problem they helped cause.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","CA","93309","","Consent provided","Web",2023-10-19,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7728286,2023

I want to emphasize the importance of accurate reporting and the impact it has on my overall financial well-being.

However, there has been no visible progress in your investigation, and the inaccurate information persists on my credit report. 
I am reaching out to seek clarification on the status of my dispute and to understand the steps being taken to address the inaccuracies in my credit report.

That has been the only charge on that card since then. 

I made regular payments and saw interest charges of ~ {$30.00} each month. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email warning that the scheduled payment was lower than the minimum, even though I had changed nothing. Looking into it, I realized my interest charge had jumped from ~ {$30.00} to ~ {$190.00}. 

I called Barclays and they explained that my promotional period was over. When I explained that I had been explicitly told by a Barclay representative before making the large purchase that the promotion would apply to purchases made within the period instead of to balances within the period, the {$190.00} interest charge was comp 'd and I was told an investigation would be opened to review the account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called again to ask about the status of that investigation. The first representative repeatedly gave me incorrect and conflicting information, telling me that the investigation was ongoing, concluded, and never occurred at different points in the conversation.

Barclays is a disgrace and I will NEVER do business with them again in any regard and I will urge everyone I know to stay away from them too. This is not how you treat people and I am at the end of my rope trying to get this situation resolved. It's affecting my credit when I have done everything right to protect it over the last 30 years. NOT OK! 

I have contacted Barclays no less than 3 times with urgency to get the full year of statements prior to closing the account to prove that I always had autopay turned on, but no one is getting back to me. If I don't hear back from someone to get this resolved and the mark removed from my credit reports, I will sue. None of this is ok. It's fraud and negligence and it is affecting my livelihood. I will not stand for it.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","CA","90046","","Consent provided","Web",2023-02-10,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6555902,2023

I accepted the offer for this card in XX/XX/XXXX. It had an introductory interest rate of 0 % for 12 billing cycles. This was for both purchases AND balance transfers. 

On the first two statements I saw that they charged me interest on the balance transfer that I made from another card. Today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I called to dispute this and was told that the interest rate was 24.49 % for balance transfers ( and 0 % for purchases ). I explained that the offer had been for 0 % interest rate on balance transfers. I explained that I had the 'Accounts Summary Table ' in front of me, which came with the card that confirms 0 % interest on balance transfers ( for 12 months ). A copy of this is being uploaded with this complaint. The associate I talked ( very politely ) to seemed not to believe me when I said I had that confirmation. She said that she could do nothing about this because I had accepted a card with 24.49 % interest on balance transfers. I reiterated that I had not accepted that and that I had confirmation of the 0 % offer. 

The amounts of interest that they have charged so far are {$68.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, and {$65.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I expect that I will get a interest charge on XX/XX/XXXX too if this is not sorted out.

The payments are submitted/received every 4 weeks. I set this up after my credit line being switched over to Barclays and my due date being switched. I was not informed of the switch prior to it happening. This caused me to have two minimum payments due in one month. I called and spoke with a representative at that time who explained the switch up of due dates was because of the credit line being switched to a new lender. After adjusting my monthly payment due date to the XXXX of each month to line up with my autopay I left it alone. I confirmed that everything would be fine going forward. I have not had any issues with my autopay or payments being applied correctly until XX/XX/2023. Due to the fact that Barclays received my payment on XX/XX/2023, they are reporting that it was applied during my last billing cycle ( XX/XX/2023. They received my XXXX payment on XX/XX/2023 ), so there is another payment due on XX/XX/2023. I called and asked for explanation. They explained it was due to my billing cycle close date. I asked if the funds could be applied towards my XXXX balance due, for which it was intended. It was explained to me that there is nothing that they can do on their end because that is just how the system works. I asked who created /monitors the system because while it may run itself, there has to be some type of human interaction for when things go awry. They explained there is nothing more they can do for me, so I informed them that I needed to close the account and that I would be reporting their business tactics.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","MD","20603","","Consent provided","Web",2023-02-14,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6563954,2023

I would note that more than one Barclays representative asserted that the purchases made were indeed delivered to my home, whereas it has been confirmed with XXXX XXXX that the purchases were not delivered to my home but were instead sent to multiple unrelated addresses.

I have never received an online invoice from Barclays for my account ending in XXXX, which has resulted in numerous and costly late fees. 

Recently I received a letter from Barclays indicating both my credit line and my credit score had been reduced due to late payments. 

When I called Barclays to investigate this problem, I was told that I had a XXXX ( {$0.00} ) balance at the end of XXXX XXXX but that there was a subsequent {$10.00} purchase on XX/XX/. The charge appears to be from XXXX XXXX with no indication of what it was for. I do not recognize this charge nor has Barclays been able to identify what it was for. 

Because I never received an invoice from you, I was not aware of this charge for a purchase I never made and believed there was no outstanding balance on the account. Unbeknownst to me, my account began accumulating substantial late fees that now total {$72.00}. Without this charge the account wouldnt incurred no late charges, interest or fees. I have placed this charge in dispute ( see below ). 

Last week, my husband XXXX XXXX made several attempts to rectify this situation by phone. With my authorization, he first spoke with an agent who understood the issue but lacked authorization to correct the problem. This agent scheduled a call back from a manager who would have the proper permission. The manager left a message. 

When my husband returned the call, he spoke agent ID # XXXX and was told that he was no longer authorized ( despite this being the same day as he was authorized ) to discuss the issue so she wouldnt speak to him. 

On my husbands third attempt, he spoke agent ID # LASMCK who said she was authorized to speak to him but refused to do anything about the situation. Consequently, my husband formally put the {$10.00} charge in dispute. Despite that, the letter I received indicates that this charge still hasnt been put into dispute. 

I expect Barclays to remedy this situation by : 1. Removing the disputed {$10.00} charge from my account. 
2. Canceling any and all late fees and interest. Without this charge the account had and would still have a {$0.00} balance. Late fees and interest are inappropriate. 
3. Refunding the annual fee of {$99.00} given the excessive amount of time I have spent dealing with this problem. 
4. Notifying XXXX XXXX and any other credit bureaus of the error so my credit score is restored. 
5. Sending me a formal letter saying that the account is not in arrears and never has been. 
6. Canceling my account immediately.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","MA","017XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-03-30,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",6772612,2023

I'm able to pay more than my monthly statement minimum, however paying down the total balance is becoming increasingly difficult because I'm unable to work as much due to lower energy from long covid last year.

I was also told that I could allow my account to lapse into Collections and not receive interest. Going to Collections would lower my Credit Score.

I called immediately and was told that the amount due was interest and late charges because of that interest that was not paid. 
I paid the amount that was requested of me promptly and inquired as to how there could be a balance given that I had paid my balance in full about 3-4 months ago and had not since used the card.

The person on the phone told me that although I had paid my balance in full, interest charges had posted at a later date because I had paid in full prior to the due date.

I told the agent that I was never informed of a new balance and was told that it may be due to Gap being newly sponsored by Barclay 's Bank and I may not have recognized a billing from them. 

I explained that this did not seem fair and that my credit profile and scores would now be unfairly affected. 
I was directed to speak to a supervisor. 

I called on two occasions to discuss this with two supervisors. 
Both said they could not do anything for me and both told me to contact the FCRA. 

I understand that the FCRA is the Fair Credit Reporting Act and is not an agency. 

I don't feel it is fair to affect a persons credibility ( credit profile ) when there is no intention of non-payment as well as poor communication from the creditor.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","CA","91748","","Consent provided","Web",2023-01-17,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6447755,2023

For some reason other than non-payment the account was closed and I was never informed. Barclays has a policy that once the account is closed you do not continue to have online access. I had always made automatic payments and was able to review my account statements on line. There was a period in which I was never notified and did not and still do not receive paper statements. 

On XX/XX/23 spoke to row different operators OP XXXX XXXX on a recorded call XXXX XXXXXXXX then transferred to the manager who would not identify herself with operator number name XXXX on recorded call XXXX XXXXXXXX. 

Through this discussion they acknowledged that I had no access to my online account they had stopped sending statements. Because the stamens stated the options to pay was through their online account, send a check and or use their IDR system. 

Apparently I do to use to receive emails saying to go paperless and sign up for the online access but company policy does not allow closed accounts to have online access. Every month I have to call to make a payment and I have had several issues even accomplishing this. I have to go through 3-4 transfer to different operators and then end up having to speak to an account manager specialist. Its exhausting having to repeat and repeat same identifying information to each operator. Besides being obnoxious and repeating myself with the same information to each. 

I can not set up a recurring payment, I can not have an online access to make payments. Every time when and if I get a statement the options to pay are not valid. Statement says online payments, over the phone and via check. I have always paid thru online system and now they are requiring me to change after 7 years with this account. 

I have been reported to the credit bureaus for delinquent payments and their system is set up so that they came excuse themselves saying their is a system update when payments are due to force a late payment fee. 

I just want my online access to review what they are charging me and make my payment online like I always have and not have to go through leaps and bounds to make a simple online payment.

For weeks, I had been trying to enroll in Barclays longterm hardship program, for which I am qualified for, via their website. With this program, my XXXX would be reduced to 5.9 % and my monthly payments would decrease to {$180.00}. Unfortunately, I received error messages every time I tried to finalize the enrollment. 

I finally called their customer support to get assistance with enrolling on XX/XX/2023. During this phone call, the account manager informed me that I would need to go ahead and pay the {$180.00} at the time of enrollment in order for me to be successfully accepted into the program. Due to the financial hardship I am experiencing, I was unable to pay the {$180.00} on the phone at that moment. The customer service agent informed me that I would be able to go through their website ( as I had been trying to do before ) to enroll once I had the money. She emphasized that I would just need to go ahead and pay the first payment of {$180.00} upfront. 

Later that night, I was able to scrap together the {$180.00} that I was told I needed. I went through the steps on their website to enroll and submitted a payment for {$180.00} specifically for the hardship program ( I did NOT authorize money to be taken from my bank account for a regular payment ). The next day, XX/XX/2023, I saw that the money had been taken out of my account, but there was no proof of enrollment in the hardship program. Upon calling the Barclays customer service line, I was informed that I had not been enrolled in the program and I would need to now pay {$170.00} to enroll. I asked if the {$180.00} I had already paid could be refunded and they refused. The pressed me to pay the additional {$170.00} to enroll via phone. I gave in and scheduled a payment for the {$170.00} payment over the phone. When I asked for proof of enrollment, they were unwilling to give me anything that confirmed I had been enrolled. Instead, they advised that I would receive a letter at an unspecified time. 

Because I was unable to get any confirmation, nor had I gotten a refund for the {$180.00} I had already paid, I canceled all scheduled payments. I am now working with my bank to dispute the {$180.00} that I did not authorize for payment outside of the hardship program. 

I am unsure what to do next as I am now still not enrolled in the hardship program. The longer I am without the program, the closer my account gets to being considered delinquent. I am trying my best to avoid this but Barclays is refusing to work with me, despite me being qualified for the program. 

I am needing assistance getting enrolled in their hardship program and being refunded the {$180.00} I paid under false pretenses.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","TN","38127","","Consent provided","Web",2023-08-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7352413,2023

Soon after, I received an email stating that my order was unpaid. I clicked the link on the email to complete my order. I then received an email stating that my order was paid. The following day, I noticed I was charged twice for the same exact order. I tried contacting the company via phone, but they would not return my calls. When I contacted the company via email, they said that two of the same orders were placed. I asked that one of the orders be canceled because I did not need two of the exact same orders. They stated that unfortunately they could not cancel the order at this time. They instructed me to go to my local post office to cancel the package. When I went to the post office, they stated that this [ canceling the package ] is some thing that they could not do, but that the merchant should cancel the package. I contacted the company again via their app to let them know and asked for a refund. I explained that when I received the package, I would return it. The merchant said that I had to pay {$30.00} to return the {$160.00} of items. I explained that this was not my fault, but on fault of the company. I tried again to schedule a """" hotline appointment, '' but they never called. They were adamant that I would have to pay {$30.00} to return the second package. 

I contacted Barclays to dispute the charge on XX/XX/XXXX.

During this time, I was not notified about any information that Barclays may need however, I did try to contact Barclays via phone throughout the process. At no point was I able to speak to someone directly about my open dispute. After the decision of siding with the merchant was made, I sent Barclays back several pieces of evidence that shows the merchant was unwilling to except the return and that they fraudulently charged me for two of the exact same orders. Barclays dispute center only receives information/evidence via mail, which makes it very difficult to immediately hear back from Barclays.

YOUR COMPLAINT Today I am taking action by filing this complaint regarding my XXXX XXXX that is financed through Barclay 's bank. The first thing I noticed is that Barclay 's took over the XXXX XXXX and didn't inform us. Barclay 's did not alert us. I have the majority of my credit card bills physically mailed to me, so when they took over they had to have switched to e-bill without my consent and I missed two payments because the bills were not physically mailed to us. I called customer service and they set me up on one of their programs for three months which was supposed to prevent me from getting fined for late payments. Apparently, this customer representative also added in a clause that I would pay approximately {$150.00} per month- this was done without my consent but I did consent to the program he offered. This representative also waived the late fees ( I think ) because we've consistently been charged as late payment and have received late fee charges. For the next 3 months, I received monthly statements that said I was late in my payments when in fact I had paid {$300.00} in one month. There were several other unexplainable discrepancies so I called customer service. While talking to customer service, I realized while looking at my bill that Barclay 's has been charge me double interest!!! Customer service said she would have a manager or supervisor call me regarding this problem. To this day I haven't spoken to any representative. I did receive a letter in the mail stating that they were aware that I had concerns about my account and that I should called customer service again to address my concerns.

2023-07-09,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Struggling to pay your bill","Credit card company won't work with you while you're going through financial hardship","Hello my name is XXXX XXXX. I am writing with great concern and disappointment regarding an issue I am currently experiencing with my credit card company. 
I have been a loyal customer of Barclays credit card for several years now, ensuring all my payments are made in a timely fashion, even in the face of difficult circumstances. Recently, however, I found myself in a situation that necessitated a request for some temporary assistance from their company due to financial hardship. 

As you may be aware, the economic situation has been challenging for many families, including mine. I recently lost my job and my household income has reduced significantly. Despite this setback, I have strived to continue making payments on my account to maintain my good credit standing.

I know CFBP has been a strong consumer advocate and often direct consumers to contact their credit card in a time of need. In view of this, On XX/XX/202 I completed an online request for a repayment plan, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email advising that I was denied. On XX/XX/2023 I reached out to their customer service, seeking help. My request was to see if my interest rate could be lowered or to facilitate a credit repayment plan that would allow me to continue making payments, albeit at a lower amount. 
To my surprise and disappointment, I was advised that in order to access any form of assistance, my account would first need to be delinquent or default. On XX/XX/2023, I wrote letter to XXXX XXXX the CEO explaining to him my concern. On XXXX XXXX someone from XXXX executive team called and left me voice message advising that they did received my email and would follow up with me shortly. On XX/XX/2023, XXXX from the XXXXxecutive team called to advise me they had no program available for me and that I would have be in default to take advantage of any repayment program. 

This is not only counterintuitive but also contradicts the general advice of CFPB advising consumers to contact credit companies at the first sign of financial distress. Also because my careers is in the financial industry, being in default my be detrimental on my career. 
This policy seems to penalize customers who are proactive in their financial management and are trying to avoid default. This condition leaves me in a precarious position as I try to do the right thing by maintaining my commitment to their company, while also caring for the wellbeing of my family. 

I am reaching out to CFPB in hopes of some form of assistance. 
I look forward to hearing from you and positive resolution that does not entail damaging my creditworthiness.

On XXXX XX/XX/2023, I saw the transfer had not posted to Barclays, so I called XXXX to inquire about the status of the transfer. After speaking with a customer service representative, I spoke with a supervisor who informed me that XXXX sent the payments out by paper check on XXXX XX/XX/2023 from Maryland to the Barclays payment address, which is a post office box in XXXX, Pa. They also told me the transfer would likely take XXXX business days. ( In comparison, I made another balance transfer that day for {$9900.00} from my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account to a different XXXX card ; it was handled electronically and the balances for each card adjusted accordingly overnight. ) On XXXX XX/XX/2023, I again noticed no balance transfer had posted on my Barclays account, so I called Barclays to inquire about the whereabouts of the balance transfer.

I opened my online savings account at Barclays Bank in XXXX, and in the eight years since, I never had any problems with this account until last week. Barclays allows customers to link up to three external accounts for fund transfers. I already had two linked external accounts, and decided to add a third account which is an established savings account I have had at XXXX XXXX XXXX  since XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I entered the required account and routing number to set up the third account on Barclays website, and shortly after received an email from Barclays stating that two small trial deposits would be sent to the XXXX  XXXX account within 2-3 business days ; I would then need to log back into my Barclays account to verify the trial deposit amounts to finish linking the account. It should be noted at this point that I was not attempting to transfer any funds, I only wanted to add this account for possible future transfers. On the evening of Monday, XX/XX/XXXX I received another email from Barclays stating that my account access had been suspended. No reason for the suspension was given, but the email requested that I call Barclays Customer Care """" so we can review recent activity on your account and restore your access. '' I called Customer Care on the morning of Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX and was told my account had been suspended because they needed me to email them a bank statement from the XXXX  XXXX account that I had recently tried to link. I was given an email address to send the statement to, which I immediately sent. I was told it would probably take """" around three business days '' for my online access to be restored after they received the copy of the bank statement. Interestingly, the two trial deposits were made to the XXXX XXXX account on XX/XX/XXXX, but since I had already been completely locked out of my Barclays account the day before, I had no way to verify them. More than one week has passed since my account was suspended, and I am still completely locked out of my Barclays account. I have sent Barclays copies of the XXXX XXXX bank statement twice in the past week, and so far they have not responded in any way. Any assistance you can provide to recover my savings and restore my account access will be greatly appreciated. Please feel free contact me if you have any questions or need additional information to resolve this nightmare.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","AR","72956","","Consent provided","Web",2023-05-10,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6952771,2023

The actual XXXX XXXX  website was sold out of this design shirt. The XXXX website states the products are 100 % authentic. The website also states that orders are processed and shipped with XXXX business days. After placing my order, the website stated I would receive an email confirmation of my order. My credit card was charged, though I never did receive an order confirmation. I then reached out to XXXX on XX/XX/2023 after not receiving any information regarding my order or a shipping confirmation. After not receiving any response, I reached out again on XX/XX/2023 for a status update on my order. After XXXX of no response and no product, on XX/XX/2023 I filed a payment dispute with Barclay Card for the purchase amount of {$85.00}. Surprisingly I then received a plain white plastic wrapped bag direct from XXXX with no labels, tags or paperwork included in the mail. The shirt that was delivered resembled the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that I had ordered, though was an obvious poor imitation. I immediately emailed the customer service email at XXXX in order to initiate a return, though I never received a response. 
XXXX was able to provide the shipping information and delivery confirmation to Barclay Card and my non-delivery dispute was denied. Barclay Card mailed the denial letter along with the information provided by XXXX to me. 
The response from XXXX showing that I had received authentic merchandise was flawed for several reasons : XXXX. The tracking information shows the item came from XXXX, though XXXX XXXX XXXX  is made in XXXX XXXX and shipped to the customer from the XXXX headquarters in XXXX, Virginia. XXXX is in no way involved. 
XXXX. XXXX included supposed email communication, though there is no communication from me in those messages? The XXXX email I have from XXXX following the dispute does not show my email address in any of the previous emails. I have all my emails stored in the cloud so even if they arrived in my spam box, I would be able to find them, which I could not. 
XXXX. XXXX included a picture of the shirt that was supposedly shipped, which shows images of the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXt that I ordered. This again shows the information provided was not authentic to my purchase. 
I attempted to email XXXX again to initiate a return of the shirt I had received and received no reply. I also called the customer service number on the XXXX XXXX, though the phone had been disconnected. 
I called Barclay Card and explained the situation of the imitation merchandise and was told, they could not open a new claim number, but I could submit a dispute under the same claim number, along with the reason for the new dispute. On XX/XX/2023 I mailed XXXX XXXX a description of the overall situation along with XXXX side-by-side comparison pictures of the shirt I received compared to an authentic XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I also included the actual listing page from the XXXX website, the Dinalala FAQ page stating they sell authentic merchandise and that purchases are shipped within XXXX business days. 
After submitting the XXXX dispute based on the imitation merchandise. XXXX XXXX mailed a response stating that they can not refund my payment because the merchant has not violated the terms and conditions of the contract. This is concerning for several reasons. 
XXXX. The first reason is that XXXX XXXX completely dismissed my submission without reading it. The Federal Trade Commission states that if a consumer is subject to online shopping fraud, their first line of defense is to reach out to their card issuer. Unfortunately, XXXX XXXX did not operate under these principles. 
XXXX. This would imply that the terms and conditions of the contract that Barclay Card is referring to does not address merchant fraud in any manner.

3. The terms and conditions of the contract that Barclay Card is referring to allows for fraud.

4. The final possibility is that the terms and conditions of the contract that Barclay Card is referring to promotes a Buyer Beware setting and allows for merchants to prey on unsuspecting consumers.

None of these options are positive. 
I did attempt to reach out to XXXX again and by this time, the website had also been removed. 
I called Barclay Card again after receiving this decision letter in the mail, because it appeared the information I sent was not actually reviewed. When I called on XX/XX/2023 at XXXXXXXX XXXX the agent ( I cant find her name ) looked at the merchandise comparison pictures with me, and even in XXXX and XXXX, agreed very much that the item in question was not the same as the authentic XXXX shirt. Although she is not able to make the decision, she sent a note to the back-house investigative team to reopen my case and she instructed me to send the information again to the Billing Disputes department. I mailed the complete packet of supportive information again on XX/XX/2023. The packet was lost in the mail, per USPS Tracking, and I had to mail a third copy to Barclay Card on XX/XX/2023 which was signed for on XX/XX/2023. 
The XXXX response from the Barclay Card Dispute Office once again says that after a detailed review even though the letter is dated the same XX/XX/2023 day it was signed for through my Certified Mail submission. There could not have been a detailed review, only a quick dismissal and another denial letter. 
The review would not need to be nearly as detailed as they would leave one to believe they performed. A quick scan of the comparison pictures I sent along with the picture of the XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX shows as the shirt delivered, which has nothing to do with my purchase and the tracking information from XXXX should allow for a reasonable conclusion that this was not the authentic product. 
I am submitting this complaint based on the fraudulent merchandise that was sold to me and the lack of cooperation from Barclay Card to review my complaint. With the size and impact of fraudulent XXXX activity it is concerning that Barclay Card is unwilling to get involved.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","FL","32832","","Consent provided","Web",2023-11-28,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7921909,2023

Despite multiple calls to customer service department and assurances from representatives, I have yet to receive the bonus miles that I was eligible for after hitting a {$3000.00} spending threshold within the first three months of card activity. 

I applied to the Miles and More credit card in XX/XX/2023 that is a card that comes with a costly annual fee and with great anticipation, mainly due to the enticing offer of bonus miles, which were a significant factor in my decision to choose the card over other alternatives. As a loyal customer, I have made every effort to comply with the terms and conditions of the promotion, carefully monitoring my spending activity to ensure I reached the required spending threshold within the specified timeframe. 

I reached out to customer service department 3 times since hitting the threshold and 3 months waiting time period to inquire about the status of my bonus miles. The representatives I spoke to all confirmed that I had indeed met the spending threshold and was eligible for the bonus miles. They assured me that the miles would be credited to my account within a reasonable timeframe. Despite this assurance, the bonus miles have not been reflected in my account to this day. 

Since then, I have made several subsequent call However, no action has been taken to rectify the situation, and the promised miles remain conspicuously absent from my account statement.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","NY","11373","","Consent provided","Web",2023-06-17,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7130122,2023

You will see two balance transfers : one for {$6500.00} and another for {$5800.00}, both are showing as XX/XX/2023. There should have been only ONE balance transfer, not two. The first transfer took my other credit card to a zero balance. The second took it to a negative {$5800.00}. This occurred because when I created an online account, the balance transfer was NOT showing, so I entered it again. 

When I spoke with on of many Barclay representatives over two months, I learned the issue apparently was handed over to another Barclay representative with an Incident number : XXXX. I have had NO contact with this person, only the representatives at the customer service number, who apparently are not able to do anything to rectify the situation. One of the representatives told me the correction would take place within one to two billing cycles. That has not happened as we approach the third billing cycle. 

Because there has been no action in more than two months, I am reporting this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and to XXXX XXXX, so that they have information on how poorly their partner Barclay treats customers. 

So that you understand, I am paying interest on a false balance and my credit has been negatively affected. Barclay had the audacity to email me this week stating thwt my credit score had changed.

I attended the presentation with my fiance XXXX XXXX. The presentation was held in XXXX XXXX, California at the XXXX at the XXXX on XXXX XXXX. Our presentation was at XXXX pm, however we arrived early ( approximately XXXX pm ). The desk/check in agent was named XXXX. He said he would have us meet XXXX, who was finishing up the last presentation. XXXX said that we would just meet with XXXX, and XXXX informed us we would not be attending the group presentation, since we were there so early and he did not want us to wait too long. 

XXXX sat down with us some time between XXXX minuets after XXXX. He asked us several questions about how we travel and what our travel goals were. He explained the benefits and perks of the timeshare program. XXXX of which was a Wyndham Rewards Credit Card. Both XXXX and I stated that we were not interested in a credit card each time it was mentioned. 

XXXX then offered XXXX several point rates. We said we were not interested in those packages and they were out of the range that we could spend. He asked us to fill out a credit check application to see what other options we would have. This was completed on XXXX ' XXXX. He offered us a version with lower points and an mentioned the ability to finance a down payment. 

Following that conversation, XXXX said that our credit came back very good and he would be able to get us completely financed. He said that I needed to verify our eligibility for a loan. ( he always said loan while talking about this part, never credit card ). He sent a link to my phone number ( he had entered it wrong the first time ) and a text arrived at XXXX pm. The text read : """" Hello, XXXX Thank you for considering Citizens Pay to finance you XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
Please click the link below to check your eligibility for a XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX to finance your club XXXX XXXX XXXX 

*Website here* Thank you, XXXX XXXX """" I clicked the link on my phone and filled out a form with similar information to the credit check. As I completed that form I got a verification code texted from XXXX XXXX and put that in the form. 

After completing the form a few moments went by while it verified eligibility. There was a note at the bottom of XXXX of the screens that said this check would not effect my credit history ( paraphrasing here as I can not recall the exact verbiage ). 
At no point did anyone mention that it would or could be be used for a credit card. 

The website stated that I was eligible. Then it showed a loan amount with a slider below it. Under the slider were numbers that showed interest rate ( 22 % ), monthly payment, total cost of loan, total cost in interest and other information provided when you sign up for a loan. There was a large continue button at the bottom. I did not press this button. I closed the website on my phone. 

XXXX and I decided that we did not want to pursue this option, mostly due to the interest rate and the total payments would have been around {$250.00} XXXX and we felt that was too high. 

XXXX had stepped away and when he returned we told him that we decided to decline. XXXX said not to worry, he would get the decline paperwork. He returned with at second person, whose name we can not recall. He had a dark beard and spikey dark hair he was approx. XXXX feet XXXX inches and slender. He brought another lower offer for around $ XXXX and very very rapidly talked about using a the XXXX credit card and the Vacation SideKick programs ( this was a discount program that was part of the perks of the timeshare ) to offset the costs of financing the XXXX program. He mentioned the credit card several times. Each time he brought it up, XXXX and I both said that we did not want a credit card. After he finished his very rapid pitch, I said that was far to complicated and we do not want anything to do with a credit card. He said ok and thanked us for his time and left. XXXX also thanked us for his time and said he was going to go. Another person was going to do an exit survey and then get us our vacation gift for attending the presentation. 

Another gentleman with reddish brown hair, who was about XXXX foot XXXX inches came to the table with a survey. We can not recall his name. He asked us a few questions. He then offered us a temporary membership that included XXXX points, Vacation SideKick that expired in XXXX years. This cost {$2000.00} and would lock in the rates for XXXX years. XXXX and I decided this was worth using this as a XXXX XXXX and traveling. We said yes and I paid with my credit card. 

He said that he was able to use the information in the system from when we input it into XXXX ' XXXX. He sent some documents to sign via XXXX, which arrived at my personal email at XXXX pm. They were sent by XXXX XXXX, who we did not meet. I read and completed the forms. I specifically made sure that I was not signing up for any loans, credit cards or anything with a recurring cost. The forms said that there was no interest rate and no further money required. I completed the forms at XXXX pm. I received an email from XXXX that they had been completed at XXXX pm. 

While I completed the forms, he got us the information for our gift vacation. We completed the conversation and he showed us to a window where XXXX was sitting at a desk. He asked us a few questions about the presentation and our plan. I am not sure what time we spoke with him, but I think that it was approximately XXXX pm. I think I got the email from XXXX at this time. 

At no point did I approve a credit card, was asked to apply for a credit card or was shown terms of service for a credit card.

Because I was strapped for cash I ordered my bank to make monthly payments of {$29.00} to keep this credit card paid up until I could pay it off. 

Today I logged into my account to increase the payments to pay it off as I have the cash now. I see that each month they have added a {$40.00} late fee to my account even though I paid the minimum amount they informed me on my bill in XXXX by the due date each month since then. 

Today I called them and talked to manager XXXX. I asked for the {$40.00} late fees to be removed off my bills. She told me that the {$29.00} was not the correct minimum payment ( even though it appeared on my XXXX bill ) because it did not include additional fees. She also told me that the interest rate was 29 %. 

I want these fees refunded. I also question whether your agency is going its job to allow a 29 % interest rate on credit cards. 

Please respond to my complaint.

2023-10-02,"Credit card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem when making payments","Problem during payment process","I made a 0 % balance transfer on my Barclays Mastercard account in the amount of {$6000.00} on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  which expires XX/XX/XXXX. I have been making payments in the amounts of {$250.00} - {$600.00} or more to pay the transfer balance in full by the expiration date. On XX/XX/XXXX I initiated another balance transfer in the amount of {$1500.00} which expires XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, I had a balance {$3300.00} remaining on the first transfer. On XX/XX/XXXX I made a {$500.00} payment with the expectation of it being applied to the first balance transfer due to expire in XX/XX/XXXX. However, my XX/XX/XXXX statement showed that my 2nd transfer had a balance of {$1100.00} although it had not even been a month since opening it and the first transfer had a balance of {$3000.00} which meant only {$220.00} of my {$500.00} had been applied. When I contacted Barclays, I was told the computer determines how payments were applied since both had a 0 %. I complained at that time they were forcing me to make accelerated payments ( paid {$2500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$950.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ) on both transfers to make sure I did not miss the XX/XX/XXXX expiration and that I should be refunded some, or all of, the second transfer fee since I was not getting the benefit of the promotion. I spoke with multiple employees to include a supervisor about the issue with no resolution and received the same reason that the computer decides how to apply the payments which they can not override, although the agreed with what I was saying. In speaking with customer service in XXXX I was told when within 60 days of the promotion expiration, the payments would be made to the promotion due to expire within 60 days. Yet as mentioned above the XXXX payment didnt go entirely to the XXXX expiring promotion, the computer elected to split the payment. I was also told the balance of on the {$6000.00} transfer was only {$370.00} yet that was not reflected on my XXXX statement. In reviewing my XX/XX/XXXX statement there was a balance of {$840.00} for the first transfer ( not {$370.00} as stated by customer service ), so I made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$950.00} to ensure the first promotion was paid in full prior to expiration on XX/XX/XXXX. I then called Customer Service the same day and was told they saw the payment pending and told me my promotional balance was {$370.00}. It was not until this call that I questioned them about the discrepancy in the amount given by the agent and what was reflected on the statement, because I was assured previously my XXXX statement would have the updated balance. On this call customer service did some research and then told me the statement shows the amount subject to interest if not paid in full but is not the balance of the promotional transfers ( it's not clear from the statement how the balance subject to interest is determined ). I asked for written documentation of my transfer balances rather than having to rely on calling customer service, because the balance subject to interest is meaningless without knowing what balance needs to be paid. I was told that information can not be provided to me, it is only available to the company via their system. I find it COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE to not have written documentation about balances that I am paying on. Additionally, my balance for the {$1500.00} transfer has changed from {$1100.00} on the XX/XX/XXXX statement back to {$1500.00} on the XX/XX/XXXX statement without explanation. I have no idea how Barclays is making decisions on these balances. My complaint is three-fold : ( 1 ) I should be able to have my payments applied, first, to the promotion that expires earliest and then the later promotion when both have the same 0 % APR, not be at the mercy of the arbitrary selection by their computer, ( 2 ) I should have written documentation of the balances I am paying on and ( 3 ) the amounts reflected on my statements have changed without explanation. The current statements are misleading and incomplete which I feel is intentional and designed to make it harder to track timely payments of the transfer balance subject to hefty interest rates if not paid in time.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","GA","30039","","Consent provided","Web",2023-10-02,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7622050,2023

2023-06-27,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem with a purchase shown on your statement","Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement","Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to bring to your attention a credit card dispute I have been facing with Barclaycard regarding a purchase made using my Barclaycard Arrival Plus XXXX. The details of the dispute are as follows : Dispute case XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2022 I made a purchase of a brand new bike on XXXX, utilizing my Barclaycard. However, upon receiving the bike, it became apparent that it was completely unusable and posed a significant safety risk. I promptly contacted the supplier, providing them with photos and videos showcasing the bike 's condition. While the supplier acknowledged the issue, they only offered a meager credit of approximately {$25.00} to cover the repair costs. Given the extent of the damage and the impracticality of fixing it with such a small amount, I repeatedly requested a return instead, emphasizing my lack of time to deal with the matter. 

Despite numerous attempts to negotiate a return, the supplier adamantly refused. Consequently, I turned to Barclaycard to initiate a dispute for defective merchandise. 

After opening the dispute around XX/XX/2022, I received a letter from Barclaycard in XX/XX/2022 stating their """" inability to pursue the dispute due to no second opinion. '' I found this perplexing since I had never been informed about the requirement for a """" second opinion '' during my initial phone call with Barclaycard, where they explicitly mentioned notifying me if any further documentation was necessary. 

This unexpected request for a """" second opinion '' prompted me to contact Barclaycard immediately. They advised that I obtain a second opinion from another merchant or a specialist within the same industry and provide it to them as additional evidence. 

Subsequently, I consulted a reputable bike repair mechanic, who inspected the bike and issued a letter confirming its unsafe and defective condition. The mechanic, from """" XXXX, XXXX, '' concurred with my assessment. I promptly submitted this letter to Barclaycard. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received yet another surprising letter from Barclaycard stating their inability to """" assist with obtaining a credit '' due to """" insufficient proof that the merchant violated the invoice/contract 's terms and conditions. '' It is bewildering to me that they would now focus on the lack of proof regarding the invoice/contract terms when their previous letter did not mention such a requirement. It is vital that Barclaycard communicates their expectations clearly, as I would have readily provided evidence of the merchant 's violation of the terms and conditions. Moreover, the bike I received is unequivocally defective and unfit for purpose, contrary to the advertisement claiming it was in brand new condition. Additionally, the merchant advertised a 1-year warranty. 

Following receipt of this latest letter, I contacted Barclaycard again, only to be informed that they were unable to offer further assistance due to my alleged inability to return the merchandise. I was dumbfounded by this response since the entire basis of my dispute was the merchant 's refusal to accept the return. Returning the defective product was precisely what I sought to accomplish through the dispute process. I have communicated this discrepancy to Barclaycard through subsequent letters, yet they have not taken any action to credit my account for the faulty merchandise.

It is abundantly clear to me that Barclaycard is engaging in evasive tactics. Despite providing all the required documentation and evidence, they have chosen to disregard the information and have taken no action to address the issue. As a result, I am steadfastly refusing to pay the disputed amount on my credit card, which unfortunately has negatively impacted my credit score.

I implore the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to intervene in this matter urgently. The actions of Barclaycard have left me frustrated and without a satisfactory resolution. 

Attached is all the evidence including follow up letters I wrote to Barclaycard re explaining the entire situation and attaching copies of all the evidence including screenshots of the merchant refusing to accept the return of the bike.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","MD","207XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-06-27,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7171463,2023

Then insisted on more cash to get my piano off the truck. They threw my boxes, crushing everything. They broke all my furniture. When I tried to take pictures with my cellphone, I was shoved and they grabbed my phone, deleted everything and threw the phone. I called the police who came. I have a police report. 
When they left, they wanted more cash, but I had none left. The garage door was broken, ending up in an {$1800.00} repair. All of my antiques were smashed and had to be thrown out. Most all of the boxes were crushed and thrown in the garage and I ended up having to hire another company to help me move the boxes to their appropriate rooms. I have pictures of all of this. I have no numbers to call this company! On XXXX XXXX, it says they are out of business and others were scammed by them in the same way. They obviously have my {$4300.00} + cash that I gave them but I asked Barclay to put a stop payment on the {$4100.00}. Barclay originally did, but has since decided to pay them! I don't know how they have any contact information from them. 
I sent Barclay all of the information, the reports, the pictures, etc. about 30 pages of information. The reason they said I still owe them is because they said the company performed their service!!! I asked Barclay who made that decision, and they said I was not privy to that information. When asked to reopen the case with the new information, they sent a letter saying they still would not refund me the money. I don't understand how the moving company can get away with this, which is despicable at best, but more likely criminal. Then immediately after, they stole that credit card number and made fraudulent charges all over the United States so Barclay had to reissue a card ( those charges they withdrew ). MY bigger issue is how BARCLAY is not standing behind me, the consumer, and protecting my rights!!! That is why I need help.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","NC","28451","","Consent provided","Web",2023-06-28,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7174885,2023

The bank sent the updated XXXX to an unfamiliar person with a different address and phone number. At first, I was unaware that my credit card had been stolen and only realized it when I noticed a drop in my credit score and called the bank. However, the bank 's phone line would disconnect automatically all the time, and everyone kept transferring me to different departments. I spent four hours being transferred from customer service to the security department to the fraud department and so on. Finally, the bank gave me an investigation number and said someone would call me back, but no one did. 
Months later, the bank 's collection department called me for payment. I explained the situation to them, but they referred me back to the customer service department, who said my account had been closed and they could not help me. A month later, the collection department called again, asking why I had not made a payment. I had to repeat what had happened, and they said they would send me a statement and asked me to highlight which transactions were not mine and mail it back to them. They said I would receive the statement in XXXX business days, but I waited for XXXX days and did not receive it. The following month, the bank called me again for payment, and I had to explain the situation again. 

Having my credit card stolen was already frustrating, and the fact that the bank was not helpful made it worse. I thought my account activities were recorded in their system, and the previous conversations with the bank were also recorded, but every time their phone line disconnected or they transferred me to different departments, it made me feel that they were not professional. 

Another couple months later, I received a letter from the investigation team regarding they have completed their investigation and have determined the activity is valid. But I received the phone call from collection agency regarding my balance, they said they received the letter from you guys on XX/XX/2023, and my balance is {$2000.00}, which means Barclays did not credit back my credit to my account. I called the bank, but investigation team has no record about this letter in their system, and it is so unprofessional. 

From XXXX to XXXX, I had already wasted so many months being investigated by this bank, and I got so many phone calls from the collection agency.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","CA","91706","","Consent provided","Web",2023-07-06,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7213965,2023
2023-01-12,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Other features, terms, or problems","Problem with cash advances","I have a very serious issue with the Barclay 's AAdvantage card. I have called twice since XX/XX/XXXX, discussed the issue with representatives and was provided with a case number, but was told it would take up to two billing cycles to be contacted by a XXXX which is unacceptable. I received a form letter yesterday ( XX/XX/XXXX ), whereby it states that they understand my concerns and appreciate the time Ive taken to provide valuable feedback however I requested a more direct contact/conversation to rectify this major error to our new account and the standard letter doesnt address my concerns or solve this issue. 

My husband and I traveled on an XXXX flight on XXXX XXXX and was provided with a paper application for the card upon departing from the flight. I completed the application, with a request to transfer {$5500.00} from our XXXX XXXX  credit card to Barclays AAdvantage credit card with the understanding that there would be an introductory 0 % APR for 15 months. I waited over XXXX weeks and hadnt received confirmation via email, phone or the card in the mail. 

My husband and I telephoned on XX/XX/XXXX and was told by a representative that there was NO record of the application. We then initiated with the representative a new application, requesting {$8400.00} ( increasing the {$5500.00} in order to cover our travel expenses ), with the understanding that there would be a transfer fee of {$420.00} and 0 % APR. 

The PROBLEM is that the representative made a significant error and misinformed us as both requests/actions occurred so that we ended up being charged for a second balance transfer for the initial request of {$5500.00} AND a APR charge ( since it was our """" second request '' ). Both transfers were posted on our XXXX XXXX  card on the same day so I don't understand how it wasn't possible for Barclay 's representation to not see the initial application! 

I called twice in order to get this rectified as we DID NOT WANT BOTH, nor pay for the {$5500.00} balance transfer fee and get involved with paying an APR on the amount. In explaining the situation to a Barclay 's representative, I requested the ability to immediately pay off the {$5500.00} balance transfer, but was told it wasnt possible. I dont see how this isnt possible since the finance charge is being charged only on the {$5500.00}. balance and its a matter of crediting our credit card the {$5500.00} amount, as well as the balance transfer fee of {$270.00} in as much as this is an error on their part.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","CT","06405","","Consent provided","Web",2023-02-02,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",6431704,2023

Everything was fine until yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, when I received an email telling me that my bill is due - I'm behind on payments totaling {$57.00}. I checked my orders, my purchases, my checking account, and that number did not correspond to any purchase. I then checked my statement online, only to see that I'm late on my last payment- apparently, Barclays was """" Unable to locate external bank account '' on XX/XX/XXXX, and never informed me. They also removed my bank account information from my profile when I looked further into it. 

I reached out to them and they said I have to turn on email notices and that they have every right to charge a late fee ( and subsequently report me to the credit bureaus ) because they couldn't handle the problem on their end. 

I don't know what email notifications need to be turned on, but I get everything from them. Regardless of whether I want to be signed up for their marketing emails, they should have notified me immediately as to give me an opportunity to rectify the situation. They did not, and they put me responsible for their error. 

This has been an ongoing issue - I had stopped using their cards and left retailers that use their services because of their failure to send statements and notices on time, claims that the customer doesn't have their settings properly configured, and generally horrific customer service.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","NJ","070XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-06-28,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7179946,2023

This all started when one of your representatives accidentally charged me for double my minimum payment. I immediately caught the mistake and I called in. The Barclays representative told me that I have to wait until it posts and then I have to ask my bank to return payment. She assured me many times that this is normal procedure and the only way to correct her mistake. I then did what she said and I had my bank return the payment. I then paid the minimum payment. This incident snowballed, and resulted in a chain of mishaps from Barclays representatives from there. Every time I would call them to fix it I would get a different answer. Every time I spoke with someone they said they were sorry and they would fix the problem and then didnt. The next thing I know I had a missed payment reported to the credit bureau. I have worked so hard in the last 15 years to keep my credit score up and to not miss a single payment. I have had a 100 % payment history for the last decade and now I have a missed payment and 99 % payment history.

After attempting to login to my online account to make payment I was locked out of my account, and soon after I began making my payments by phone. After a while, BarclayCard stopped allowing me to pay by phone, stating that the account was too old and that I would have to make payment via check or money order. Two weeks later managed to speak to a representative who was helpful in assisting me with payment. I made a payment of {$100.00} toward my account balance of {$1200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, which was receipted on XX/XX/XXXX. However, I received an additional statements on XX/XX/XXXX which did not reflect this payment.

However, entirely because of Barclays repeated failure to follow its stated policies and stand behind what its representative assured me by phone would happen, I have been charged {$59.00} in fees plus interest of {$47.00}. 

Twice, I wrote to the company with the details, and both times the response has been a form letter essentially suggesting that nobody cares. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed a check for {$5200.00} to Barclays which more than covered my balance, due 13 days later, on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, Barclays received my check. 
Barclays did not present the check to my bank. 
Barclays did not credit the payment to my account. 
Barclays did not give its own relationship managers any way to know that it had received this check. 

On XX/XX/XXXX when I noticed my payment was not credited, I called and talked to Barclays Relationship Manager XXXX. He advised me to stop payment on my check, which apparently had been lost in the mail. He told me that if the check somehow were presented to my bank and returned, Barclays would waive any fee for that. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I still had no way to know that 16 days earlier, Barclays had received my check. I determined that it had not been presented to my bank, and I instructed my bank to stop payment. This is what Barclays had instructed me to do, and XXXX charged me {$30.00}. 

Later that same day, I spoke to another Barclays Relationship XXXX, XXXX, who told me the check had been credited to my account the previous day. She also told me that Barclays had begun trying to verify the check on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I wrote a detailed letter to Barclays following the instructions for doing so that are printed every month on my statement. In return I received a form letter stating : We are currently unable to complete your request. The letter instructed me to call customer service. 

I did so and spoke with still another Barclays Relationship Manager who told me the {$29.00} returned payment fee was valid and could not be waived. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Barclays charged my account {$47.00} for interest charge on purchases even though my account had been fully current since XX/XX/XXXX. ( One month earlier, on XX/XX/XXXX, Barclays charged me {$130.00} interest. Later, without any explanation, Barclays reversed that charge. ) I have tried to resolve this by letter and by telephone, without success.

Ive raised a dispute with Barclays claiming unauthorized, fraudulent transaction, but the dispute case was closed with the claim that chip card technology was used which can not be counterfeited. 

The investigation by Barclays was clearly inadequate and in violation of Regulation Z and failure to correct this and reporting any delinquencies to credit agencies is in violation of FCRA for the following reasons- 1. I did not receive the original card that was sent and the Bank did not provide any evidence with tracking number that the card was mailed and delivered to me 2. I did not activate the card because it was not in my possession. No evidence provided to prove that Ive activated the card.

3. I do not recognize the purchase and neither did I authorize it. I do not know the merchant and not aware of the products or services provided by such merchant. No evidence provided to demonstrate that the purchase was made by me. The account was only opened with the intent to make purchases at Banana Republic stores. 

4. Claim that chip card technology can not be counterfeited to support the Banks investigation is not sufficient to conclude that no fraud occurred. If the card was mailed, it could have been stolen from the mailbox.

I received notification that my subscription will expire on XXXX XXXX. Therefore, I was quite shocked when I logged onto my credit card account and found a charge for a service that has been confirmed is canceled. I even tried to log onto the service to see if maybe they forgot to cancel me despite the email, but I was not able to logon because I do not have a subscription. 

Therefore I called Barclay cards. That is who the charge was with, and I figured that they would very easily remove the dispute a charge, since I had proof that I had canceled it, and received a verification. What ensued was so awful, and still unresolved, and it leads to a terrible problem with the company itself. First of all, they want consumers to carry the balance of the dispute a charge for 15 days before they dispute it. There is nothing that's going to change between now and 15 days except that I have to remember to come back and do it. I should not be required to carry a false balance on my account when I never carry a balance, all because they don't want to do their job. Over the course of the next hour and a half or so, I was forced to call Barclay, no fewer than five times, where I spoke with up to seven or eight different agents, all of whom claimed they could not see my previous call. I was forced to both tell a bot my verification information, then repeat it again five minutes later. One agent was in a call center or at home on speakerphone, I'm not sure, but it was so loud that when I asked her to speak to a supervisor, or to somehow help my complaint, and was obviously frustrated, she responded """" Ma'am, we do not tolerate profanity. '' I was stunne because I had not used any profanity. But the quality of phone calls was so poor that she couldn't understand some of the words I was saying. I should note that I do not use profanity at all, and I had not even muttered a word as benign as darn, let alone used any profane words. When I protested, she seem to believe me, and realize it had been her mistake, but the fact that it even had to go that far is indicative of the innate problems with this company. They are making it almost impossible to dispute a charge, without a great length of time passing, in which some customers would probably forget that it was there. I tend to pay my balances on a regular basis, so because of that, it looks like I might be paying this balance over the next 15 days and therefore, I'm not disputing it. They need to not only remove this charge from my card, and except the written proof that I have, which no channels even gave me to offer them, and they need to make the dispute process, simple and streamline for all customers. Unfortunately, I have had to dispute charges with other credit issuers, often for similar reasons such as a recurring auto charge after cancellation. NO OTHER ISSUER makes a consumer carry a balance for 15 days first! 

All cards will open an investigation the day the false charge posts. Barclay encourages high balances ( which I never carry ) and has almost 30 % interest rates! I am sure they hope I will forget I have been ripped off. No agent was empowered to help. One hung up accidentally, and a supervisor purposely put me on a long silent hold just to make me wait. I hung up, called and applied with a different card issuer for a different awards card, and will be canceling this as a result. However, these unethical actions must STOP. Further, the false charge is still on my account! They are predators who do not practice ethics, and this is not acceptable. I demand the charges be removed and I will not be calling them again -- except to cancel my card!","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","TX","77845","","Consent provided","Web",2023-03-22,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6726310,2023

I am a single mom with XXXX children. My XXXX youngest kids, then ages XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, went to the presentation with me. The manager gave me amounts for loan payments to buy XXXX points, which he said would allow us a one-week vacation every year. I told him that the payments were too high. He asked me what the amount was that I could afford. He got the payments down to {$70.00} a month. 
I bought XXXX XXXX XXXX points for {$20000.00}. The down payment was {$14000.00}. This was paid with a XXXX XXXX credit card issued when I was there. A XXXX credit card I was not aware of was also opened. I learned about the XXXX credit card when I checked my credit report. The amount financed through XXXX was {$6100.00}. The monthly loan payment to XXXX is {$100.00} per month. Due to the deception, especially about the buyback program, which is nonexistent, I did not make any loan payments and only made a few XXXX credit card payments. 
The manager told me that maintenance fees would be {$90.00} a month. However, to help me out, he said he would gift me XXXX bonus points that he said would cover maintenance fees for up to XXXX XXXX XXXX years as XXXX would redeem the bonus points to offset maintenance fees. 
I was worried about being able to afford the timeshare, considering I am a single mom with XXXX kids. I asked XXXX what would happen if I couldnt afford this. He said there is an option to sell the timeshare back to XXXX at the price that I would be paying for it. 
I didnt really understand timeshare, so I called my sister who travels extensively using her timeshare. I had her talk to XXXX. He told her the same thing he told me, that if at any time I realized it was too much of a purchase, I could call XXXX and they would purchase the timeshare back through their buyback program. 
The reason I did not review the contract right away, to catch the lies told to me about the payment amount and offsetting maintenance fees for XXXX or XXXX years, was because the night that I bought the points, I tested positive for XXXX and drove home the next day. All three of my children came down with XXXX. 
When I got the first bills in the mail in XXXX, it was {$100.00} for the loan payment, not the {$70.00} per month we discussed. There also was a bill for maintenance fees for about the same amount. I called XXXX to ask about using the bonus points to pay the maintenance fees. They told me that bonus points can not be used for maintenance fees. 
I told them I couldnt afford this since I was lied to, and that I needed to proceed with the buyback program. They kept transferring me to other people. Most of the representatives I spoke with told me that XXXX doesnt have a buyback program. I talked to one rep who told me that people get home from vacation and change their minds all the time so canceling would be an easy process. I then got to a department and asked for a manager. The manager stated that she could help me and filed a case for a misrepresentation and my request to cancel. Before I could get a reference number, our call got disconnected. I called back and the rep talked to the manager who told her that she told me that there was nothing that she could do and that I didnt qualify for any of their programs. Ive also been told by reps to either get a lawyer or to go through real estate companies to sell my timeshare. I have learned you cant sell a timeshare with a loan outstanding.

I tried to pay by credit card, but my credit card company ( Barclays Jet Blue Mastercard ) immediately flagged it as a potentially fraudulent purchase by simultaneously sending me text and email messages and calling my cellphone. Instead of dealing with my credit card while struggling to communicate with the attendant in XXXX, I paid in cash. The total was {$540.00} pesos. 

When I returned to the United States, I saw a charge for {$540.00} USD on my credit card statement ( Barclays Jet Blue Mastercard ). Unfortunately, I did not save the receipt for the cash purchase, which my credit card company is requiring for the dispute resolution process.

To summarize, the problem with the charge on my credit card is two-fold : 1. I already paid the full amount of {$540.00} pesos at the gas station in XXXX. 

2. The charge for the gasoline I purchased in XXXX was {$540.00} pesos, which is approximately {$40.00} U.S. dollars. The amount I am being charged on my credit card is {$540.00} U.S. dollars, which is a fraudulent amount.

The reason is that they wanted me to wait ( and I quote ) until I was on default to make payment arrangements ( although I was being proactive and trying to find temporary help to avoid impact to my credit, which has been immaculate ). As a result, my credit report has been negatively impacted and decreased from having an """" exceptional '' credit rating to a """" fair '' credit rating, as a result of Barclays and their inability to work with me before default, which I believe is unfair, violates my rights under FCRA, and gives them a horrible reputation taking into account my current situation both financially and healthwise.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","TX","75062","","Consent provided","Web",2023-10-24,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7751915,2023

Barclay 's accepted my debt repayment plan on XX/XX/2023 ( see attached email from In Charge Debt Solutions ), but failed to change my required monthly payment to the plan agreement of {$39.00}. In XX/XX/2023 ( see attached statement titled Barclay 's XXXX ), In Charge Debt Solutions paid them the agreed upon monthly payment of {$39.00}. At that point, my account went past due because Barclay 's did not change my minimum payment due until XX/XX/2023 ( 4 months past the agreed upon new rate ). 

The monthly payment is now correct ( after I called Barclays several times ), and is paid directly by In Charge Debt Solutions. However, Barclay 's continues to report my account as 60 and 120 past due, when in fact, I have never been late ( see attached statements showing no late payments or past due amounts prior to the agreed upon debt repayment plan ). When I call, the representatives agree with this account and open a new dispute, but the office that reviews disputes continues to state I was past due PRIOR to the debt repayment plan, and refuse to change my status in their credit reporting. I am unable to speak with anyone in the dispute department that handles credit reporting. I have called every month since XX/XX/2023, and they continue to file a new dispute, and continue to reject it without any factual data indicating I was past due prior to enrollment in the debt repayment plan. This is an error on Barclay 's part by not correctly adjusting my monthly payment amount due in XXXX of 2023 ( after agreeing to the new payment amount in XX/XX/2023 ), causing my account to go past due in XX/XX/2023. 

This issue has destroyed my credit, which has always been around 700. I am a home owner and a single mother, and I have worked hard to maintain a good credit score.

I tried using it on a purchase of {$170.00} that I made on XX/XX/2023 so I made a 6-month plan. 

My statement of XX/XX/2023 came with the purchase on it, but because they didn't have an adjusted balance and it was not clear how to adjust the balance myself ( the customer service told me to calculate but by the time the payment for the whole balance was processed ), I paid the entire balance on XX/XX/2023 including the original purchase {$170.00} that I set on the plan. 

According to their wording, the {$170.00} that I paid should have paid off the """" XXXX XXXX '' plan and stopped the interest. Instead, I realized on the statement of XX/XX/2023 that they are still charging interest and it appeared as if the plan was not paid. When called, they told me that they were using the {$170.00} to pay the plan in 6 months and customer service told me that they were going to remove the interest. Today XX/XX/2023 I see that the new statement has one month paid and is charging me {$2.00} for interest, and didn't return me the previous {$2.00} of interest. 

I don't think I should be paying interest on a plan that I paid in advance, that should have been paid off when I paid the whole balance on XX/XX/2023 According to Barclays : """" You can pay your XXXX XXXX  XXXX  early by paying the most recent Statement Balance plus any new transactions that post to your account before your payment is received.

I did not receive my Gift Card although it was marked as complete, so I contacted Barclaycard support on XX/XX/XXXX. At this time I was told that they would investigate the incident and get back to me with a solution. 

I did not receive a follow up, so I called again on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told to call Mastercard to figure out a solution, but after calling Mastercard and realizing they could not help me with Rewards issues through Barclaycard, I called again the same day. 

I was told that they had refunded my account the XXXX points and that it should be in my account within a few days. I stated that I was in a payment program and my account was closed, and asked if it would be an issue. She said it wouldn't be an issue at all. 

I waited a few extra days, and not seeing any points in my account, I called again on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told that indeed the problem was that they attempted to refund the points, but because my account was closed, it was not possible, as I had stated several times that it might be. The woman on the phone then stated she would create a new support ticket and elevate the issue. I stated I did not need the points, simply to get my gift card sent to me. She said they would communicate by mail the solution. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Barclaycard simply stating they could not help me with my rewards issue. I called again that day, was transferred to different departments, and stated that this was not okay and I need a resolution, which would be to resend my gift card. I was told because my account was closed and because it wasn't in """" good standing '' that there was nothing they could do. My points were redeemed and card was shipped before my account was closed and I am in a payment program which has made all payments, although that should not matter anyway, as this was redeemed and shipped before I even closed my account. She stated she would send an email to the rewards department. 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter again stating they would not assist me with my gift card issue.

I previously filed a complaint about AAdvantage 's wrongly charging me for a fraudulent charge of over {$4000.00}. They are now retaliating against me for filing the earlier complaint with CFPB, and are putting a NEW fraudulent charge of a different amount, {$1000.00} on my account. I need your help again with this NEW, and different charge.

This {$1000.00} is a fraudulent charge that I notified them of promptly, a day or two after the XX/XX/XXXX post date, when I first went onto my account after it was posted. They said months ago they agreed the charge was fraudulent and took it off my account. 

Now, after I filed a complaint with you as to a previous charge of $ XXXX, they are putting the {$10000.00} charge back on. In their XX/XX/XXXX letter notifying me that I allegedly owe then {$1000.00}, they state : 1 ) they have conducted a valid investigation - but dont provide any documentation of that, 2 ) they have """" determined '' the charge is valid - without any explanation as to why, and 3 ) claim the merchant company provided """" documentation '' - without disclosing what the documentation is or providing copies. I called their fraud team department to request they provide these documents promptly via fax or email ; they refused. 
The XX/XX/XXXX {$1000.00} charge is fraudulent, which I notified them of promptly. AAdvantage Mastercard assures you on their that you can use your card with confidence because youre protected against fraud if you report it. I did that. Theyre still trying to bully and intimidate me into paying them something I dont owe. 
When I called the fraud team to ask that documentation be emailed or faxed to me ( which they refused ), they told me to work it out with XXXX XXXX. When I reported the fraud to XXXX XXXX, they told me to work it out with my credit card company. Neither company has provided a shred of evidence for the money they claim I owe. 

I would also ask that CFPB look into the question of whether US Barclays AAdvantage Mastercard is incentivizing fraud team employees to send out fraudulent and unsupported demands for payment by offering rewards or bonuses for employees ( or the team as a whole ) for amounts they recoup through the sending of these letters. The complete lack of documentation, and the nonsensical nature of the reasons given, raises the question of whether there is a business practice on the part of US Barclays AAdvantage Mastercard to send out these letters wholesale, to get money out of the card holders who at some point give up and pay even when they dont owe anything, just to stop the harassment. 

BTW, I am a US XXXX XXXXr, having received this honor from President Jimmy Carter in a Rose Garden ceremony in XXXX. I was appointed to the Pennsylvania XXXX XXXX to the XXXX on XXXX and have advised members of the Pennsylvania legislature on bills in my area of legal practice, employment discrimination, and harassment.

The next month I got another statement, and this time with more late fees. I called again and got the same response. To ignore. And that is what I did. Today I got a bill for over {$210.00}. My husband called the bank and was told now that there was a {$2.00} residual interest fee slapped on the card AFTER the card was closed and that I did not see. That fee does not get waived. It grows with {$40.00} late fees added to it. Through that loop hole the bank continues to charge you till you pay up. This is a SCAM!!!

Submitted to CFPB on XX/XX/2023

Account opened on XX/XX/2023by Wyndham/WorldMark when I singed a contract to purchase into a Wyndhams Vacation Club. I thought I was purchasing one thing and received something totally different. It was a bait and switch by Wyndhams salespeople. I was deceived and misinformed as to what I was purchasing. My finances were exploited. It was elder abuse with predatory sales practices by Wyndham. I did not find out the truth of what I purchased until much later. On XX/XX/2023, I filed a fraud dispute case with Barclays Bank for the amount of XXXX that was originally placed on a Barclays Wyndham Rewards Card by Wyndham. I was assigned a case number but given no email or online upload opportunity to send them documentation that consisted of a statement of what happened, copies of emails and other documents. On XX/XX/XXXX they sent me a letter telling me to submit information about the dispute, yet no way to send the information. I was finally given a FAX number and faxed information to them onXX/XX/2023. I received a confirmation that the FAXED was received. When I called them onXX/XX/XXXX, they said they never got the FAX because it went to the wrong department. They gave me a new FAX number and I sent it again on XX/XX/XXXX asking for a confirmation from them that they received it. Never received, but the second FAX went through just as the first FAX went through. I also sent them a package via US Mail with required signature showing that they received the packet. Awaiting a response. I also submitted disputes regarding automatic payments deducted by Wyndham in addition to the XXXX for XXXX for this total amount for each month that includes XXXX XXXX XXXX  It is XXXX, and I have yet to receive anything for my membership purchased in July and nothing that was originally promised to me when I joined. Wyndham also charged XXXX on the Barclays Rewards Card for a gratis stay at a hotel to calm me down so that I would wait until things were set up for me. This gratis stay is still on the Barclays Card and has never been reimbursed by Wyndham as promised. Also, the gratis stay at the Days Inn was also charged on my Barclays Rewards Card. A total of XXXX points was taken off the card to pay for the gratis stay.
I have since closed the Barclays Card and am demanding release of the XXXX and XXXX for the XXXX payments for both September and October. In addition to any charges that I personally placed on the Barclays Card, that I have paid, I have also paid a total of XXXX  toward the XXXX since XXXX XXXX. I want release from the XXXX and reimbursement of the XXXX that I have paid. Barclays has consistently made it very difficult to submit documentation to show fraud on the part of Wyndham/XXXX The important question that Barclays asked was whether or not I had complained and submitted information to Wyndham regarding the deceptive practices of their salespeople. The answer is yes  consistently from the beginning and formally with their resolutions department beginning on XXXX XXXX. Wyndham representatives say it may take months to resolve even though it has been escalated.

DETAILED STATEMENT:

My husband and I came to the sales office on XXXX XXXX XXXX, because we won a free one-week trip tXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  on a spin of a wheel that landed on the free trip. We once had a good experience listening to a Timeshare presentation by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  but we also had a very bad experience with XXXX XXXX XXXX We were very skeptical, but the name Wyndham sounded like it could be legitimate. So, we made the appointment to come in and listen to the sales pitch to get our free trip. We viewed a film and then we were assigned to XXXX XXXX My husband wanted to leave, but I told him I was interested in hearing what the salespeople had to say. There was no interest at first in joining any kind of travel club. XXXX  immediately began talking about how we could go to nice resorts or on cruises if we bought into a club membership. I told her we were not interested in resorts or cruises. She asked what interested us. I told her we like first-class train trips and were interested in business-class flights to Italy, as our daughter lives there, and we like to visit her at least once each year. I told her we just got back from Italy in March and that we were going to Iceland in XXXX. I told her we wanted to book the XXXX XXXX XXXX Canada for XXXX for our XXXX XXXX XXXX and my XXXX XXXX  She told us we could do all of this with a membership at great discount or for free using the credits that came with membership. 
I also told her we like bicycling, and it would be nice to be able to stay at nice hotels while biking in XXXX XXXX XXXX or along the coast. I mentioned that we liked biking over to XXXX XXXX and had thought about staying at the XXXX XXXX XXXX overnight. She said we could stay at the XXXX for XXXX  per night. I was really astounded as the XXXX is very expensive. I said back to her, I can stay overnight at the XXXX for XXXX a night? She said, Yes. She said it was on a sliding scale and that we could stay multiple nights and even for a week for a little over XXXX. 
I then asked her about other places, like XXXX XXXX, where I do a lot of presentations, hikes, and research for books I write. I told her we lost our rental of 14 years and were looking at paying hundreds of dollars for motel stays in XXXX XXXX She said the cost would also be XXXX per night or with small increments for added nights. So, I got hooked on the promises of XXXX hotel stays anywhere, including Italy. I know what I have paid for hotels, and that really sounded like a deal. She said that I would be able to use credits for flights, train excursions, and hotel bookings. She said that membership would be for life, and we could pass membership down to our children. Then she invited in her sales manager XXXX XXXX to join us at our table. XXXX immediately brought out a sheet explaining that membership costs XXXX but because we had come in, he could reduce the price. He mentioned a figure around XXXX, and I said way too much, and we were not interested. Then XXXX asked if XXXX was a XXXX, and he said yes. He was a XXXX XXXX  in XXXX  Then XXXX reduced the price to XXXX if we agreed to purchase a membership that day. XXXXl wanted a copy of the sheet he wrote on, and XXXX made a copy for him. XXXX then took the sheet and went to get a sandwich that they offered him and asked when we were going to leave. I told him I wanted to continue the discussion with the salespeople because I thought it might pencil out to be a good deal.
I explained to XXXX and XXXX that I could be interested. I shared with them that my husband has some XXXX and I wanted to provide some good experiences for him while he could still enjoy them and remember them. I was still not committed because I really was not interested in paying interest on a large sum of money. That is when XXXX said that I would not have to pay interest because the cost could be put on credit cards that were interest free for six months. Then the balance could be transferred to another card so that I would have 18 months to pay off the purchase. XXXX said he would personally call me in January and have the balance transferred so that it would be interest free. I was still not sure, and for over 5 hours they kept pressuring me while my poor husband just kept saying he wanted to leave. He was the smart one.
In a final summary statement I said, if I purchase this membership today for XXXX, I will get everything you promised: hotel stays at XXXX per night at such places as the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX; business-class flights to XXXX  or elsewhere at either highly discounted prices from 45-65% off retail or for free by using credits; first-class train trips for much less than advertised retail or free by using credits; discounted car and motorhome rentals (I told them we had a trip planned to see the eclipse on XXXX XXXX  and that we were thinking of renting a motorhome to drive to XXXX; no interest on payment for 18 months; we could pass ownership to our daughter who would receive the yearly credits; and resort stays anywhere around the world, including our free XXXX week. XXXX and XXXX then said they would each give us some of their own credits to make sure our XXXX vacation was paid for by giving us XXXX credits that would be posted to our account in XXXX  (I found out later this was an outright lie as they did not give us any of their personal credits  the credits are bonus credits that were coming to us because we signed up). 
After more than five hours of haggling, we went into XXXX XXXX XXXX. By that time another sales manager was in the deal: XXXX XXXX XXXX. As we went through the contract and as I asked questions, XXXX began to question if I really wanted to sign. XXXX had taken away the various sheets he had written on with the original price and the discounts on it. I asked him to give those back to me. He wouldnt, but he brought out another sheet and just wrote information about interest free payments. I have a copy of the original price he said we were getting that he had given to Lowell that shows the price before all the discounts were added. The back of the sheet shows how points could be used for business-class flights and hotels. He also wrote that retail prices of other travel trips would be discounted 45-65% off retail prices if purchased through the Wyndham Travel Club. 
XXXX continued to write on my copy after XXXX moved away from us. On my copy he wrote each new price before the next discount was added with each of the older prices lined out, leaving the final price I needed to pay for membership. I believe now that XXXX did not want me to have that copy showing how he discounted every price to the final price. He probably would have picked up XXXX copy, but he had forgotten about it because XXXX was at a separate table being fed sandwiches. 
I found XXXX copy much later in a file at home. This document describes what we were offered: we were purchasing a XXXX package that was the highest tier that was listed for about $XXXX  per credit that equals 60 credits at the Platinum level that would provide everything promised, including hotel stays at XXXX per night. It was later that I learned in an email from XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXXthree months after signing the first and second contractthat the XXXX is the amount per day to use XXXX XXXX and not the cost for a stay. The actual cost to stay in such places, like the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, would be XXXX PLUS the cost of the room. I was totally deceived by all salespeople who were pushing me to sign the contract. I have several emails sent to salespeople reiterating and asking for confirmation that I would only pay XXXX per one night stay. They always confirmed verbally.
When XXXX really questioned if I should sign because I was so unsure, I asked XXXX and XXXX if everything that I was promised would happen, and they affirmed. So, I signed. I later discovered that I did not receive what was promised and presented, which was the Platinum tier at a great discount, but instead, I paid full price for the lowest tier that did not have enough credits to really use as I needed and did not include the personal choice needed to obtain business-class flights or specialized first-class train excursions, such as the XXXX XXXX  all the things that I was interested in that they said I would receive with the discounted membership.
The sales team knew that XXXX and I were leaving shortly for an extended tour of XXXX. No one said anything about having only two weeks to cancel the contract after signing. When I came back from XXXX and really had second thoughts about how I had been so highly pressured into signing, I called XXXX and asked her about canceling. She said I could not because I would have had to cancel within two weeks, and it was then after two weeks of signing the contract. She said I was stuck with the membership. 
I decided to be positive about the membership because I still believed I had everything that was promised to me and would be able to schedule the XXXX XXXX  train trip through Wyndham. I even told the sales representative at XXXX XXXX  that the trip would be booked through the Wyndham travel club that I joined. I began telling friends that I would be able to stay in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and better than that, I could reserve a couple of rooms at the XXXX XXXX when folks were biking with us, and they could stay there also at the highly discounted price. I told my daughter in XXXX that I would pay for flights for her and her husband through our credits to bring them here for XXXX and that we could rent a home or stay at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for several days over XXXX XXXX My son-in-law then put in a request to his employer (he is an XXXX working in XXXX for a XXXX XXXX) to grant him vacation time during the holidays. I believed everything the sales team promised me that they said was true. I had no reason at that time to think anything else except for an uneasy feeling about how they pressured me and hovered over me like a flock of vultures waiting for a meal. Once I signed, they were done with me. The care I was promised never came. They were off to find another victim. 
I now believe they looked at our age, heard me mention that my husband had XXXX XXXX, sensed we had money and credit that they could access and thereby receive a sales commission, and they had assumed I was dumb and gullible enough to be talked into buying a membership. Well, they were correct there. I stupidly believed and trusted what they presented to me. They made it look like a really good deal. But what they had me sign was not the XXXX package discounted. It was the lowest tier at full price. This was a total, unethical predatory sales scam, or elder fraud, based on deception and false pretenses when they saw my vulnerability because of my concern about my husbands condition, my desire to visit our daughter yearly and provide XXXX comfortable accommodations on flights, and my need to have a place to stay in XXXX XXXX that was affordable. 
In signing this first contract, no one told me how my credit score would be affected. It dropped from excellent with over an XXXX score to good with a loss of about XXXX XXXX. I was also told to use the Barclays credit card as much as possible to earn additional travel points, although I really did not understand what that entailed, as it was never explained. What I found out immediately was that I could not use the card at all because it was declined as XXXX was placed on the Barclays card when I signed the contract (THIS IS THE XXXX THAT I AM CONTESTING WITH BARCLAYS). I immediately called XXXX and asked what was going on. He said, just pay XXXX now and they will increase your credit limit so that you can use it. I called Barclays. They said that they do not automatically increase credit. They said that there was nothing in the contract from Wyndham that said I was promised a higher credit limit. It was also a card that needed to be paid off in six months or otherwise there would be charges of 25.24% interest on the unpaid balance. Hassan said not to worry because the balance would be moved to another interest free account. I could see that this plan could become a real nightmare trap that could possibly lead to huge interest payments while my credit score would continue to drop. Again, I would have to trust a salesperson. Now I know I cant trust any of them because they are there to make a profit for themselves and will say anything to get the sale.

It was a targeted promotion advertised on a travel website. My wife and I used the same link, on the same day, approximately one minute apart from each other, when the cards came in my wife received the correct promotional offer but I did not receive what was advertised. Instead I received an offer of XXXX award miles after purchasing {$2000.00} in minimum spend over 90 days. I called Barclays to explain the situation, the agent pulled up mine and my wifes account and said yes, they made a mistake and we can get this fixed for you. A few weeks go by, nothing changes. So we call the company again. This time I speak with a manager who tells me that it is pending investigation and they may or may not fix the issue, and they will do it whenever they get to it. I was not given a time frame. I have called back several times and at least three times have been disconnected with no call back. Once I asked the agent if I could give him my number so that if I was disconnected he could call me back, he said but that he would out a note for someone to call me back. SurpriseI was disconnected again, with no call back. After calling again, I asked to speak with the first agent I spoke with, was told no but was told I would receive a call back from a manager within 24 hours. It has been 48 hours and no call has been received. This is false advertising. I specifically used a link promoting a specific offer and did not receive that offer. My wife has already received her miles award and it has been deposited into her account, but XXXX cant even get a call back or an answer. Their website says they try to handle complaints quickly, but when I call I get a response of we dont know, they usually take several billing cycles if they fix the issue at all. The phone calls are recorded, but we cant ever talk to the same person or find out extension numbers or get call backs if we get disconnected. This feels intentional, and it is false advertising.

I would like to first state that I was not even aware my account was sold to Barclays and thought my XXXX  card was still with XXXX  and kept trying to login to pay MY {$6.00} BALANCE but could not because of the switch.

When I saw that the {$6.00} was not being deducted from my bank account I decided to call customer support to make a payment over the phone. When I called I was made aware that my account was past due and that it was sent to the various credit agencies as a delinquent account. I have never been late or delinquent on my XXXX  account and have impeccable credit. I have worked very hard to get my credit where it is only to be ruined by a {$6.00} charge. I was never contacted that I was delinquent nor did I receive any courtesy calls about this. I ask that this be corrected immediately and that it is taken off my credit as soon as possible as it is unfair! I was told by the customer service representative that I should write a letter to some po box and just wait for a review whenever they get to it.Unfortunately that does not work for me. I will not be held hostage until they get to it and drag their feet in correcting this or for them not to correct it.

I have used my card several times over the past 6 years and have always made on time payments, never had a late payment. I used the lock feature on their mobile app to prevent anyone from stealing my card number and making charges. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received notification from XXXX that my acceptance with Barclay 's had been closed dropping my credit score by XXXX points ( due to Barclay 's performing an unauthorized credit check for an unexplained reason ). I have never had a single late payment on ANY of my credit cards. Why Barclay 's chose to check my credit without obtaining my authorization is beyond me. I called them on XX/XX/XXXX to ask. I was not provided an answer and was told that I had been mauled a letter on XX/XX/XXXX, the same day that the account was closed. I received the letter just today and it mentions that the credit decision was based on inactivity in the past 3 months ( no information about this in any correspondence to me ever ) and high usage on one or more accounts on my credit report. It goes on to say that the consumer agency that provided information that influenced their decision was XXXX ( which also included my current score of XXXX which isn't much different than the score of XXXX XXXX years ago used in approving my account ). Then the letter turns around and makes a contradiction in that the """" reporting agency played no part in their decision and is unable to supply specific reasons why Barclay 's has taken this action ''.

The reason that I believe Barclay 's has made this bad faith decision is because part of my income derives from a public assistance program, namely SSDI. The company has also recently asked my marital status which I found odd.

Upon learning of this unfortunate and discriminatory closure of my account, I immediately called Barclay 's and asked for a clarification on their decision to which I was told that I would receive a letter in the mail. I offered to make an immediate purchase to have the account reopened ( since I wasn't informed that a purchase within 3 months was a requirement ) and was told no and that they would not reopen my account but that I could apply for a new account ( which of course would have a much lower credit score because of a direct result of their decision to close my account ).

I am writing to bring to your attention a matter regarding an unfair credit report entry associated with my account with Barclays, specifically the XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Around XX/XX/2018, I discovered a 30-day late payment reported on my account. This took me by surprise as I have always been conscientious about making timely payments for all my financial obligations. Upon inquiring with Barclays, I learned that the late payment was attributed to an annual fee that had been added to my account. Unfortunately, I had not been alerted to this fee, nor had Barclays sent any communication regarding this forthcoming charge.

I am deeply concerned about this situation for two main reasons : Firstly, the lack of communication on the part of Barclays resulted in an unexpected charge, leading to an unintentional late payment. Secondly, this erroneous report has adversely impacted my credit score, which could potentially affect my ability to secure credit in the future. Please note that my previous payment history with Barclays, as well as other financial institutions, has been flawless. This incident is not indicative of my financial responsibility and commitment.

Despite my attempts to rectify this issue directly with Barclays, an acceptable resolution has yet to be reached. Consequently, I am reaching out to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for assistance in this matter.

In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I have the right to dispute inaccuracies on my credit report. Given that the late payment resulted from insufficient communication from the lender, I assert that the report is inaccurate. Therefore, I am formally requesting an investigation into this matter and the subsequent removal of the 30-day late payment from my credit report.

I have enclosed with this letter pertinent documentation supporting my claim, which includes records of communication with Barclays and a copy of my credit report highlighting the disputed late payment.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau carries the significant responsibility of ensuring fair financial practices, and I appreciate any assistance you can provide in resolving this issue. I am confident in your agency 's commitment to protecting consumers like myself from such misunderstandings and unintentional errors. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your prompt response and am hopeful for a swift and fair resolution to this matter.

As the money from this pre- authorization was never used, upon check-out, the hotel said it was reversing the pre- authorization, and gave me a document ( see attached ) confirming the pre-authorization ( see attached ). However, despite the fact that the hotel stated that the pre-authorization had been reversed, the amount in question remains on my card. In late XX/XX/2023, I called Barclays to file a transaction dispute ( Barclays XXXX XXXX # XXXX ) as to the transaction in question. Barclays and its employees misrecorded the reason why the transaction was being disputed. Barclays put on its records that the transaction was being disputed because I had already paid for same through some other method, when the transaction was being disputed not for that reason at all but simply because the transaction pertained to a pre-authorization ( that unduly stayed on my card ) that the merchant itself stated it had reversed. 

Barclays closed the dispute without even genuinely investigating it, as required by the Fair Credit Billing Act. I then wrote a letter to Barclays to request reopening the dispute, and I presented clear evidence that the merchant itself stated it had reversed the pre-authorization.

This is clear proof that Barclays has not even conducted a genuine investigation ( in addition to the fact that Barclays grossly misrecorded the reason why the transaction is being disputed, as stated above ) as I never alleged that I paid the charge in question through some other means but the transaction is being disputed because it pertained to a pre-authorization ( that should not have stayed on my card ) that the merchant itself stated it had reversed.. 

I have, for the fourth time, written to Barclays to re-open the dispute ( Transaction Dispute # XXXX ), and Barclays has not responded to my fourth request. There is either a persistent clear misunderstanding ( as to why the charge in question is being disputed ) on the part of Barclays ( saiid clear misunderstanding would be due to Barclays own gross negligence in handling my complaint, including Barclays failure to conduct a bona fide investigation as to my dispute ), in addition to clear bad faith and intentional mishandling on the part of Barclays. 

On XX/XX/2023, I called Barclays again and was informed that Barclays did not intend to reopen my dispute regardless of the evidence. This is clearly a violation of the Fair Credit Billing Act, which requires credit card companies to conduct a genuine and bona fide investigation as to each transaction dispute. In this case, it is clear that Barclays never conducted any genuine investigation whatsoever as to my dispute, as Barclays is unable to even furnish the merchants version of the facts, which I repeatedly requested to Barclays.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","TX","756XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-11-12,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7839590,2023

I noticed that my credit reports have been ruined by this company on information that has not been validated. My consumer credit reports have been ruined due to the businesss abusive and deceptive practices. I contacted the credit card agency with a letter regarding my findings and still have not received a response and it has been more than 30 days since the letter has been sent. My complaints were as followed : To whom it may concern : Please note that this is not a refusal to pay off the account but a notice sent as per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692 ( G ) Section 809 ( B ). This notice states that your claim is disputed and validation of the account is required. As I did not authorize consent for Barclays to report anything on my consumer report. Pursuant to federal law 15 U.S.C. 1692 a ( 3 ) When I pulled my consumer credit reports on XX/XX/XXXX I noticed that my credit reports have been ruined by this company on information that has not been validated. My consumer credit reports have been ruined due to the businesss abusive and deceptive practices. I noticed that there were inaccuracies on my consumer reports, such as the balance of {$2400.00} late payments, as well as a closed account by your company. This has destroyed the lively hood for my children and I to live sustainably, such as purchasing a home of our own, and being able to take care of their necessities. This is very disheartening for me and caused a lot of emotional distress for myself and my children. 

This notice is not a request for verification of the account or proof of my mailing address but a request for validation made pursuant to the FDCPA laws. I humbly request that your agency/office sends me valid proof of claim that I am legally obligated to pay you and that late payments were made and updated pursuant to 15 U.S.C 1666B. I am demanding the removal of the negative items if the information is not validated. ( A copy of any sort is not evidence ) The original must be furnished with WET INK SIGNATURE, including 3-308, and 3-302 ) and proof that it is my signature. Pursuant to federal law 15 U.S.C. 1681 as well as the Fair Credit Billing Act 15 U.S.C 1666-1666j., federal law states that you can not report anything adversely on my consumer credit report until the investigation is complete. 


Please provide me with the below-mentioned items : * The amount you claim the XXXX owes you * An explanation showing me how you have computed the amount. 

* Copies of any documents that prove I agreed to pay the alleged amount pursuant to Federal Law UCC 8-315 * Confirmation that the account has not crossed the statute of limitation ( SOL ) period * Evidence of your license numbers and your registered agent. 

I would like to inform you that in case your agency has reported invalidated account information to any of the three main credit bureaus such as XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX, then it will be regarded as a fraudulent action under both federal and state statutes. Due to this reason, if any negative item is reported to any of my credit reports by your agency or the agency that you represent, then I will be compelled to take legal steps against you for the below-mentioned reasons under 15 U.S.C. 1692 ( a ) ( 1 ) as well as the following : *Misuse of my copyrighted property *Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( F.C.R.A. ) *Defamation of character *Violation of the F.D.C.P.A *No consent was given *Invasion of privacy I would like to inform you further that if any action is taken during the validation period which could be regarded as detrimental to any of my credit reports, then I will seek advice about initiating a lawsuit. This includes listing any information on a credit report that could be incorrect or invalidated, or confirming an account as correct when, in fact, there is no provided evidence that it is. 

If your agency can provide me with the requested documents, I will need a minimum of thirty ( 30 ) days to investigate this information, and during this period of time, all collection activities must be stopped. 

Also, I request that you provide evidence that I must pay you in anything other than appropriate commercial paper should the debt be proven valid because, to my knowledge, the U.S. Congress provided the appropriate solution for me to settle my debts via the remedy in House Joint Resolution ( H.J.R. ) 192 of XX/XX/XXXX, under the United States, Public Law 73-10, and Public Law 48 stat. 112 ( among others ). 

If your agency/company fails to respond to this debt validation request within a period of ten ( 10 ) days from the date of your receipt of my notice and affidavit, then the account information must be completely deleted from my credit report, and a copy of such deletion request should be sent to me at once, or I will take legal action. 

I would also like to request, in writing, that no calls should be made by your agency or company at my residence or workplace. If your agency attempts to make unlimited or computer-generated calls to me or any third parties, then it will be considered harassment, and I will have no option but to file a lawsuit. All future communications with me should be done in writing and sent to the address mentioned in this letter. Further, any correspondence must be made in the form of a commercial affidavit under penalty of perjury and sent by certified mail. Any other form of service shall be deemed defective upon its face. 

It would be advisable that you assure that your records are in order before I am forced to take legal action. This is an attempt to correct your records. Any information obtained shall be used for that purpose.

Im having trouble getting a satisfactory resolution to my dispute with Barclays and XXXX XXXX XXXX  over their payment of a transaction I made on the internet which I tried immediately to cancel because it wasnt what Id ordered. 

This whole situation has been very frustrating, time consuming, and disappointing. Please note the number of case numbers, representing people in Barclays Dispute Department that Ive talked to and the number of times that Ive had to repeat my story needlessly. Ive lost faith in both XXXX and my XXXX XXXX Credit Card. 

The XXXX website was flakey when I made my purchase, requiring me to keep replacing the duvet size before I could order. Then when I received the receipt within minutes of placing my order it showed the wrong size which made it useless to me. I responded immediately ( XX/XX/XXXX ) by email to say that it wasnt what I ordered. No response. 

The next day I received an email thanking me for my purchase. I responded ( XX/XX/XXXX ) again saying that this was not what I ordered and that it was not an acceptable change and tried to cancel the order. No response. 

The next day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I contacted XXXX with whom Id made the purchase to ask them to cancel the purchase because it wasnt as requested. It was shortly after that that I registered my complaint with my XXXX XXXX Credit card online. 

Apparently by reporting the dispute to my XXXX XXXX Credit card company XXXX dropped the original dispute. They didnt tell me this.by the way. Which is funny because later Barclays would tell me that I should pursue my case through XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX from Barclays the Office of the President called after I complained to XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX  in XXXX. XXXX had gone to bat for us and relayed our complaint to a higher up which we appreciated. Now doesnt return our phone calls. 

However, XXXX XXXX from the Office of Barclays President said they denied the claim because a ) the vendor had fulfilled their end of the transaction and b ) contacted us twice. Neither is true. 

Not once did I hear from the vendor and no, they did not fulfill their end. All I heard from them were their advertising emails They were notified the item was not what I ordered and chose to not respond. Barclays chose to take their word over mine, a long time XXXX XXXX customer and card holder. 

If you check the USPS timeline youll see that the package wasnt accepted for shipping until XX/XX/XXXX and probably not shipped until XX/XX/XXXX. Again the XXXX timeline will also tell you that I didnt receive the package until XX/XX/XXXX and without opening it refused the delivery on XXXX  for which I have a USPS receipt.. 

XXXX XXXX from Barclays informs me that XXXX had received the package and they say they couldnt accept it because of the pandemic. So Im out {$120.00}.

2023-09-06,"Credit card","Store credit card","Problem with a purchase shown on your statement","Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card","Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I regret to express my dissatisfaction with the Barclays Bank credit card service. My recent experience has left me profoundly disappointed, and I feel compelled to share my concerns. 

Firstly, I encountered a significant issue when my initial credit card failed to arrive. To exacerbate matters, I discovered an alarming {$1000.00} in fraudulent charges on my account, despite having only authorized a {$55.00} purchase. This situation prompted me to contact Barclays Bank customer service, and regrettably, I found myself subjected to extended hold times during these calls. 

Subsequently, Barclays Bank issued a replacement credit card on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, and I promptly reported the fraudulent charges. I was assured that the new card would arrive the following day, Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately, it did not arrive as promised. My frustration grew when I called again, only to be informed that the card would be delivered today, Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, which, once again, did not happen. 

I must emphasize my disappointment with the lack of communication from the institution throughout this ordeal. I have yet to receive any notifications via email regarding the status of my credit card delivery or the resolution of the fraudulent charges. Such notifications are fundamental to a professional and reliable banking service. 

This unfortunate experience has compelled me to question the professionalism and reliability of Barclays Bank and GAP Credit Card. It is the first time I have encountered fraud, and I find myself reluctant to recommend this bank or its credit card services to anyone based on this distressing encounter. 

I requested Barclays Bank a prompt resolution to this matter, including the delivery of my credit card and the resolution of the fraudulent charges. Clarity and transparency in your communication would also be greatly appreciated. 

I kindly request that Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter promptly and take the necessary steps to rectify the situation. I also request that you keep me informed of the progress and resolution of this complaint. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a swift and satisfactory resolution.

On XX/XX/XXXX, my wife and were taking a flight home via JetBlue, and per usual we were being hassled into applying for their card. After many attempts to decline the offer, the representative remained predatorily persistent, stating that the card would offer amazing benefits like 15-months XXXX percent intro on purchases & balance transfers, JetBlue miles etc. 

We decided to apply and got approved. After receiving my card in the mail, on or around XX/XX/XXXX, I called the customer service number to confirm that my zero percent APR on purchases was valid. The Barclays representative confirmed that this was true, so I proceeded with adding my checking account for auto-pay for peace of mind. 

I went ahead and started spending on my card, with the confirmation and intention that I wont have to pay any interest for the next 15-months. When I reviewed my statements on or around XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed I was being charged 20+ % interest. I reached out to Barclays immediately, after being transferred back and forth no one was able to assist me nor took ownership of their error. The rep mentioned they would have a manager call me back and no one did. I called back several times, again same story, the rep mentions a manager will call back yet no one did. 

Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX I got a hold of a manager who suggested I write to the office of the XXXX XXXX XXXX, Delaware. I wrote them a letter stating the wrongful interest on my account. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a voicemail from Barclays acknowledging that they received my letter and were reviewing my account. Until today I have not received any response and the wrongful interest keeps accruing on my account. I have made several more attempts to reach out and its the same circle of a manager will call you back and no one ever does. Barclays has handled this ignorantly and unprofessionally.

The person on the line presented themselves as such and took my credit card information, name and that of the other passenger, address, phone number, email, passport numbers, and copy of my drivers license. I received a """" XXXX XXXX Booking Confirmation '' with the salutation """" Greetings from Flight Support, '' giving the flight details. It appeared to me to be a receipt and an itinerary from the official airline. I have a copy. 

I did not know until XXXX upon checking my Barclays statement online that there was no sum posted from XXXX XXXX. There were, however, four charges pertaining to travel that I did not recognize. These were : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}, XXXX XXXX for {$1100.00}, another for XXXX XXXX for {$1100.00}, all posted XX/XX/XXXX, and the last for XXXX XXXX for {$1700.00}, posted XX/XX/XXXX. I called the number given by Barclays for what I understand now to be for disputes and was told to call the merchants despite being very clear I had never heard of any of them. Additionally, I informed multiple of the XXXX Barclays representatives with whom I interacted that I had called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX informed me that a booking had been made in my name on XX/XX/XXXX but cancelled a few days later ( XX/XX/XXXX, I think ) because the money had not been received. 

I called all of the entities as Barclays required me. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX assured me there was no problem but could not find any of my information given in their system, spoke in circles about possible trip taxes and could give me no other information. XXXX XXXX had no record of my name or any purchase. The agent from XXXX XXXX, XXXX """" XXXX XXXX '' ( phone : XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX ) assured me there was no problem, and that he could rebook me. ( He sent me a copy of the photo of the drivers license I had sent to what I thought was the XXXX XXXX site, so I assumed he was involved with the earlier issue. ) A subsequent check with XXXX XXXX indicated a second reservation was made ( by a third party, not myself ) but then dropped for lack of payment. 

I called Barclays back and explained what happened, emphasized my belief that I was a victim of fraud. I spoke with at least 5 representatives in succession, became increasingly confused and of the opinion my concerns were not taken seriously. I am XXXX, and feeling extremely vulnerable at this point. 

I was told that for a couple of billing cycles I would not be held responsible for the charges as they would be investigated. Since then I have received two identical letters from Barclays regarding the {$100.00} charge to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX describing it as a dispute and saying it is being investigated. There is nothing about the other charges. I consider them all to be fraudulent. I was obviously deceived into thinking I was working with XXXX XXXX when I first attempted to book, and I personally learned from XXXX that XXXX never received a cent for the attempted bookings, which was why they were dropped. 

As I noted, I am XXXX, and in a vulnerable group for such fraud. Looking back, I think it is pretty obvious given the four unrecognized travel related charges came at the same time and nothing was paid to XXXX despite claims to have done so by the one """" XXXX XXXX '' of XXXX XXXX. 

The various Barclays representatives seemed oblivious to my dilemma, were extremely lacking in common empathy or interest, difficult to hear over the telephone due to back ground voices and foreign accents. The fact that one charge is regarded as a dispute, and I haver received nothing in regard to the status of the others is most disconcerting. 

Meanwhile I did use my Barclays card with a new ID number to book the same XXXX flights as before with the real XXXX ticket agent for significantly less, and the charges appeared on my statement very quickly. I have also filed a police report in order to change my drivers license number.

Shortly after opening the account, in XX/XX/XXXX, I received an offer for 0 % interest for 14 months on all balance transfers. After reading the terms and conditions I was quite confused and called the customer service number provided on my card. Namely, I did not understand how interest would be applied to purchases versus the balance transfer. In other words, would I see two statements, one with the balance transfer amount and a 0 % interest rate v. Purchases amount with the 24 % interest rate. The representative explained that once I initiated the balance transfer my interest rate would drop to 0 % for BOTH purchases and the balance transfer. I confirmed this was the case over and over with the rep during the nearly 10 minute call as I recently moved into a new home and had significant purchases to make for the home. Based on the the representatives statements, I spent nearly {$10000.00} on the card. I would never have done so but for her continued promises that I would have a 0 % interest rate on purchases. Indeed, it makes sense as I could have spent this amount on another card and just transferred that amount to my Aviator card and captured the 0 % interest. 

Subsequently, after I made the purchases, I checked my online account and saw that the interest rate was still 24 % on purchase. I immediately called customer service who told me, in sum and substance, our rep was wrong but we are not going to honor what she told you. I begged that they please listen to the call and call me back. They promised to do so and call back in 48 hours. 

The next call I received was simply horrible. This third representative had not listened to the original call, as promised, and essentially told me too bad you are stuck with this interest rate and there is nothing she could or would do. She also refused to provide me with a copy of the original phone call. I reiterated that I wanted a copy of the original call and to speak with someone who had actually listened to the call, as promised. Absent honoring those simple requests, I would pursue a complaint with appropriate agencies to protect my rights as a consumer. She told me someone would call me, again ; I have yet to receive any further calls. 

I am a XXXX XXXX and fairly sophisticated in reading and interpreting contracts. The terms and conditions presented were so confusing, hence my call for clarification. If I could not understand the terms and conditions, I assume it would be quite difficult for the average consumer. I emphasize I would have never spent thousands of dollars on this card but for Aviator Mastercards false representations that my interest rate would be 0 % on purchases for 14 months. The failure to honor this is fraud which is going to cost me dearly and put me in a very bad place financially. I respectfully request that the company be forced to honor the 0 % interest rate promised until XX/XX/XXXX on all purchases on my card following the balance transfer.

The attendant tried to charge my XXXX XXXX XXXX and it was flagged immediately via text to my phone for fraud. The attendant also claimed the card was declined a twice, however I didn't yet realize they were lying and charging the card because I had initially approved the security text. I took my credit card back from the attendant and paid the gas bill with cash after they tried two additional credit cards of my wifes. Her cards were also flagged and she replied to her security texts that they were valid so the charges would go thru, however the attendant ( unbeknownst to us ) lied again and said they charges were being declined and kept asking us for other cards or cash. We realized we were being scammed and offered to pay in cash XXXX XXXX. They also decided to tell us the amount of gas they had pumped was over {$70.00} US, but we only need less than a 1/4 tank to fill the car as were were just topping off on our way to return the rental car to the Airport. They had 3 attendants in front of us yelling and threating us and telling us we need to give them more money and as the situation progressed to get more and more threating, they stole another {$20.00} US bill right out of my hand. They refused to give a receipt we said we were not giving them any more money and said we were leaving. ( this was a very threating situation at this point ). 
The charge was {$990.00} which would clearly be way more gas than anyone could fill up at any gas station. Clearly this XXXX XXXX is Scamming people. My wife and I immediately returned the car and went to the airport to catch our flight, but before boarding we immediately called all three credit card companies to alert them of what had just occurred. I was assured that the charges would not go through from the SERVICE REP. When I returned to the XXXX  and I called XXXX XXXX XXXX to review the issue and to see if they would be canceling the card and sending a new card. The representative did send me out a new card. When I received the new credit card it had the same numbers as previous card. I called to customer service to activate the card and to confirm that the previous representative that I had already spoke to a few days earlier had done the correct procedure. I went over all the charges again and situation with the SERVICE REP and they said that the charge would be removed within a few days. The charge was removed, but when paying my statement that month I notice the charge was re-applied on my XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and had to call customer service again. Now since last XXXX I have been given the run around from Barclays over 25 different phone calls, being transferred back and forth over 50 times from Disputes and back to Fraud. I have done everything their company and representatives have asked including sending letters of explanation, faxes, pages and pages of XXXX report of 100 's of consumer being ripped off and accosted by this exact same XXXX XXXX. I even sent them ( at their request ) proof of my wife 's two credit card charges being immediately reversed. I've sent them the address of the gas station, I have continued to follow up with this matter every month for the past 9months. I am always told that they need a copy of a receipt for the cash that we paid, while neither of my wife 's credit cards that were fraudulently charged asked for this. I explained over and over the situation and how we were refused a cash receipt. After months of calls, email, faxed and mailed letter, I decided that we should request the XXXX XXXX per our Credit Card Contract. On XX/XX/XXXX I followed the instructions per the contract and faxed and mailed the XXXX XXXX request ( as this was the only method given ) and we have never received a response. I have tried to reach out via XXXX as all attempts via phone, fax, mail have gotten us no where. Today I tired calling the phone number that I receive from an automated response from XXXX as I thought maybe by some chance it would be different, but no luck. I was told their was not one to help, I was told their were no Managers available to talk with, I was told so many excuses of why they couldn't do anything, then transferred from Fraud to Disputes AGAIN! I went over the entire history again with the new representative who confirmed she was in the XXXX and said the screaming baby I had to listen to in between her broken XXXX was a neighbors cat. She tried to tell me that our case had been closed so the XXXX XXXX request was probably archived!?!?!?! 
This was her only excuse she could some up with for us being ignored for complying with every request given by Barclays including our rights to XXXX XXXX. 
We are excellent customers, pay our cards off every month and have never been late and this is the treatment we receive. We have paid the cards off and would like to cancel both my and my wife 's accounts but not until this is resolved professionally. I am happy to provide copes of all the letters, faxes and requests.

I thought there was no annual fee but apparently there was no annual fee in the first year but there was in each year thereafter. I made a few purchases on the card in XXXX and paid them when they became due. 
In early XX/XX/XXXX I received a statement dated XX/XX/XXXX advising me that I was to be billed next month for an annual fee of {$99.00}. The statement went on to state : """" You may choose to call us at XXXX within 45 days of receipt of this notification to discuss alternative products that may be available or to close your account so that the fee will not be billed. '' My wife and I each thought the other had called to cancel the card but when I received a download into my accounting software of an annual fee charge I realized that the account had not been cancelled. I immediately called the number on the statement and asked to cancel the account. The call was made on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX and I spoke to XXXX. After checking with his supervisor, XXXX advised me that I would have to pay the annual fee and that the bank would mail me a check to refund the fee within 60 days. I pointed out that the bank 's own notice said that if I called within 45 days ( I called within 32 days ) that """" the fee would not be billed ''. In response I was told that since the fee was already on the XXXX statement, I would have to pay it and that the bank could not reverse the charge. In addition the bank advised that if I didn't pay the charge by the due date I would be assessed a late fee and interest. Since the bank will not honor its own written notice, I have no confidence that if I pay the annual fee that I will receive a refund based on an oral promise made over the phone. Also, loaning the bank {$99.00} for two months is not fair since they promised to not assess the fee if I called within 45 days which I did.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","AZ","850XX","Older American, Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2023-04-07,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6809262,2023

2023-08-09,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem with a purchase shown on your statement","Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement","On XX/XX/2023, I purchased an airfare ticket from a website known as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX using a credit card issued to me by Barclay Cards U.S. ( hereinafter Barclay ) account ending in XXXX. Immediately following the purchase, the website delivered an itinerary for a travel on XXXX XXXX XXXX  out of a local Airport : XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). See Exhibit A, page 4. That itinerary directs me to an airline called XXXX XXXX at XXXX, which would supposedly take me on XX/XX/2023 from XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) after which another airline XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX would take me from there to XXXX, XXXX for a final destination in XXXX, XXXX. Id. 
On XX/XX/2023, I went to XXXX but could not locate the airline that the itinerary referred me to. The airport security/information informed me that my itinerary was a hoax and no Airlines with that name exists. When I did further investigation, I discovered that the itinerary was indeed bogus as a XXXX XXXX has no presence in XXXX. That is, XXXX directed me to check in with a fictitious airline or an airline that does not exist. The fictitious flight was set to depart at XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX time. I arrived there at XXXXXXXX XXXX I attempted to call XXXX but their customer service was not operating. XXXXorth mentioning that their customer service number shows a California area code, which would make it XXXXXXXX XXXX California time. I then attempted emails but XXXX did not respond until later in the day. See Exhibit A at 2. 
In response to my dispute, XXXX fabricated an itinerary that shows a different airline than the one they sent me. It shows XXXX XXXX instead of XXXX XXXX. See Exhibit C at 9. Their entire case rests on that fabricated itinerary, which would place me at fault for supposedly missing my flight. Their entire defense now is that I missed my flight on XXXX XXXX, which according to them would forfeit my entire purchase. However, later on that evening, XXXX sent me an email stating that the flight that would supposedly take me to XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) was cancelled. Exhibit B. 
In any event, after a string of email exchange, XXXX finally agreed to refund me but failed to do so within the time they promised. See Exhibit A at 1. Following that, I contacted Barclay ( on or around XX/XX/2023 ) to request a reversal of charges. On that call, I furnished Barclay with the same information list in this complaint. I also informed them that I would be ready to support each one of my statements with supporting evidence. 
On XX/XX/2023 Barclay sided with XXXX, without even giving me a chance to respondstating that they were not provided with proof that the merchant agreed to refund the credit card account. [ and ] The merchant has not violated the terms and conditions of the sales agreement. Exhibit C at 1. In reaching that decision, XXXX relied on the fabricated itinerary that XXXX sent them, which they forwarded to me after blindly taking their side, substantiating their fabricated evidence, and denying mine. Exhibit C at 9. 

On XX/XX/2023, I responded with the refuting evidence shown here as Exhibit A to prove to Barclay that XXXX has agreed to refund me, which would address the reason they cited as grounds to deny my request. That information would also show that the information that XXXX provided to them was bogus and differ from the one they sent meat least the ticket and itinerary information. Still, Barclay refused to accept any of the evidence I provided. 

On XX/XX/2023 Barclay sent another statement citing different reasons other than the one they cited on XX/XX/2023. See Exhibit D. This time Barclay added a new reason not listed in their first response. Here, they indicate that needed to see a cancellation evidence. Id. Clearly, Barclay continue cite generic grounds find more excuses to deny customer requests. 
Barclay generic statements dont address issues or respond to consumers claims. For example, even though I informed Barclay that XXXX sent me a bogus itinerary, they sent me a generic response that made no sense. Clearly Barclays generic response was not tailored to my specific case. 

Barclay has a history of siding with fraudulent and predatory merchants. A glaring Example is their previous denial of a similar fraudulent transaction, which necessitated the intervention of a state court. Even then, Barclay, refused to honor the Court order. Clearly, Barclay, in particular, operates with a complete disregard to consumers rights and should be held responsible. should this agency require information on the previous fraudulent charge that had been resolved by a state court, I stand ready to provide the documentation. 


I respectfully request full investigation of Barclay Cards and applying the law to its fullest extent. I also respectfully request investigating XXXX fraud and holding them responsible for their fardauelent transaction.

I called Barclays again on XX/XX/XXXX, once the charge had cleared the account, and they told me I still could not dispute it for 15 days beyond XX/XX/XXXX because I had authorized it as a recurring charge. I said I had not authorized a recurring charge because I had cancelled by policies on XX/XX/XXXX and I did not give approval for XXXX to further charge my account. There is no current authorization in place for any recurring charge for XXXX. 

I was told by Barclays that I had to dispute the prior charge made in XXXX. This can not be the correct advise because 1 ) the change made in XXXX by XXXX was correct as my Insurance policies were in force at that time, as I did not cancel them until XX/XX/XXXX, and 2 ) The amount, should I dispute it, would be incorrect because I am disputing a charge of {$410.00} made on XX/XX/XXXX, not the charge of {$340.00} made on XX/XX/XXXX. There is little point in disputing a charge for which there was a recurring agreement in place for a correct amount when I want to dispute a charge for which there was NOT an agreement in place for an incorrect amount. I declined to dispute the amount charged in XXXX because that charge is not in dispute. I was told this was my only option or wait for 15 days. Barclays are advising me to incorrectly dispute a valid charge. How ridiculous. 

I asked the representative to show my the procedures that indicate a consumer may not dispute an incorrect, and fraudulent charge for 15 days and I explained this was the second time that I had called and this was not explained to me the first time. She told me it was coming up on the customer web page dispute screen. Well, that all well and good but I asked to see the written procedures that explain why I can't dispute a charge made to my account without authorization for 15 days because XXXX do not have any authorization from me to charge my account as I have no policies in force. I don't much care what a XXXX XXXX has written on a website screen. I'd like to know why I can't dispute a charge for which there is no recurring agreement in place, and I know there is no recurring agreement in place because I do not have any insurance policy in force with XXXX and I did not agree to them renewing my policy and charging my credit card, I'd like to know why I am being held to 15 days in order to report this fraudulent charge. 

I asked to speak to a supervisor and no supervisor was available. I was given a case number, and the charge remains on my account.

So 2 phone calls to Barclays and no resolution. And it would have got so messy if I had agreed to dispute the prior charge made in XXXX which is what I was advised to do.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","SC","29715","","Consent provided","Web",2023-02-07,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6543868,2023

My complaint is this : Barclays has erroneous information attached to my account information in their files. I have never had a bankruptcy of any kind. It is curious to me that they claim that I have, when none of my credit reports show ANY adverse reports, let alone a bankruptcy. 

Barclays clearly isn't interested in responding to consumer inquiries or providing a mechanism for correcting information in their files. They only accept voice mails, and then many days pass before returning a call, if at all. They have never provided details of the bankruptcy they claim, such as where it was filed and so forth. They do not seem to be interested in the least in working with me to correct their information, or short of that even speaking with me about the situation. 

Though this information is incorrect, and obviously so, that it is in their files concerns me that the error may spread to other databases if it is not corrected now.

2023-12-14,"Credit card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Fees or interest","Charged too much interest","I have a Mastercard XXXX XXXX XXXX  credit card for several years and always have paid the monthly balance in full. Recently, I agreed to transfer {$6500.00} to their 0 % promotional line of credit at a {$260.00} fee and I continued to use this card for other purchases. In XXXX, my credit card statement showed an interest charge on new purchases. I called to tell Mastercard that I paid in full all new purchases as I have done for several months. They initially say there's interest charge because of new purchases are accuring interest at time of posting the charge which never happened in the past ( but they ignore that fact ). When I speak with the supervisor, they say the interest charge is due to not paying 2 consecutive months payments in full up to that date of payment. So now I'm told in order to avoid a monthly interest charge on new purchases, I have to pay my monthly new purchases balance listed on my credit card statement as I always do PLUS I have to call them to get my current balance of new purchases as of today and include that amount on my payment. If I pay that total balance two months consecutively, then they will not continue to charge a monthly interest charge on my non-promo balance. I've called 3 months in a row to get this resolved. I even spoke with a supervisor and said if I pay x this month, then next month you will not charge interest, she said yes but I was still charged interest the next billing cycle. I'm frustrated with this operation and have only experienced this issue after signing onto the 0 % promotional interest rate. Although, I look closely at my monthly expenses, I'm concerned if other people who have the promotional rate are being charged this new purchases monthly interest and not noticing plus I'd like to avoid making this monthly call.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","NJ","07040","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-27,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",8002826,2023

My problem is that it incorrectly reflects on my credit when it comes to credit percentage utility and and available credit. It artificially looks like im using the credit and leaves me unable to use credit or take advantage of current promotions like 4 % back on groceries.

I've not had a payment returned and I simply asked Barclay to remove hold and what i can do to prevent this. They sent generic response and after stating I will contact CFBP to ensure my rights they want to schedule a call. I just want t be able to plan accordingly plan using my credit.

I applied and was granted the Barclays Mastercard credit card. 

Then, to my surprise, I learned that somehow Barclays Bank, went into my XXXX XXXX  XXXX account, and took out a {$200.00} transfer transaction, completely without my authorization. Barclays also charged the {$10.00} transfer fee. 

Note : I have a degree in Finance, with a year of XXXX XXXX, so with Barclays ' APR at 28 % there is no way XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I would proceed with a bank transfer at 28 %. 

Facts Continued : When I discovered this theft & fraud, I immediately closed the account, and called the Barclay 's Fraud department. At first, I talked to a very rude agent named XXXX who refused to help, giving excuse, after excuse and then refusing to transfer me to the fraud department, I eventually XXXX the information. 

Now, as of today, the {$210.00} has increased to {$400.00}, reported to the payments, while Barclays say they investigated and they saw nothing wrong. And I have no due process appeal rights. 

I will not be making any payments to the closed account. And I am filling a formal complaint with the Delaware AG 's office. 

VERY unhappy past Barclays customer.

I faxed the documents to Barclay several times, then they asked me to mail the documents. I mailed the documents and they have received the documents. Then they directed me to a lawyer to discuss the case. when I spoke to Barclay Lawyer, he said that he has been waiting for Barclay to send him the statement for over XXXX weeks, but they did not send him the statement yet. When I called Barclay and asked why they did not send the debt statement to their lawyer, they have no answer to tell me the reason. It has been over XXXX months since I have been calling them every alternative day and every time they make lame excuses. I don't know why they don't want to resolve the issue when I am ready to settle the case. I have had a buyer waiting for my property for XXXX months.

After XXXX months of contacting Barclay, I feel helpless/hopeless and CFPB is the only hope who can help me by investigating Barclay. Please inquire about this case as soon as possible, so that I would sell the property. I shall be grateful to you.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

It is clear that Barclays customer service has not done their jobs correctly, and that our claims that we did not initiate or complete this purchase are being ignored.

During the past 2 years I have made steady progress, paying off almost all the debt incurred during these past years. Once I felt I had payed off enough of my credit card debt with two different companies and could work something out, I reached settlement agreements with both of these. 

The first agreement was a 4 payment plan that would pay off around 55 % of the debt at the moment, I held up my end of the deal and after the last payment I received a letter from them confirming that """" We received your final payment, and you have completed the terms of your settlement agreement. """". 

Nonetheless, I never received any such communication from the second credit card company. After complying with a 3 payment plan ending in XX/XX/XXXX, I proceded to call them and ask why. I was then told that I hadn't complied with the agreement, which I completely disagreed on. After many, many phone calls and many, many hours devoted to solving the mystery ; I was told that the 2nd payment was made for {$300.00} instead of {$350.00} and therefore, I had failed to complete the settlement. They said that they would open an investigation and get back to me with the results in 24-48 hours. They never got back to me. 

I proceded to call again and -after the mandatory 2 hours and 4-5 handoffs from one agent to another and from one department to another- I was told that they had listened to the recording of our initial phone call and that the agent had said the amount agreed for the last payment was in fact a {$350.00} final payment. They added that I had only payed {$300.00} and was in default. Since I never made any payment myself because it was automatic deductions from my bank account, I let them know I was in complete disagreement and would call back at another time as I'd already spent hours that day on the phone in an attempt to clarify the situation. 

I called again and again and finally on the XXXX of XXXX, XXXX, after I spoke to more than 6 agents I was handed off to a Supervisor who, once he learned that I wasn't making payments at all rather undergoing automatic deductions in my bank account ; said he would find a resolution to this case. He said he would try and do so before that Friday because he would be out on paternal leave after the end of that week. He continued to say that otherwise I would receive an answer before the XXXX of XXXX, XXXX. I never got an answer that time either. 

To my great surprise, I received a letter from said company billing me for the account 's balance ( the same amount that would be condoned after making the agreed 3 payments ). I called again today Monday XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to 4 different agents, I spent approximately 4 hours on the phone. I was told the would reopen an investigations they felt that my case had been mishandled. I went ahead and asked they stop their collection attempts and any reporting to credit agencies until the investigation was clarified. I was told that they wouldn't do that. I asked when I would have an answer to the investigation, since I have increased my credit score by approximately XXXX points in the past months and would not want to put that at risk. I was again told, they couldn't give me a date. 

I asked for the name and phone number of an agency or organization that I could contact in order to file a complaint, I was denied that information and told to go get it on my own by the rude, disrespectful, impatient collection department supervisor. 

Here are the facts : 1 ) I had a credit card with the company.

2 ) I had a debt with said company.

3 ) I reached a Settlement Agreement with them.

4 ) I received a letter from them stating the following : """" Hi. We are confirming your authorization to deduct funds from your bank account to pay your XXXX Rewards Mastercard  Account. 

Here are the details of those payments. Please keep this letter for your records. 
XXXX {$600.00} XXXX {$300.00} XXXX {$310.00} '' 5 ) I kept my end of the deal and kept sufficient funds in the bank account I offered for the automatic deductions agreed upon in our Settlement Agreement. 
6 ) The 3 payments were deducted from my bank account. 
{$600.00} on XXXX XXXX, XXXX reference # XXXX {$300.00} on XXXX XXXX, XXXX reference # XXXX {$310.00} on XXXX XXXX, XXXX reference # XXXX XXXX ) After not receiving a statement from them confirming full payment as per our agreement, I called them. They stated I was in default for not complying with the right amount in the 2nd payment. I explained our agreement was made so that automatic deductions were made, they took the money from my bank account. I didn't make a mistake in payment, they made a mistake in deduction. told them I even had a letter from them saying the 2nd payment was for {$300.00}. 
8 ) They have told me that they agree with my interpretation but they can only ask to reopen the case. Case was reopened today.

9 ) I asked they stopped collection attempts and especially reporting to credit agencies, as the case was being investigated. They denied my petition.

10 ) Any negative remark to credit agencies will most definitely interfere with my credit score progress and on-time payment history. 
11 ) I ask you listen to my complaint and provide assistance, an adversative procedure within the Credit Card company 's bureaucracy is a one-sided process with next to nothing in terms of recourse or options for a consumer.

12 ) This establishes a very dangerous precedent for consumers when confronted with Credit Card companies where they -even when charged with the responsibility of making the proper deductions- can purposefully deduct any smaller amount with the aim of putting your Settlement Agreement in default. This would cause the following : baiting consumers into agreements that involve making payments totaling approximately half the debt in just 3 months with the false promise of erasing full debt. Going after those same clients and asking for the remaining balance based on a false premise of breach of contract. 
13 ) In my case the deduction was a mere {$50.00} less than what they say it should've been. Nobody in his right mind would pay 50 dollars less on a {$1200.00} balance and risk paying more than twice as much later.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","PR","009XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-04-24,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6883542,2023

Upon arrival during normal business hours, I saw that the store was closed with a sign that provided a phone number for a representative to open the store. I called and spoke with XXXX XXXX, the store owner, and she asked that we meet her at the front door so she could open the store for us. We then found the parts ( trucks ) {$64.00} and went to the register to process the purchase. However, XXXX was struggling to process my credit card and requested to run it multiple times. My stepson stayed in the store, while I walked out to take a call. My stepson then followed me with his parts and was not given a receipt. The store owner then closed the doors giving me no access to go back in for a receipt. Before leaving the parking lot I called Barclays to confirm the charges, since she ran my card multiple times. I spoke with a customer service representative that confirmed there was only one charge for {$64.00}.

A few days later I went to the grocery store and attempted to use my card but was declined. I then called customer service and I was told that my card had a lock due to potential fraud. I called customer service when I got home and was told that my card was locked due to a {$660.00} charge from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I explained to the representative that the charge was incorrect and shared what happened with the store. I immediately called the store, and the manager did not answer. I then began a text conversation with her where she acknowledged she had made a mistake. See attached text message print. 
Ive had multiple conversations with your customer service department about this incident. I called in to the concierge service and spoke with a representative who identified herself as a manager, and she advised me that this would be resolved, and I would not have to worry about this. She suggested that I call back after XX/XX/XXXX because my account would be credited by then. 
I subsequently learned that Barclays had sent letters to my old address with a determination that my request to credit the {$600.00} charge was denied due to not having a receipt. When I did receive this letter, I called Barclays on XX/XX/2023, and the customer service rep explained that there had been a decision made and to resend the text messages and to request the dispute be reopened. I immediately faxed a request to reopen my dispute and sent copies of my text conversation with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX where she admits the processing error and stated she would credit the account. 
Its now XX/XX/XXXX and there has been no resolution. Ive driven to the skate shop multiple times and the store is always closed. Ive also called the owner multiple times with no response. I do not believe that my dispute has been handled by Barclays with appropriate consideration. I do not understand why my card was flagged by Barclays for fraud, and I am appalled by the misrepresentation of your concierge service representatives. Satisfactory resolution would have been to reverse the {$600.00} overcharge. 
I've submitted a letter to Barclays sent to Barclays Card Services XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, DE XXXX with this description and a complaint to the FDIC. 

Thank you for your attention. Your assistance with this matter is appreciated. See attached text correspondence with Retailer Manager/Owner where she acknowledges the overcharge and states she will credit the account, but clearly lied and upon further research in the community I was told by other consumers that they have experienced same issues and have a history of fraudulent activity.

2023-11-22,"Credit card","Store credit card","Getting a credit card","Card opened without my consent or knowledge","I am writing to formally submit a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regarding a distressing situation involving Barclays Bank and their handling of an unauthorized Banana Republic Rewards Credit Card that was opened in my name. The details of the incident are as follows : On XX/XX/2023, I received an unexpected call from Barclays Bank concerning overdue payments on an existing Banana Republic Rewards Credit Card. To my shock, I had no prior knowledge of the existence of this credit card. It came to my attention that this credit card had been apparently opened in connection with an account at Barclays Bank shortly after I made a purchase at a Banana Republic store a few weeks earlier. 

I was deeply alarmed by this fraudulent situation, which involved the unauthorized use of my personal information. As an individual from another country, I am not familiar with the nuances of consumer credit information manipulation in the United States, particularly when it involves store employees collecting personal information under the guise of enrolling customers in rewards programs and subsequently using that information to surreptitiously open credit card accounts without explicit consent. 

Upon receiving the call from Barclays, I promptly informed their agent that I had not applied for any credit card, had never received XXXX, and had never applied for a bank account with Barclays. I requested that they immediately close any account associated with my name. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I visited XXXXXXXX XXXX with my husband to open a joint account and was astounded to discover that I had two late payments negatively impacting my credit score. These late payments were linked to the unauthorized Banana Republic Rewards Credit Card account at Barclays, which was having significant repercussions on my creditworthiness. 

I immediately contacted Barclays once again to report this situation and reiterated that I had not authorized the credit card, that I had already requested the closure of the account and expressed my concerns about the impact on my credit score. Barclays informed me that they would initiate an investigation into the matter and assured me that I would receive a written response within 30 days regarding the status of the investigation. 

Regrettably, as of the time of this complaint, I have not received any such letter or communication from Barclays regarding the investigation. Furthermore, the investigation remains unresolved, and despite my weekly follow-up calls, Barclays continues to inform me that it may take up to 90 days to receive a response. 

This ongoing situation has caused me considerable distress and uncertainty about my financial well-being. I am deeply worried about the potential long-term consequences of this unauthorized credit card account on my credit score and overall financial stability.

I kindly request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's assistance in addressing this matter and ensuring that Barclays Bank takes immediate action to investigate and resolve this fraudulent activity. I am uncertain about the appropriate steps to take to safeguard my financial interests, and your intervention would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of this issue.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","CA","94109","","Consent provided","Web",2023-11-22,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7892437,2023

The Old Navy representative at the store said she could not assist me with anything regarding a credit card account and I would need to talk with Barclays ( the company I NEVER signed up with or authorized to have my account information ). I contacted Barclays several times and they said I would need to establish an online account for them to get access to my information. Upon establishing an online account, they locked me out of it. I ended up receiving a physical bill in the mail for something I did not recognize in the amount of {$180.00}. I decided to try and pay it just to ensure I don't have any issues with Barclays trying to discriminate against me and negatively marking my credit. The online system would not accept payment, when I called in the automated system demanded all my personal information and would not provide me with any of my account information but instead, transferred me to a live person in another country who prompted me to share all my personal information with her/him. 

After being locked out, of the online account I tried logging into, I contacted Barclays AGAIN, spending over a hour on the phone and I RECORDED THE FULL CONVERSATIONS, but did not get any help from them to resolve the issue in accessing my account. If I did not provide my mother 's maiden name or my physical address, they would not assist me. I was transferred to 3 different Barclay representatives in the XXXX and then to a 4th representative in XXXX. I was asked invasive questions which area a threat to my privacy and security such as my social security number, my address, my DOB, my mother 's maiden name, the full credit card number, my phone number and the 3 digit code on the back of my card. 

I had to pay for certifed mail to ensure a payment was processed because it is clear that Barclays is adding erroneous charges to an unauthorized account and then trying to keep consumers from paying the amount so they can collect late fees. Barclays is a scam and Old Navy is just as bad. I would not recommend that Old Navy or any of the other stores utilize Barclays for their customers. Further, I do not respect the encouragement of new credit accounts being opened by store representatives who will not be able to serve the customer in paying a bill or answering questions on the very account they establish. All the personal information being collecte and transacted across different software and viewed by different representatives in various countries is rediculous.

I have reason to believe that I am being extorted by your company, which is a serious violation of my right to privacy. As you may be aware, Congress has mandated that all financial institutions have an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of their customers and protect the security and confidentiality of their nonpublic personal information. The addition of these fraudulent late payments to my credit report has caused substantial harm and inconvenience to my financial reputation due to fraud, which undermines public confidence in the banking system. According to 15 U.S. Code 1666b ( a ), a creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open-end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose. Additionally, I should have received a negative information notice no later than 15 days after the alleged debt was validated with me as the consumer. If your company can not provide proof that they lawfully validated this alleged debt with me before furnishing it on my consumer report, then it is my belief that this has been a fraudulently furnished late payment with forethought and malice intended to cause me harm. Please be advised that under 15 U.S. Code 6821, any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation to a customer of a financial institution is a violation of federal law and will be held liable under 15 U.S. Code 6823 ( a ), with fines up to {$500000.00} for a felony by an organization, imprisonment for five years, or both pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 6823 ( a ). I demand that these late payments be updated to PAID AS AGREED and that each late payment be deleted from my credit report immediately to prevent further harm to my financial reputation. I will consider any non-reasonable response as frivolous and will file a fault judgment in the favor of the interest of me, the consumer, the holder in due course, the attorney, and the administrator in fact. I am giving you 15 days from the date of delivery to respond to this notice. Failure to disclose requested documents SUCH AS all documents, papers, correspondence, books of account, and financial and corporate records. or provide a response to rectify any faults by Barclays will serve as acquiescence and your agreement to a default judgment against your company for the dishonor in the negotiable instrument, bank fraud, creation of the false and deceptive form, mishandling of goods, compromising my relationship with other financial institutions, and including stress caused to me in the attempt of exercising my rights in good faith.

I am writing to file a formal complaint against Barclay for their refusal to grant me online access to my account and their lack of responsiveness in allowing me to speak with a manager in a timely manner. Additionally, I am facing difficulties in making bill payments, with no available resolution to remove negative marks from my credit report. 

I have been a customer of Barclay for 3 years apparently. However, despite numerous attempts to gain online access to my account, I have been repeatedly denied without any valid explanation. The lack of online access severely limits my ability to manage my account effectively and stay updated on my financial obligations. 

Furthermore, when I have attempted to speak with a manager to address these concerns, I have faced significant delays and obstacles. Customer service representatives have been unhelpful, unable to provide appropriate solutions, and have not escalated my concerns to the appropriate level. 

Another issue I am facing is the absence of a clear resolution for paying my bills and resolving any outstanding debts. I am willing to fulfill my financial obligations, but I have not been offered any viable options to pay off my debt and have it removed from my credit report. 

I kindly request the following actions : 1. Investigation : I request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau conducts a thorough investigation into Barclay 's practices regarding the denial of online access, lack of responsiveness, and failure to provide appropriate payment resolutions. 

2. Remedial Actions : I ask that appropriate actions be taken to ensure Barclay provides me with online access to my account, facilitates timely communication with a manager, and offers a feasible resolution to pay off my debt with the removal of negative marks from my credit report. 

3. Enforcement : If any violations or non-compliance with relevant consumer protection laws and regulations are found during the investigation, I urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to take appropriate enforcement actions to hold Barclay accountable. 

I have attached relevant documentation, including correspondence with Barclay, to support my complaint. Please find them enclosed for your reference.

Now, all these years later, that BarClays Card is damaging my credit report because XXXX and other companies are treating it as if it is a very old card that I took out or signed for many years ago. 

Months ago, I called BarClays to express my frustration about this situation. They claimed that they removed me as an Authorized User from the Card and yet, three months later, my Credit Score is still being dragged down by their BarClays Card. Again, I do not have any access to this card, I never accrued any debts on it, and my name should have no association with it whatsoever. Since I was delisted as an authorized user, I have noticed that they no longer list my mom 's debt as being my own, but I would like my association with the card to be removed completely.

I am a XXXX plus year XXXX in the credit and banking industry. I have carried a credit score of over 700 until relatively recently. My credit score has plummeted to less than 600 even though I pay my bills. Over a 30 or so year credit reporting history, I have been 90 days on XXXX accounts XXXX  years ago, and I have had maybe 4, 30 days over the past 2 years or so. 
The issue I have is that, even though i am paying, the credit card companies have lowered my limits. This in turn increases my utilization which in turn lowers my credit score. When one company does it, the others follow by lowering my limits to the balance owed. By doing so, the credit card companies are able to charge me the highest rates allowed by law while simultaneously limiting me in obtaining a consolidation loan or a credit card with a high enough limit to pay off others. 
Because of a recent divorce, XXXX sons in college, and my work in the turbulent mortgage industry, I have used my cards more over the past 3 years, I carry about XXXX in credit card debt, more than I would like but manageable. I had hoped to get these consolidated but because my score is so low, I can not. In addition, when I review my score, the advice I get is to """" open another credit card '' This will decrease your utilization rate. that's bad advice! 
I have talked with several friends and colleagues about this, and the vast majority are experiencing the same thing. 
Right now, I am trapped, with NO way out. Credit cards are necessary today and can be crucial in tough times. 
This seems to be a concerted effort to keep the consumer paying the highest rates possible while locking them into keeping the cards because there is no viable option to pay them off. 
I would ask you to look into the practices of credit card companies to see this and to determine what should be fixed. If not corrected, many consumers will simply give up and stop paying and what are the credit card companies going to do? ruin their credit scores, too late they are already so low it doesn't make a difference. Thus, there will be a huge write-off in the future.

Balance Transfer Fee {$220.00} ( Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX  ) 4. Balance Transfer Fee {$220.00} ( Thursday, XX/XX/ ) I immediately called to report the fraud. They assured me it would come off my account and they would investigate. The fraud did not come off the card... I had to keep calling. The 3rd or 4th time I called ( but this time with some assertion ) they finally removed the charges and apologized for their new system that was having problems and the complaint didn't go through. I asked if they could provide me with a name or any information of who this transfer went through to. They could provide me with nothing and said their fraud department would handle it. 

To note : I never received any emails about a balance transfer. I never received any physical mail about any balance transfers. I've done balance transfers in the past and I always receive some information. These charges just randomly appeared on my account out of nowhere and there is no documentation to be found about it. 

Fast forward to today ( XXXX  ) : I got a letter that concluded that """" the activity was valid based on my credit report where the balance transfer was sent. '' So, they reinstated the giant balance and transfer fees. 

I called today as well ( XX/XX/XXXX  ) : I stated my issues with these findings and demanded more information. I demanded they let me know the name of the person who received my money. They could not provide that ... All they can provide is the last 4 digits of the credit card to whom received my money via balance transfer. The card digits do not match any of my cards or my wife 's. I even went into my credit report to make sure my identity wasn't stolen, and someone didn't open a card in my name with those last 4 digits. 

There was almost no information they could provide me with.

The first notification of late payment was from my personal bank credit score monitoring program advising that my credit score had been reduced from XXXX to XXXX. 

After seeing that Barclays had filed the negative item on my credit report, I tried to access my online account. I could not remember my password and I tried to restore access via automated methods. When this did not work, I contacted Barclays customer service who first advised I did not have an online account, but later found that Barclays had a """" do not contact '' feature enabled on the account. Barclay 's customer service had to restore access to my account and waived the late payment fee. Once access was restored, I immediately made the payment. Shortly, thereafter, I received a letter advising contact had been restored on my account.

I do not dispute the amount owed, but I dispute Barclay 's making no effort to send me a printed statement or reminder via text, email, or other method before negatively impacting my credit score for something that could have been resolved in minutes, which could negatively impact my score for years.

I filed a dispute with each of the credit bureaus, with Barclays FCRA Credit Disputes Department, and wrote of my dissatisfaction with Barclays business practices to Gap Inc Customer Relations. 

Each of the bureaus advised that I should resolve with Barclays. Barclays advised that because the amount was past due, they would not be removing the negative reporting from my credit report.

Here is a summary of what happened : On XX/XX/ 2023, I received an e-receipt stating that my Banana Republic Barclays credit card was used for a transaction of {$710.00} in the state of Florida. However, I have never been to that state, and I can provide phone records to prove that I was at work in my own state at the time. Immediately after discovering this fraudulent activity, I contacted Barclays to report the identity theft. 

The following day, I received a credit alert notifying me that a Barclays XXXX XXXX credit card had been opened in my name. I promptly contacted Barclays again, filed a case with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), locked my credit file, and disputed all the charges. I was informed that the cases were under investigation. However, Barclays has failed to conduct a thorough investigation and has been unhelpful in resolving the issue. Their customer service representatives have been uncooperative and have provided vague responses. 

Whenever I report fraudulent activity, Barclays automatically issues new cards. However, even before I receive these new cards, I receive alerts that the cards have been used again. I have spent countless hours on the phone with Barclays, but they have not reached a resolution. To make matters worse, on XX/XX/XXXX, Barclays allowed a card that I had reported as fraud and was under investigation to be used, resulting in a loss of {$510.00}. These illegal activities seem to be specific to Barclays, leading me to suspect that an employee may be involved. 

Barclays informed me that the only mechanism they have in place is for me to report fraud when it occurs. Despite my requests, they refuse to refrain from issuing new cards under my name. I feel helpless as there seems to be no end in sight. Every morning, my first task is to check if any illegal activities have occurred in my Barclays accounts. I have provided Barclays with all the necessary documentation, including a police report, FTC report, and phone history to prove the origin of my calls and the steps I have taken to protect my credit since XX/XX/ 2023. However, Barclays has taken no responsibility for the situation and continues to claim that they can only act retroactively if someone opens an account in my name. 

Furthermore, the person responsible for this fraud also requested a credit increase on a card that I never requested. The situation seems to be never-ending, as another card was used in my name just yesterday, once again from Barclays. I am in desperate need of assistance to resolve this matter.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","NC","282XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-19,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8018352,2023

Your dispute department first attempted to convince me that I should not bother disputing these charges with you, but instead should work on my own to address these unauthorized transactions with XXXX because the dispute process takes months. I insisted on disputing the charges with your team, after which the group reluctantly took a record of these disputes. 

Now I have received a letter stating that you require additional information, and when I called the number listed in your letter to provide it, the representative informed me that my claim is closed because I was not able to pick up two telephone calls from unknown numbers on XX/XX/23 and XX/XX/23. She stated that the only way my claim will be reopened is if I send a signed and dated letter stating that I did not receive any merchandise in connection with these transactions. She would not accept my personal statement to that effect. 

Let it be known : I did not receive any merchandise in connection with the above-referenced transactions, as I stated ( in a recorded call ) the very first time I filed these disputes. 

You can confirm the validity of this representation by the documentation Target provided to you in connection with the dispute, which clearly shows that this merchandise was ordered ( using my credit card ) by XXXX XXXX, of XXXX, who resides at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NC XXXX. Again, you can find this information in your own records for the dispute I filed, as you have now mailed me copies of these same records clearly substantiating that I did not order nor receive these goods. 

Based on my experience with this claim, I must conclude that Barclays desires to dissuade cardholders from proceeding with even valid charge disputes, as this is by far the most difficult time I have ever had disputing a charge. Moreover, for you to hold records in your possession demonstrating that the charge is fraudulent and still refusing to refund the money unless I jump through various hoops mandates a careful review of your processes to avoid consumer abuse.

2023-02-10,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem when making payments","Problem during payment process","I have two credit card accounts. I have had them for several years and represent in total a credit line of {$30000.00}. I have used their auto bill pay services for these accounts. 

As of XX/XX/2022, Barclays issued a automatic payment on one account of more than {$8000.00}. The normal reoccurring payments for this account were just a few hundred dollars. I contacted Barclays immediately by phone ( within 24 hours ) before the payment was processed ; I receive notifications in advance by email. They would not correct their error and reverse the payment. 

I contacted my bank before they had processed the payment to have return the remittance advice. Allowing the payment to process would have started a waterfall of overdrafts and fees. The said they had to allow the payment to process but would reverse it expeditiously. Which the did. 

Barclays subsequently canceled my autopay on all accounts; including the unaffected credit account. I discovered this in XXXX when my supposedly auto payment was processed. I incurred a late fee and a negative credit report. 

I then contacted them several times ( seven ) by phone. They acknowledged the problem. I attempted to make significant payments {$10000.00} total but Barclays had blocked my bank account and could not find a way to unblock ( supposedly ). The payment on my other account came due and it went past due. This was three weeks after I contacted before several times. 

As of now I have two credit lines on which I am being charged very high interest but Barclays wont accept my payments any longer. I have spent hours on the phone and several cases have been created but the management seems too busy to address on my numerous phone calls ( all incurring roaming charges for being out of country ). 

The duration from the point of their initial failure to currently is two months. I have elected to make payments from restricted accounts of which incur fees. 

I have no confidence Barclays will resolve. The are off the charts in terms of being difficult to business with and their lack of management is costing me significant time and money. I have taken the steps to redirect my business elsewhere because I am lucky enough to be able to. I feel sorry for others less fortunate and have to deal with the systemic management disinterest and XXXX  fees.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","WA","980XX","Older American, Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2023-02-10,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6556312,2023

Please read the explanation below carefully before closing the case as was done previously!!! 
Thanks. 



I will briefly describe what is happening with my credit card account. 

On XX/XX/2023, I received a correspondence from Barclays offering balance transfer checks My balance on that date was {$0.00}, that is, I owed nothing to Barclays and therefore had an available credit of {$6200.00}. 
I then used check number XXXX and filled in the amount of {$5000.00} to use to pay for other credit cards. This check was written in the name of XXXX XXXX, my husband, and deposited into his XXXX XXXX account on XX/XX/2023. 
On XX/XX/2023, my husband received a letter from XXXX XXXX, informing him that the Barclays check had returned due to insufficient funds. 
I called Barclays and explained what had happened and an attendant informed me that he would check what was happening, as my debt was {$5200.00} : {$5000.00} balance transfer, {$250.00} fees and {$26.00} returned check fee. 
After a few more days, I received a statement from Barclays confirming these values. 
I contacted Barclays again and the staff were unable to tell me what was happening. 
Several explanations were given and no solution was taken. 
I made more than XXXX calls to Barclays, spending more than XXXX hours in total with no solution. 
I have marked the names of the attendants, time and date of several calls and also recorded the audios. 
On XX/XX/2023, I had to pay the minimum amount of {$52.00} from my account to avoid damaging my credit without any solution to the problem. 
I did not use the amount of {$5000.00} because the check was not paid due to insufficient funds and I had a debt of {$5200.00} with Barclays that does not exist. 
Until today, I haven't found any solution. 
I have already received several promises from service managers about solving my problem, but I realize that in addition to the lack of instruction and knowledge of these agents, there is a great lack of desire to solve the problem. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, that is, 2 months after the problem started, a service manager promised me that the case would be resolved by XX/XX/XXXX, but nothing was resolved. Again I had to pay the amount of {$52.00} to keep my account in good standing. 
It is very clear that the attendants are instructed to be elegant with customers but do not have the ability or desire to actually resolve the problem. 
I come to the conclusion that Barclays is stealing from me the amount of {$5200.00} and the attendants are complicit in this theft. 
I already sent a letter to Barclays on XX/XX/XXXX with a copy of all the documents proving Barclays ' error, but to my disappointment, I received a response letter from Barclays on XX/XX/XXXX saying : We are currently unable to complete your request. 
I can not find any other channel of communication with Barclays to resolve this problem, so I will hire a lawyer and assert my right to expose the fraud committed by Barclays to the media to show Barclays ' lack of interest in resolving the problem. 
I will spare no effort to use legal means to prove that Barclays is committing fraud against me. 
If necessary and at an opportune time, I will be able to present documents again that prove all of the above. 
I remain at your disposal for further details.

I paid additional months thinking the final payment would go through and be cleared. In XX/XX/2023 I contacted Barclay 's and disputed the charge.

I just finished talking to them again. I paid the amount in order to clear my credit. They were sympathetic but not helpful.

When I called Barclays to pay this overdue XXXX dollars in XXXX, I was told when I called in XXXX that I did not owe XXXX Dollars and that my previous payment made the account current. Thus how can I be marked 30 days late on something I have tried multiple times to pay and resolve? Barclays insists on running my credit over XXXX dollars because they will not admit they made a mistake. Why would someone who has made every payment on time suddenly miss one month 's pay for {$37.00}? 
Furthermore, Barclays removed the 30-day late reporting when the first dispute was filed, suddenly changed it to 60 days, and then back to 30 days. I am so baffled ; I need someone to accept my {$37.00} or take this 30 days late off my report. You can not refuse to take my money and report me 30 days late ; this is not fraud or retaliation because of being disputed. Furthermore, I consider it harassment and discriminatory treatment. Why would you do something to affect someone's credit for seven years by marking a payment 30 days past due over {$37.00}? Furthermore, the late amount never showed on any statement and did not reflect an overdue amount. 
When I called in XXXX to pay over the phone, I instructed the representative to pay the amount to create the account current TO AVOID 30 DAYS LATE. The representative stated that the amount due was approximately {$110.00}. I spent this and thought the report had been made 30 DAYS PAST DUE. I'm XXXX XXXX XXXX and a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  ; why would you insist on damaging a young adult 's credit for seven years until they are XXXX XXXX XXXX, all for XXXX dollars?

Or please tell me why you feel it necessary to ruin a XXXX military dependent and XXXX XXXX who is a XXXX XXXX XXXX  and worked many hours in XXXX on COVID units putting my own life at risk for the service of others. Now you want to ruin my credit over {$37.00} ; why? Perhaps this was a simple miscommunication, or the information was misunderstood. It happens, so let 's fix the issue and move along, please fix the problem, and I will be happy to pay the amount of the card off and close the account, and never do business with Barclays again. Or please provide me a reason as to why you are insistent on reporting {$37.00} overdue.

At the time I had spoken with the merchant, who agreed with my complaint and said they would not contest the dispute. After a month, I received letters from Barclays saying they would not send the dispute to the merchant, first because I needed to try and return the """" merchandise '' and second because services were provided. I requested multiple times to speak with a supervisor, and was told none were available. I finally filed a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX which got a response from the """" Office of the President ''.

I have called Barclays multiple times inquiring as to why the dispute has not been finalized in my favor, given the merchant 's response. Each time, Barclays says they are still investigating, and can not give me a timeframe as to when my dispute will be finished. Multiple times, I have requested to speak with a supervisor in the dispute department, to be told there are none available and that they will call me back within XXXX hours.

When I called XXXX, they said they had no knowledge of that charge and that they did not receive any payment from me for that amount. I challenged the charge with my Barclay 's Bank Banana Republic Mastercard, and received a temporary credit while they investigated. 

They refused on multiple occasions to call XXXX, and said I would have to call them, receive a notice of some kind, and then fax it to them. They then sent me to another department, twice, and told me I could call XXXX with that department. Well the other department told me I needed to work exclusively with the fraud department, after two 30+ minute phone calls on two separate occasions. Barclay 's should have all of these phone calls recorded. 

I was recharged that {$100.00} on XX/XX/, with a letter from the credit card company informing me that, due to my continued history with the vendor, I was responsible for the amount. I was charged another {$86.00} from XXXX on XX/XX/, but like before, I did not approve of this purchase and I am the only person with access to my card. They had to replace my card for a second time, and it remains locked while I try to figure out how my card information was compromised on XXXX 's website. I was told by an agent at Barclay 's that they would not submit my request unless I provided proof from XXXX that I did not make the purchases. 
I faxed the appropriate paperwork, petition, and purchase receipts to Barclay 's. I received a letter yesterday, XX/XX/2023, that the investigation team found that I am not responsible for the {$86.00} purchase. I called today, XX/XX/2023, and the fraud investigation department told me that they just re-opened my request for the {$100.00} investigation on XX/XX/2023. They will not send me any confirmation information, or otherwise inform me of the investigation process until they approve or deny it. They keep denying this claim, despite the evidence and continued confirmation from XXXX that I did not make these purchases. 

I have been calling and having meaningless conversations with this department for over two months ; they will not refund me, process the proof I have submitted, or even submit my petition to the appropriate parties from what I have been told. I am convinced they are denying this claim continuously, and I have acted in good faith for over two months to try and fix this issue with the credit card company. 

When I asked who to send an advocate to speak to, the latest agent told me she didn't know what an advocate was, but that I would need to have my lawyer call them directly.

All of the current charges that are left on my account are fraud. I filed complaints with CFPB and the XXXX  because its clear that the evidence of fraud that I have provided is not being taken in account. Each time Ive provided NEW information and proof. Each Barclays response states there was no new information provided which is not true. I have received at least four different reasons from Barclays stating why the charges are NOT fraudulent ; however, there is no basis for any of them. 
I was home in XXXX XXXX. The only valid charge on XX/XX/XXXX was at XXXX XXXX. Please see attached documents that prove when my mom returned to XXXX and that I was in XXXX when the charges in questions were made. 
The first reason Barclays fraud team gave for saying the charges were not fraudulent was that I was notified of these when they were being made. That is NOT true. I was not notified that any charges were being made on my card in XXXX. I did not realize these XXXX charges were made and that my card was lost on XX/XX/XXXX until I received a payment late notice from Barclays. The second reason I was given the reason that the card was in my possession so the charges were not fraud. No my card was lost in New York. 
I ALWAYS pay my credit card balances off every month and have always had an excellent credit rating. I have not charged anything on this card since XX/XX/XXXX because I didnt have it. 
Please understand that I allowed my mother to use my card when she was in XXXX. Barclays third reason they said this was not fraud because I had authorized my mom to use my card. That makes absolutely no sense because she flew home from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Each time I've appealed I'm given a different reason why the charges are not fraud. 
The documentation I've provided has NEVER been acknowledged. I can provide additional documentation if needed that proves we were in XXXX when the fraudulent charges were made. 
Barclays continues to charge interest & late fees on these fraudulent charges and ruin my credit score. This is truly a travesty.

The floor manger took both our licenses and told us she would try to get us approved for for financing and left us in the lobby. She came back and told us, that my husband was approved for {$10000.00} and I was approved for {$6000.00}. We never applied for the credit cards, it was all done by someone there. We were in another room and had no input. I was not informed of the credit terms and did not know they had applied for credit with XXXX and affiliate of XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX lines is one of the stakeholders being sold in the package they offered us. At the end of the presentation when they ushered us into a room to sign a stack of 55 pages. During this time the closing agent XXXX XXXX was talking up the company and talking a mile a minute distracting us. However both my husband and I repeatedly asked him if we could cancel at any time, and we were assured that yes we could. We were given this assurance by the sales agent XXXX, the floor supervisor, and the closing agent. I wanted time to review the documents. All these people lied to us. 

When I tried to cancel 2 weeks later I was told that I could cancel the contract but would be held liable for the credit card expense. When I spoke with the credit card company that told me that if we did not pay our credit would be ruined. We began making payments while trying to get the contract cancelled. We had an attorney send a letter out to XXXX XXXX and they did not respond to us. I called and wrote to the director and a gentleman by the name of XXXX XXXX with no clear response. 

When COVID -19 impacted the world the credit card company raised the monthly payments. We could no longer make the payments for a product we did not receive. In reading the documents later I found out if I miss a payment for renewal, they have the right to void the membership. Even though XXXX XXXX collected {$160000.00}.

COMPLAINT regarding DISPUTE Case Numbers : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Dear Sir or Madam COMPLAINT I am writing to advise you that I am unhappy with the decision taken not to refund payments as requested in my prior letters dated XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX which are enclosed. 
I booked my travel with a XXXX XXXX based company called XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX number XXXX XXXX  : XXXX. This company entered insolvency on XX/XX/XXXX. This has left many people, I included, out of pocket for future travel with them in XXXXThis initial tour was to take place on XX/XX/XXXX and was postponed as a result of Covid and the closure of International borders. Frankly, it was illegal to travel for tourism until XXXX did not fully recover after Covid, but prior to this it was an award winning and highly reputable company. 
It was impossible for me to know that they would not follow through on the purchased travel commitment. I asked for a reimbursement but they refused citing they would honor future tours. I rebooked on XX/XX/XXXX for a XX/XX/XXXX Tour. XX/XX/XXXX ( three months later ) they placed my re-booked XXXX Tour on hold. Shortly after, XXXX sent a letter they were beginning closure of XXXX. Communication went silent after they placed my re-book XX/XX/XXXX on Hold and then they went bankrupt. This card and those transactions were purchased with intention towards travel, and no travel happened. 
I appreciate that there are time-scales for refunds to be initiated, but I had no reason to believe up until XX/XX/XXXX that my tour would not be honored. I am part of an 800- strong group of failed customers who are working with a money advisor so I am aware that many financial companies including XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX have already made refund payments to XXXX  customers. 
These payments were made in good faith by me and I trusted in the fact that I used your companys card for a future travel event that I was covered in case of failure. Most importantly, I can prove the monthly payments from your monthly statements and these were not ever used for this promised tour. 
On a personal level and due to their insolvency, I would find this refusal to refund my money devastating. I placed my trust in your financial institution and was certain you had measures in place to protect me as a valued customer in a case like this. I would be grateful if you could reconsider the position regarding my request and return funds to my account using the Chargeback mechanism. A {$250.00} voucher for XXXX  tour and 9 proven monthly payments {$160.00} each. This total is {$1900.00} US Dollars. ( Particulars of Claim ) Priceline Barclays card is ironically touted as a Travel card, which makes this request even more profound and involving XXXX  Travel Tour business failure and subsequent bankruptcy. 
If you feel unable to do this please issue a written full and final response letter. I will then bring this forward to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Specifically, after settling my account, Barclays Bank levied a minimal charge of {$0.00} and {$0.00} as a """" minimum charge fee.

These companies have failed in their duty to investigate disputed information. I have reached out to these reporting companies several times, yet they continue to report errors on my credit report, knowingly providing false information. 

The information on my credit report is outdated and inaccurate. I do not currently owe any money to Barclays Bank Delaware, nor do I have an active account with them. 

XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX are each reporting the following errors and violations : Error : Date of Last Activity : Discrepancy across all three credit reporting companies. 
FCRA Violation : 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 - Duty to Provide Accurate Information Requested Action : Correct the inconsistencies in the Date of Last Activity. 

Error : Payment Status reported as """" Collection/Chargeoff '' despite being marked as Paid.

FCRA Violation : 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 - Duty to Provide Accurate Information Requested Action : Clarify the payment status accurately. Per IRS a charge account is Ordinary Income and Ordinary Income should not be reported on a consumer report.

An account can not both be a collections and a chargeoff at the same time. 

Error : XXXX consistently reports this account as a Chargeoff every month. 
FCRA Violation : 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 - Duty to Provide Accurate Information A charge off only takes place one time this can not report every month as a charge off each month. This is hurting my credit.

Error : Comments on account : """" Account information disputed by consumer, meets FCRA requirements. '' This comment is misleading and false, as this account reporting does not meet FCRA requirements.

FCRA Violation : 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 - Duty to Provide Accurate Information Error : High Credit amounts differ across all three companies.

FCRA Violation : 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 - Duty to Provide Accurate Information I kindly request that Barclays Bank Delaware undertake the following actions : Correct the inaccuracies on my credit reports with XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX to ensure that the information is accurate, complete, and verifiable. 

Provide written confirmation of the corrections made to my credit reports and delete the account due to multiple violations. 

I am seeking a remuneration of {$1000.00} per violation of the FCRA, totaling {$5000.00}, to address the harm caused by these inaccuracies. This payment should be mailed to the following address within 30 days or I will take further legal action.

The payment was sent via XXXX and the check was written by XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX. The payment was supposed to be applied to the balance on our Navyist Rewards XXXX XXXX account. The address and name associated with our Barclays account was listed on the check from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

According to Barclays Bank, the {$8000.00} check cashed on XX/XX/2023 and posted to their general ledger as a """" non-conforming payment '' since no payment slip was enclosed with the check. 

Barclays provides the following information for """" non-conforming payments '' on the back of their statements : Mailed Payments : A conforming payment received by us by XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX will be credited to your account the day of receipt. A conforming payment is a payment that : XXXX ) is mailed with the payment coupon included with this statement or printed from oldnavy.barclaysus.com to Barclays, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX ; and XXXX ) is in the form of a single, non-folded check or money order made payable in U.S. dollars from a U.S. based institution. Any payment that does not meet these requirements, or any payment with multiple checks or money orders, additional correspondence, staples, paperclips, etc. will be considered a non-conforming payment, which may delay the crediting of the payment for up to 5 days. 

On XX/XX/2023 the {$8000.00} payment had not posted to my Barclays Navyist Rewards World Mastercard account On XX/XX/2023 I contacted Barclays via online chat to inquire about the payment. I have copies of all online chats to prove the exact nature of the conversation. I told the customer service rep the issue and provided the dollar amount of the payment and that it was coming from XXXX Bank. The customer service rep requested the check number and bank routing and account number in order to open an investigation. I informed the customer service rep that I did not have access to that information since the payment was sent by XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX via XXXX and not directly from XXXX Bank. 

On XX/XX/2023, I contacted Barclays via online chat to inquire about the payment. I told the customer service rep the issue and provided the check number from the payment that was cashed by Barclays on XX/XX/XXXX. The check number was sufficient proof of payment information for Barclays to locate the payment on their general ledger and make it a """" conforming payment ''. Barclays provided a case number and said it will take 30-60 days for the investigations team to respond. The customer service rep stated that all fees and interest will be waved until the payment is found. I provided XXXX phone numbers to contact me back at with any updates. 

On XX/XX/XXXX a provisional credit for {$8000.00} was applied to my Barclays Navyist Rewards World Mastercard account On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Barclays stating that the proof of payment needs to be sent via fax to XXXX or the provisional payment would be removed. Examples of proof of payment : front and back copy of cashed check, Money order receipt, Electronic Funds Transfer. 

On XX/XX/2023 XXXX XXXX  faxed a Declaration of Payment with a copy of the original check front and back and the XXXX Case ID to Barclays fax number XXXX and mailed a physical copy to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX DE XXXX. 

On XX/XX/2023, I contacted Barclays via online chat to inquire if they received the declaration of payment. The customer service rep stated that a case had been opened with the investigations team but it will take another 30-60 days for a response and they could not confirm if the investigations team had received the declaration of payment. The customer service rep stated they will add notes for the investigations team that XXXX XXXX had faxed the declaration of payment. I requested contact information for the investigations team and they were not able to provide it. The customer service rep stated the investigations team will send a letter when the payment is found. 

On XX/XX/2023 I received a letter from Barclays Bank stating that they had not received proof of payment and the provisional credit was removed from my account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I filed a complaint with the CFPB ( ID XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX the CFBP complaint was closed by Barclays with an explanation. The explanation was that the investigations team completed their investigation and was not able to locate the payment. Barclays Office of the President representative requested proof of payment be faxed to XXXX in order to continue the investigation. 

This explanation was also provided in a XX/XX/XXXX letter from the Barclays Office of the President representative. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a voicemail from Barclays Office of the President representative requesting a callback I spoke to Barclays Office of the President representative several times over the following weeks regarding the missing payment. I told him that proof of payment was provided on XX/XX/XXXX. He denies that the proof of payment was received by Barclays at any time and requested proof of payment be emailed to him. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed XXXX the proof of payment that was originally sent by XXXX XXXX  via fax and USPS on XX/XX/XXXX. 

The Barclays Office of the President representative apparently located the payment and stated that the payment was sent back to XXXX by Barclays I have tried to contact XXXX and can not find anyone to help me with this matter. 

I have contacted XXXX XXXX  and they claim that Barclays still has the money The Barclays Office of the President representative stated that interest and fees that were previously promised to be waived would now be reinstated since I did not provide proof of payment in the required time frame The Barclays Office of the President representative has continually stated over the phone that Barclays does not have the {$8000.00} and there is nothing they can do to help. 

I requested to be contacted by a supervisor from Barclays Office of the President and a summary of their investigations findings to be provided to me in writing. 

A Barclays Office of the PresidenXXXX supervisor called me on XX/XX/XXXX stating they would look into the missing payment and if the fees and interest can be waived. 

I can not reach anyone in Barclays Office of the President as of XX/XX/XXXX to check the status of the missing payment It has been 75 days since Barclays cash the {$8000.00} check and posted it to their general ledger. 

Neither Barclays, XXXX, XXXX or XXXX XXXX are able to locate the {$8000.00} at this time. 

My Barclays account is passed due and I am getting several calls a day from their collections department. 

I have invested 10 + hours into figuring out where the {$8000.00} went and am hitting a dead end in every direction I turn.

From the very beginning, Barclays has clearly demonstrated an unwillingness to fairly adjudicate this matter. Despite touting their liability protection on purchases for business customers, Barclays continues to manufacture a variety of excuses to avoid dealing with this dispute claim. From account representatives in the dispute department, to agents assigned to investigate, to supervisors who can not be reached directly, to the Office of The President, there is no accountability at any level of the company. 

For some context, I am a long-time Barclays JetBlue cardholder . I have both business and personal cards. My entire family has Barclays credit cards. I am what is considered a """" high value client. '' Nonetheless, my dispute rights are being violated. 

In brief, the dispute is over a {$50000.00} deck that was supposed to built by a subcontractor I hired in XXXX of XXXX. I paid this subcontractor through XXXX, his preferred method of payment. I have used XXXX for over 5 years. Hundreds of transactions paid for goods and services, mostly done on a XXXX XXXX credit card. I have never had any problems. That includes several individual disputes also initiated on XX/XX/XXXX for the same subcontractor for the same job. All investigated and adjudicated by XXXX. ( attached ) No issues whatsoever. I used my Barclays business credit card for ONLY {$3000.00} of the $ XXXX in payments for this job. I paid the 3 % XXXX credit card fees to have the protection of my credit card company, in the event goods or services are not produced. 

As it were, the dispute centered around work that was paid for and never performed. I have ample documentation, which I have provided to investigators working on the XXXX disputes. However, just a few days after filing the dispute with Barclays, I received a denial letter dated XX/XX/XXXX ( attached ). An investigation was never opened. The verdict read : """" services were rendered... the merchant is due payment. '' Not exactly a thorough investigation. As this case was escalated, Barclays kept switching the excuse. The second reason, now presented to me as official letters from the Office of the President, ( attached ) asserts XXXX does not offer dispute rights on these transactions. That would mean XXXX has a different standard for Visa and MasterCard when it comes to disputing charges. XXXX categorically denies this. Given my experience with Visa disputes for the exact same merchant, exact same payment method for the exact same job, I also know this is completely false. The third excuse claims the method in which the XXXX payment was made violated XXXX terms and conditions and therefore is not disputable. I have spoken to XXXX at length. They deny each and every excuse presented by Barclays. The fourth excuse, and easily the most galling, is that the time to file a dispute has passed and now there is nothing they can do. 

What Barclays has effectively done here over the last 2+ months, is run legal interference for a subcontractor who willingly defrauded a """" valued cardholder. '' This case has been escalated as high as the Office of the President. It has not moved the needle at all. Only a frustrating barrage of false, insufficient responses, sparse communication and endless excuses.

I was told with a program they had, I would get all my money back in 20 years. I went to cancel it the next day and was told I was locked in due to authorizing them to take my other 2 timeshares. So instead, they lowered the points and cost to {$38000.00} but retained my large downpayment and would not refund. Upon returning home I found out they lied, and I was able to cancel and that no one owned my other timeshares except me, as they had NOT been transferred to them as stated. They only offered three days to cancel. I have been fighting since to get out of this contract and get my money back. 

I disputed the charges split between RCI Barclays Rewards MC {$6700.00} and XXXX XXXX {$9000.00} around XX/XX/XXXX. Both put a hold on the charges. I eventually sent paperwork and information on what transpired with this purchase. Within a month or so XXXX released me from any financial obligations. I received a notice about dispute ID : XXXX XXXX from Barclay XX/XX/XXXX that I had provided insufficient proof. I had made several calls prior to ask what they needed and received no input. I collected all the info I could and sent it to them, opening a new dispute ID : DBO XXXX shortly after the prior letter was received. 

During all of this I had been in contact multiple times with XXXX XXXX XXXX. Finally, after much push they released me from the contract because they knew their agent had lied to me. But they had me sign a paper on XX/XX/XXXX, that stated something about my having to deal with my financial obligations to the other entities that I had paid. I sent this release letter to Barclays. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter stating I had provided insufficient proof again to Barclay. I called and spoke with an agent at Barclays MC who said they could not help me any further. I was beyond devastated. This means I am free from the contract with XXXX XXXX but still owe {$6700.00} for NOTHING. I recently sent everything to the corporate offices of Barclay Bank with a letter addressing this signed XX/XX/XXXX. They have not received it yet. 

XXXX did the honorable thing. I am turning XXXX in a month. I can't afford to lose that money. I have a Developmental Delayed adult daughter I support who was coerced into also signing this contract with XXXX XXXX saying it was the only way she could go with her other sister if I became incapacitated or died.

In late XXXX XXXX, we found that my wife was pregnant. According to XXXX XXXX policy listed on their WEBSITE - XXXX XXXX XXXX  - XXXX  people can not board the ship afteXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( which my wife would be at the time of boarding the cruise ). According to the policy, you are to contact them and they will assist in resolving the situation. 

Based on this policy, I contacted XXXX XXXX to try to work with them on the situation. They wanted proof of the XXXX with letterhead from a physician THE SAME DAY ( at the time of calling, it was a Sunday, all medical offices are CLOSED ). I can provide all documentation but the lady at XXXX XXXX would not extend the dates, would not work with us on giving us time to gather the information required, and basically told us if we didnt provide it in their timeframe, we would lose over 50 % of our amount paid to XXXX XXXX which was like {$2300.00}, so we would end up losing {$900.00} + {$500.00} ( this math didnt make sense to me either but XXXX XXXX was such a hassle to deal with, I moved forward ). 

Since XXXX XXXX was no help, I asked them to cancel the cruise so that I could at least recover {$1800.00} of my purchase and not lose a substantial amount of money. 

The same day ( again, this was late XXXX XXXX ), I contacted Barclays and asked them for help with disputing the remaining {$500.00}. I provided all of the information, including what is listed above ( policies, situation, etc. ). I had to explain multiple times to the person at Barclays what the situation was, the policies, what was going on, etc. About 10 days ago, I get another phone call from Barclays stating that XXXX XXXX has disputed my {$500.00} dispute and if I had anything more to provide to Barclays... XXXX? I provided everything originally about the dispute to Barclays. I had to yet again explain to a new dispute agent about what is going on and the policy etc. 

I guess Barclays didn't do much or planned to do much with that information because literally a few days later, Barclays reversed my {$500.00} credit on my credit card, indicating that I lost the dispute. 

My issue is not so much that I lost the dispute, its that I fully expected a company I've been using their credit card for over 7 years to at least do their due diligence in giving me a fair chance at a dispute. The entire dispute process with Barclays seemed negligent : 1. I had to explain my issue to several people. Due to this, I don't think Barclays fully understood the situation despite several attempts at discussing it, therefore, I don't think I was given a fair chance at the dispute process. XXXX XXXX policy is clearly on their website. I made all attempts to resolve it and XXXX XXXX was not helpful. 
2. It seems I lost the dispute, NO INFORMATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED AS TO WHY OR THE OUTCOME, I can just see it on my statement clear as day. 

Either way, I don't expect anything to come out of this, I'm not even a customer anymore, after this- I closed all my Barclays cards. I refuse to give a company money that has this poor of customer service.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","NY","145XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-11-01,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7787888,2023

2023-06-04,"Credit card or prepaid card","Store credit card","Getting a credit card","Card opened as result of identity theft or fraud","To whom it might concern, The incident happened at XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/2023, at the XXXX Banana Republic ( owned by XXXX XXXX ) store. I was checking out, and the manager, whose name was XXXX, asked me if I wanted to join the membership so I could get a discount on my order. I said yes because I thought the discount was good for joining the membership. But I did not know that he was actually applying for a credit card on my behalf. He used the word """" store card '' and """" membership '' interchangeably and no ordinary reasonable person could have thought that it was actually a credit card I was applying for. More importantly, he never even mentioned the word """" credit card. '' I answered some questions, including my current address, my phone number, my annual income, and my social security number. The requirement of annual income and social security number were suspicious to me but it was never mentioned that I was actually applying for a credit card, neither orally by the manager nor in writing on the screen where I answered all the questions. 

When I was ready to swipe my own card to make the purchase, I was told that the items were already paid for. I got really confused and it was then did I realize that the manager applied for a credit on my behalf, and the items were paid by that new credit card. I immediately made the objection to him that I never agreed, neither orally nor in writing, to apply for a credit card. And he never explained to me that I was actually applying for a credit card. He just told me that he was sorry and that I could close the card on Monday. I made it clear to him that I never agreed to apply for a credit card, so there was never a contract for this credit card because of the lack of my consent. But the manager clearly does not have any clue on how a contract works, I see no point in talking to him further on this, so I told him that I did not want the items anymore, and he returned the items. 

I feel like I was defrauded by this manager and the Banana Republic to apply for a Banana Republic credit card without my consent, and this application history is going to negatively affect my credit report and my credit score in the future. 

For the record, to determine if there was a contract made for the credit card, the legal standard applicable here is whether an objective reasonable person would have thought that it was a credit card, not a membership, that he is applying for under similar circumstances. The answer is clearly NO. The manager did not, orally or in writing let me know that I was applying for a credit card, and I did not orally or in writing consent to the application of a credit card. So no objective reasonable person would have thought that he was applying for a credit card, therefore there is never a contract. 

I know about the legal standard because I am a XXXX XXXX who goes to an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I have an even better understanding of how a contract works and how credit card applications work because XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. And if I could not even reasonably think that I was going into a contract for a credit card application, then with all due respect, there is no way that an ordinary reasonable person could have thought that it is actually a credit card contract they are going into. My point and conclusion here is, if this company and specifically this store is not getting punished for this, they might even defraud more people into getting credit cards they do not even consent to.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","NY","122XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-06-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7068614,2023

The issue here is that my credit card was left behind and an excessive amount of charges were present on my credit card without my knowledge, and approval. I never received the receipt or even signed the receipt, therefore when contacting the establishment in person, they neglected to provide me with the receipt and failed to follow through with providing me with any documentation. 
In turn, I contacted Barclays about this situation, after serval months of going back and forth from disputes to fraud department, they failed to assist me in obtaining the documentation from the merchant. The irony here, after several attempts I finally received documentation from Barclays stating I was not held responsible and they favored with me, removing the charge from my account a few days later I see the reversed the charge back to my credit card. 

When contacting them for 6th time, they stated that they had closed this case and favored with the merchant and I had asked how they could do this without having any supporting information. They claimed a receipt was not needed, as the card holder is responsible because I presented the card to the merchant. 

This makes absolutely no sense to me and without a signed receipt, this seems to me as being a fraudulent charge. 

The issue now stands that my account is in default for non payment, reported to all credit agencies as default payment and now tarnishing my credit rating. 

I would like this matter addressed getting the supporting documentation that I initially requested along with penalties applied to Barclays for negligence of supporting their card holders. Based on the findings posted on reviews I have found that Barclays has neglected to represent and provide support to the card holders in turn this should be addressed.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","VA","22314","","Consent provided","Web",2023-01-24,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",6399182,2023

We arrived at the XXXX XXXX XXXX hotel around XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX due to a long flight delay. However, there was a NO VACANCY sign at the front desk and the person that came to the window didn't even ask if I had a reservation, didn't even offer an apology, she just gestured with her hand pointing to the NO VACANCY sign. 

So, we had to leave the XXXX XXXX XXXX and find another hotel, fortunately for us we found a XXXX XXXX hotel that had vacancies, by now it was early morning Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX. So, after having been rejected by the XXXX XXXX XXXX, I decided to stay for the whole week at the XXXX XXXX. I called XXXX to let them know what had happened when we went to XXXX XXXX XXXX to check in and left a voice message, but they alleged they didn't receive it. 

Fast forward to present, I have tried in vain to resolve this matter with Barclay 's the bank that issued the Priceline credit card. They asked me to provide them with a letter from the merchant XXXX XXXX XXXX stating that they had cancelled my reservation, I called XXXX XXXX XXXX  and spoke with a manager who emailed me such letter and I forwarded it to Barclay as proof that the charges for the one-week stay are plain wrong. I also included a copy of the receipt XXXX XXXX gave me when I checked out on Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX as additional proof I'm being wrongly charged. 

Barclay 's replied that the documents I provided are weak that they needed a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX stating that the reason for cancelling my reservation was due to no vacancies for the night of XX/XX/XXXX. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX again and spoke to a manager assistant who told me that she couldn't provide such a letter because she wasn't the manager on duty that night. By now I have spoken to several customer service people from Barclay 's who told me they were going to escalate my issue with their billing disputes department, but nothing has happened, I was finally able to speak with XXXX different account managers who even though were polite and respectful couldn't really help me. I have reminded them that I'm a long-time customer of Priceline and of Barclay 's . Having always paid all of my bills amounting to thousands of dollars in full, but they just don't care about that, they are just trying to make me responsible for a debt I didn't incur and for which I'm not responsible. it was XXXX XXXX XXXX who cancelled my reservation not me. For me this isn't about the money, it's about the principle, to do what is right, I have been doing the right thing by being a loyal customer and always paying the debts that I have incurred and are legitimate. These XXXX characters, Priceline and Barclay 's are not really interested in doing the right thing because they continue to harass me demanding payment from me and had sent a negative report to XXXX that is damaging my good name and credit. Last month my XXXX XXXX was considered excellent XXXX but now is only a fair XXXX. I hope that you can clearly see who is in the wrong in this dispute and help me restore my good reputation and credit.

I have done everything with in my rights and I am legally due a refund and I will explain why for both parties to review. This is in regards to case id XXXX Barclays bank. Order number for XXXX is XXXX. This has caused an enormous amount of stress on me. I purchased an I phone and received the wrong merchandise. I filed a dispute with my bank and they are denying my claim for order Apple XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Unlocked Brand New Sealed XXXX XXXX XXXX  Gold Box '' because they are stating the following. They do not receive text like messages as proof this makes no sense because XXXX website via computer or via is phone like to obtain the proof I logged in with my phone to the XXXX XXXX to report the incident and in XXXX Policy it clearly states report any issues via website or via app and in this case I reported the issue with in the website on my phone and snap shotted the conversation showing date/time of interaction with XXXX. Barclays is stating they dont accept that which is not a valid reason because XXXX website is designed like that. If XXXX states to report that way then Barclays must accept this as a form of proof because XXXX does accept images like that and that is my proof that the issue was reported with in the time frame allowed by XXXX per there return policy which states the following. If you receive an item that is not in the condition described in the listing, you may file a return request within 3 days of delivery of the order. Please note that you will not be able to file a return request for an order if you have already accepted the order. according to USPS tracking number and XXXX XXXX tracker tracking number XXXX shows delivered on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX and the issue was reported on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX which was well with in the allowed time by XXXX per there policy. I was at work until XX/XX/XXXX once I got home from work thats when it was discovered. I drive a truck and I was at work once I got home it was immediately reported via website on my phone. Another reason Barclays is denying is because they are stating I did not report the incident on time. Yes I sure did report it on time. It was reported the 2nd day and I had 3 days to report it. Per XXXX policy states I report by the app or website which I did. They also state report any issues with in 3 days which I did in 2 days. Another reason why they are denying my claim is they are stating the merchant never agreed to refund you. THIS MAKES NO SENSE. I absolutely DO NOT CARE IF THEY AGREED OR NOT. Here is why. I ORDERED A XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Unlocked Brand New Sealed XXXX XXXX XXXX Gold Box '' IS THAT WHAT I RECEIVED? No! I never agreed to pay {$2000.00} for a XXXX box! I paid {$2000.00} for a phone! What ever happened in transit or with in that time frame is OUT OF MY CONTROL! I have proof of what I received! I NEVER BOUGHT A XXXX!!! I PURCHASED A PHONE! Therefore I AM DEEMED A REFUND! Legally I am owed a refund! I DID NOT PAY XXXX XXXXXXXX for that ITEM I ORDERED A PHONE! No where in my receipt does it state I will be receiving a XXXX! It states a XXXX and thats because thats what I ORDERED! I have proof and XXXX asked to see the pics and I showed it to them! They are violating there policy! I received the wrong and I reported it in the website browser with in 3 days. I have done everything with in XXXX policy and legally I am owed a refund BECAUSE I DID NOT PAY {$2000.00} for XXXX box. Barclays and XXXX are refusing to resolve this when I have done and sent them all kinds of proof/images/conversation proof and both parties are holding me responsible by not issuing my refund that owed to me. I never agreed to pay for XXXX. I never ordered this. I ordered a phone. Legally I owed a refund. Thats like ( example given ) XXXX order a blue t-shirt and receiving a book and me not resolving it. How is that XXXX fault? If the issue occurred outside of his control thats not his fault but yet me holding him responsible. Barclays and XXXX are holding an innocent consumer responsible for an issue that was outside of my reach and I did everything in the time frame allowed and given yet Barclays and XXXX are holding me responsible for an issue that I had no control over. The reasons for denying this claim makes no sense and I keep informing them and sending them my proof however they are not getting this issue rectified. This concern has caused an abundance amount of stress on me. I have tried several times and have sent all the proof they are yet resolve this. Once again I have all the proof what I ordered and I have proof what I received. I followed XXXX policy. Barclays is also stating XXXX never agreed for a refund nor did they send you a return label. That makes no sense!! XXXX policy states report any issues with in 3 days and I did. Whether they sent me a return label or not does not change the fact that I HAVE PROOF WHAT I ORDERED. I never ordered a XXXX. On my legal document which is my receipt it states what I ordered. I never paid {$2000.00} for a XXXX box. Whether the issue occured while in transit or on delivery XXXX thats NOT MY FAULT NOR IN MY CONTROL! Whats in my control is whether I follow the process that XXXX stated which I have because I CONTACTED THEM ON TIME ALLOWED BY POSHMARK! Thats in my control! I have no control over what happens to my package while in transit! I am deemed and owed my refund legally. I never paid for a XXXX box. If this issue is not rectified my next course of action is to report this issue to the XXXX department of CA because I as a consumer offered {$2000.00} XXXX and received a wrong item. I never agreed to pay for a XXXX box. Please resolve this issue. Once again what happens in transit has absolutely nothing to do with me nor is it in my control. I am owed my refund. I am wrongfully being denied a refund that is legally owed to me. I filed a return request on time ( 2nd day ). It does not matter if XXXX did not send me a return label does not change the faxt that on my receipt it states XXXX and I did not receive that. Show me proof that states you XXXX receive a wrong item? I do not see anything like that on the receipt that was generated by XXXX. I did everything I was told to and yet Barclays and XXXX both are refusing to help me in this matter. I have sent all the proof Barclays needed yet they are not legally helping me. The package was damaged and tampered with and my actual item was stolen and Barclays and XXXX are refusing to refund me. I never ordered XXXX.

I pay my purchases off every month and continue to pay down the balance transfer amount. Now the company says I agreed to a 20 percent interest amount on the balance transfer. I most definately did not. This transfer transaction was made over the phone. I agreed to a XXXX percent transaction. They say they record these calls.

Not only were these transactions large, and placed after I lost my card, but they incurred cash advance fees which themselves are problematic because XXXX ) the transaction generally are not cash advances and XXXX ) interest and fees have accurred. 

I reported this activity to the bank when I noticed this on my statement first on XX/XX/XXXX. I locked the account. 
To my surprise, I never was issued a provisional credit and nothing was done, and my account was unlocked without my consent. So on XX/XX/XXXX I again reported the transactions and locked my account. Again, no credits were issued and I received no correspondence or updated. So on XX/XX/XXXX I again reported the transaction, locked the account, and again no update or credits were issued. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I called the company, I again reported the incidents, I was told a provisional credit would be issued in 24-48 hours. 

Then on XX/XX/XXXX I got a bill from the company which claimed my account was past due and showed the full balance along with additional accumulated interest and late fees. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I called, first I was told no provisional credits were issued because I did not make a minimum payment. However, I did not have to make a minimum payment because the amount of the provisional credit I should have received was larger than the entire balance since the fraud went on over multiple billing cycles, of which the prior one I paid. 

Thus, Barclays is not following the law, they are not issuing me provisional credits, they are telling me I do not qualify unless I make a minimum payment ( even though they owe me money as I already paid for one of these fraudulent transactions ). 
They continue to assess late fees and interest, and they have provided me with NO correspond or updates.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","VA","201XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-02-25,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6611138,2023

Barclays Dispute Department was sent a XXXX page document, including photos, supporting this dispute. The documents were sent on XX/XX/2023 via United States Postal Service, Priority Mail No. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and delivered to Barclays on XX/XX/2023. 

On XX/XX/2023, Barclays issued a letter stating """" Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain credit on your behalf because the services were rendered for the transaction and the merchant is due payment. '' Barclays position as stated to me is, since my wife and I stayed at the resort, services were rendered. 

Barclays findings that The services were rendered for the transaction and the merchant is due payment is flawed. The services of a hotel or resort are not rendered solely based on an individuals stay. Barclays decision not to properly investigate my dispute violates federal laws which protects a consumer who receives """" bad services ''. Federal laws also affords a consumer the right to dispute charges for transactions that they were """" dissatisfied with. '' The Fair Credit Billing Act protects the rights of a consumer to dispute """" bad service '' IF THE CONSUMER DIDN'T RECEIVE THE SERVICE THEY PAID FOR, OR IF THE SERVICE PROVIDER DIDN'T MEET THE CONSUMERS EXPECTATION. 
The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) also provides a consumer rights and protections with regards to disputing a charge for bad service. 

As a consumer, I have a reasonable expectation that a merchant, in this case, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX would provide the services I was paying for, a clean, sanitary, well maintained, functional, and safe villa. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to do so, thus invalidating any claim that services were provided and payment was due. 

Barclays failed to take into account the merits of the dispute as documented in the XXXX letter sent to their office on XX/XX/2023. That letter clearly shows the substandard and unsanitary conditions which existed at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The written and photographic evidence provided to Barclays not only substantiate the merits of the dispute, it justifies a chargeback. 

I believe Barclays Bank violated federal laws and regulations regarding the processing of this dispute when it failed contact the merchant, present my complaint to the merchant, request a written response from the merchant, or request a chargeback from the merchant. 

Barclays Disputes Department later claimed I selected the wrong type of dispute from their limited list of options.

A Barclays dispute manager told me during a phone conversation, Barclays does not have to comply with federal laws or regulations. They only need to abide by Barclays policies.

XXXX XXXX XXXX sent the required notice of debt on XX/XX/XXXX to an address I have not resided at since XXXX. This is because Barclays continues to use the identity theft information on file and they provided that wrong address to XXXX XXXX when they sold the debt to them. 

This notice was forwarded to my current address. I responded to the notice from XXXX XXXX XXXX via certified mail on XX/XX/XXXX to their XXXX XXXX Address listed on the notice.

'' XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX never responded to my identity theft dispute that was sent certified mail nor did they reply to my email of dispute sent to XXXX. 

The FDCPA states that when a consumer disputes a debt, collection activity and measures must stop until the dispute is resolved. XXXX violated the FDCPA when they ignored my mailed dispute and emailed dispute and continued to contact me about this debt. I am a victim of identity theft.

I paid for my purchases as soon as I received notice of them I dispute any remaining balance on the account, which I have closed. Here is my story. 

I have had a Gap credit card since XXXX. Unbeknownst to me, the financial institution that issued the card sold the account to Barclaycard sometime during summer XXXX. Also unbeknownst to me, without request to or permission from me, or paper notice to me, Barclaycard switched me from paper statements to paperless statements. 

The first I learned of this was a form letter received XXXX XXXX claiming my account was XXXX months overdue ( copy attached ). I called on or about XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to a rep who unfortunately had limited XXXX proficiency. This is when I learned that I had been switched to paperless statements. I searched my email, but had received no emails from Barclaycard. The rep told me to check the spam folder. All the emails from Barclaycard had gone to spam, which I do not read. Opening one of the spam emails, I learned that paperless statements is actually a misnomer, since the emails they sent out are not statements, but merely notices that ones statement is available in ones online account, along with an overall balance. 

Of course, I did not have an online account since I believed I was still getting paper statements. I requested the rep to switch me back to paper statements, and send me paper copies of all prior statements since they bought the account. 

The rep converted me to paper statements, but sent me the most recent statement only. 

Shortly thereafter, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX saying my account was now three months past due, along with the current statement. 

I called again and spoke to XXXX, employee # XXXX, who agreed to send me all back statements and make a note in the file that I had not received any bills since Barclaycard bought the account. 

I received the back statements on XX/XX/XXXX, and immediately set up an electronic payment for {$430.00}, which was the full value of all purchases made, less returns. The next statement, dated XX/XX/XXXX showed a balance of {$190.00}, which is all fees and interest. 

I called again to have Barclaycard waive the fees and interest since the switch to paperless statements was not my error. The rep was not authorized to do that. I asked for someone with more authority, but that manager refused to credit the amounts, claiming that it wasnt Barclaycards error ; the previous institution had informed Barclaycard we were getting paperless statements.

Regardless of which bank made the error, I am not responsible for that error and do not rightfully or legally owe the {$190.00} in fees and interest.

Also of note, all email systems have a read receipt capability. Barclaycard had the ability, had they chosen to use it, to KNOW I had never opened any emails from them. Also Barclaycard knew or should have known that I never set up an online account, so could never have viewed any statements.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","PA","19083","","Consent provided","Web",2023-05-21,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7007356,2023

2023-05-18,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Fees or interest","Charged too much interest","I pay by statement balances in full every month. In XXXX / XX/XX/2023, GAP changed their credit card service provider from XXXX XXXX to Barclays. Subsequently, I was asked to create a new account and link my bank account, setup auto-pay, etc. Even though I added my bank details, etc., due to unclear user interface, I was told that I was not enrolled in auto-pay, resulting in my payment for the XXXX statement being delayed by 1 day. I explained this to the Barclays bank and they credited the late fee back to my account. Since then, i have had auto-pay setup to pay my entire statement balance in full each month. 

Even though I am enrolled in auto-pay to pay my balance in full, I am still seeing interest charge for purchases on my statement. When I contacted the credit card company, I was provided the below explanation : """"... Upon review of your account, we see that your XX/XX/ statement balance was not paid in full. 

When your statement balance is not paid in full by the XXXX XXXX XXXX cut off time on your payment due date shown on your statements, you're assessed interest, which accrues based on the average daily balance. We currently use a method called 'daily balance ( including new purchases ) to calculate interest. Please keep in mind that we calculate interest separately for each Balance Subject to Interest Rate. Examples include purchases at your current annual percentage rate ( APR ), balance transfers, cash advances, and different promotional balances. Your monthly billing statements show each Balance Subject to Interest Rate within the Interest Charge Calculation section. To calculate interest, we first calculate the average daily balance for each Balance Subject to Interest Rate. This is done by taking the balance on the previous day, subtracting any payments or credits, and adding any purchases posted that day. The result is the total balance for the day. This process is repeated for each day in your statement cycle. At the end of the month, all of the daily balances are added together and divided by the number of days in the statement cycle, which equals your average daily balance. 

As a reminder, the amount of interest assessed when your billing cycle closes each month will depend on the average daily balance and number of days per billing cycle. The higher the average daily balance and the more days there are in the billing cycle, the higher the interest charge. 
... .. """" Based on the above method of calculating interest, consumers will be paying interest in perpetuity as long as they keep using their card on a monthly basis. When I enrolled in auto-pay, there is no option available to clear or pay the entire amount. The only options available are to pay """" statement balance '', """" minimum due '' and """" other amount ''. Considering that this is auto-pay, """" other amount '' is not practical. I have it set to pay the """" statement balance ''. If this bank is going to charge interest based on daily balance, they should have an option to pay whatever is necessary for users to be free of monthly interest charges. Both online and in their monthly statements in mail. The only way to get rid of this interest charge is to not use their card for a month or pay more than the statement balance to bring down the daily balance to XXXX. 

I find this unethical and unfair for consumers and so bringing this to your attention.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","TX","78681","","Consent provided","Web",2023-05-19,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",6996822,2023

2023-01-10,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Fees or interest","Problem with fees","Hi there, I noticed that I was charged an annual fee of {$99.00} on my credit card ending with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I called Barclays on XX/XX/XXXX to either downgrade to a version without annual fee or cancel this card to get the annual fee refunded since I will not travel as much as I did in XXXX. As a result, I will barely use this card moving forward and won't be able to utilize the card 's benefits ( haven't used this card since XX/XX/XXXX ). However, the customer service representative informed me that the annual fee was posted on XX/XX/XXXX, which results in passing the 60-day window of getting the refund, so they could not process the refund. That was quite a surprise to me. 

I then looked closely at my account from Barclays ' website. I found that the page showing the transactions is very misleading ( see attached ). It shows the """" Posted transactions '' at the top-left corner with the date of XX/XX/XXXX above it and the date of XX/XX/XXXX appears again below the """" XXXX '' at the bottom. 

And the date of """" XX/XX/XXXX '' is relatively unnoticeable since it's smaller and lighter compared with the capitalized words """" ANNUAL FEE '' right above it. This layout, especially the date """" XX/XX/XXXX '' below the """" XXXX '' makes it very impelling to believe that the {$99.00} annual fee was charged on XX/XX/XXXX, which leads to the result that I missed the 60-day window of getting the refund.

XXXX has advised me to dispute this through my bank in which I did. No wonder Barclays can not provide any information on the investigation and just say they talked to them over the phone. XXXX closed my dispute and has refused to reopen it even though they state they confirmed with XXXX it was returned and XXXX would credit me within a few days but then XXXX is stating they never even spoke to them. 

Re-open my dispute with XXXX for {$57.00} and credit me the amount I am owed from this merchant which is {$57.00} as its been months and they have yet to refund me and XXXX had stated they confirmed with XXXX it was returned but not credited. Also to NEVER send me a letter filled with XXXX lies again, double check your XXXX employees work, because they pulled {$17.00} on XX/XX/2023 out of their XXXX and did not do their job. 

ALSO MAIL ME A XXXX LETTER I contacted my bank Barclays about a refund with XXXX for {$57.00}, I never received. I returned the item in store on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX camera can confirm ) and even took a picture of the item being in store before leaving because the lady did not give a receipt since it was originally ordered online ( picture I provided XXXX XXXX shows I dropped off the item, even shows XXXX XXXX and Customer Service Desk in the background ). After a month went past, I reached out to XXXX, who told me to open a dispute with my bank. I did and after opening one, over two weeks go by & I dont hear anything from Barclays about it even though I forsure provided proof. I contact Barclays & speak to a manager who tells me they reached out to XXXX & confirmed it was returned and I would see a credit in a few days. A few days go by & I dont see a credit, I receive a letter in the mail after asking the manager that day to re-send the letter that he said was apparently sent out to me about a credit. When I received the letter, the letter stated the opposite and stated Barclays investigated and XXXX refunded me on XX/XX/ for {$17.00} and my dispute is considered closed but in my favor. I was completely confused from this letter because 1. I NEVER received a credit for {$17.00}, XXXX. There is no activity on my account at all on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX. How is it considered closed when I paid {$57.00} for the item and not {$17.00}, so even if they refunded me {$17.00} in which they didnt, that still doesnt equal to {$57.00} how can you even give less than half a refund when I returned the whole thing which was one item and that one item was a mattress topper. Barclays claim to have investigated the issue with XXXX but it seems as though they didnt. I receive a letter dated XX/XX/ about how they were going to investigate and then on XX/XX/ it was all completed within such a short period of time. 

I called on XX/XX/ about this letter because not only does it state the complete opposite of what I was told, its filled with lies. Barclays did NOT investigate this transaction at all, and most likely thought I would just accept the letter and move on, or completely forget. I never received a refund from XXXX for that amount on that day, I researched my account looking for it and there is NOTHING of the sorts, I double checked bank statements and transaction history. On XX/XX/XXXX, after calling XXXX multiple times about this letter and to explain to me why they did not actually investigate this and why the XXXX would they say I was refunded on this certain day and I actually wasnt. I asked the representative to find the transaction on my account to confirm with the letter I received and she couldnt and stated she was confused on why I received the letter as well. 

I asked this dispute representative to put me in touch with a Manager to get to the bottom of this and also re-open my dispute and actually investigate it because as of XX/XX/ I still dont have the refund of {$57.00} not even a partial refund from it and I dont have the product. The merchant CAN NOT keep the product and keep my money as well. Every representative refused to allow me to speak to a manager and stated one wasnt available, even though they were unable to figure this out. I asked for them to set up a call back with a manager because this letter is inaccurate. The representative who refused a manager then told me on the phone that a entirely different charge for a completely different purchase from XXXX which amounted in {$16.00} on XX/XX/2023 and a different one for {$0.00} was the refund that I was owed from the dispute of {$57.00} and refused to listen when I stated multiple times its not, that was an entirely different purchase and XXXX still owes me {$57.00}. I also asked for proof of this information and if that is what XXXX is claiming and not just the representative herself, to provide XXXX that documentation that shows what she is claiming is coming from XXXX themselves because at this point its all he/she said. XXXX XXXX is basically speaking on behalf of XXXX without showing XXXX the customer any proof of communications with XXXX. I would like all proof and the receipts XXXX have apparently provided to XXXX that shows the {$16.00} & {$0.00} are directly related to the original charge of {$57.00} because if an investigation was actually done & Barclays reached out to XXXX they would give me the supporting documents that were used to verify I was refunded but XXXX CAN NOT DO THAT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT ACTUALLY INVESTIGATE. 

I am making this complaint to have the company that closely monitors Banks contact Barclays so they are AWARE of what Barclays is doing, have Barclays re-open my dispute, and also provide me all the documentation that the merchant provided to support the {$17.00} that was apparently refunded to me. Once again I have NOT received a refund from XXXX, I bought a mattress topper for a total of {$57.00}, I RETURNED the mattress topper that cost {$57.00} but have yet to receive that refund to my Barclays account. I also have yet to receive a call back from Barclays as of XX/XX/ even though I was told someone would call me back after being refused a manager multiple times on XX/XX/2023. I called at least XXXX times on XX/XX/2023trying to get this resolved and at this point XXXX is refusing. 

As of XX/XX/2023I tried reaching out to Barclays again about the issue. I reached out to their billing disputes department and regular department by calling XXXX which is the number listed on the letter and called XXXX which is listed on the back of my card. Ok today XX/XX/2023 the associate I first spoke too acted clueless on what I was talking about, so I once again asked for a manager where I was put on hold for a long time & then I get told either the manager isnt available or the associate tried to relay a message of what the manager apparently said, even though I have asked multiple times to speak to one MYSELF, as the regular associates employee, XXXX who works in the disputes department, I spoke to on XX/XX/2023 could not get manager on the phone after asked for one more than two times and stated it takes XXXX for a call back. When I called multiple last week and more than XXXX have passed. 

I am also attaching pictures of the original letter I received, and also the same letter I received again after asking the associate to mail it out to me again, the day I asked this was on XX/XX/ as the first XXXX hadnt showed up yet. The reprint of my statement is not actually my statement it was the letter about the {$57.00} being in dispute. 

Please also note, I am attaching pictures of my call log, of me speaking to XXXX on XX/XX/2023 where I was told the {$57.00} would be credited to my account within a few days. The same number I called, is the same number on the back of my card. 

Please also note the dates of the letters I received of XXXX closing my case & saying I was issued {$17.00}, it is dated XX/XX/ a day before I spoke to an associate who never once on XX/XX/XXXX mention anything about what the letter said nor did he ever state I was already apparently credited, I wasnt told the dispute was closed either on this day even though on his end he could see this letter as he was the one that told me a letter was sent out & I simply requested it to be sent again because I did not know. This employee willing withheld this information from me while I kept asking when did XXXX speak to XXXX, when will I receive something stating Im being credited the {$57.00}, I can see now all the questions I asked this associate he just lied because why not mention & say whoever investigated the issue apparently said I was credited already. 

I would advise ALL XXXX XXXX holders when filing a dispute with this XXXX disgusting company to get ALL documentation & communication that went into investigating the dispute as it is our right. 

I had to reach out to XXXX once again after speaking to XXXX multiple times on XX/XX/ about my refund and how I just got off the phone with my bank who was saying they reached out to them and also connected the calls together so XXXX can hear the XXXX come from my banks mouths. And then after that XXXX manually processed a refund because my bank was claiming they raised a dispute. 

At the end of the day Barclays lied and proved they dont investigate some claims made by customers.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","IL","61801","","Consent provided","Web",2023-07-31,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7330463,2023

2 ) For 3 years I used XX/XX/XXXX, and paid XX/XX/XXXX with 0 late pays or problems. In fact, I've had a credit history since XXXX, and never had a Late Pay on any card, loan, or obligation, and have an unblemished credit report in terms of never being late for > 35 years as a consumer. 
3 ) Barclays did a horrible job in conversion in verifying correct email address, apparently.

4 ) I have talked to 6 Barclays Reps since XX/XX/XXXX to try to resolve this issue. 
5 ) From all these conversations- this appears to be the facts : - Account conversions from XXXX to Barclays for XXXX cardholders took place XXXX, XXXX. 
- I was receiving emails from XXXX and Barclays in advance of conversion at XXXX. 
- Barclays did very little in terms of email validation. For instance, in setting up this CFPB comparing there is an email verification that takes place. Barclays did not do any email validation when I was asked to setup an account with Barclays. 
- It appears Barclays, even though they had my correct email initially from XXXX, allowed for a typo to result in account setup, or Barclays set up my email wrong. Email was set up as XXXX -- according to my phone conversation with a Barclays rep. 
- I use the card very little, so initially had a pay problem in fall, but rectified it before credit report was hit. Barclays did not ask for email verification at that time either. 
- My wife used card in XXXX, XXXX - unknowingly to me. The bills were not coming to me, as the Email address was wrong. 
- In XXXX, XXXX I was alerted by XXXX XXXX  of a 30 day late pay notice. I've never had one of these in 35 years of credit usage. 
- I immediately called Barclays, on XX/XX/XXXX - and paid the bill in full. I had not received the Any Bills from Barclays --- they said the email address was with the wrong two """" ee 's '' in my name was valid, so they won't change the late pay notice on my credit report. 
My credit report dropped XXXX points with on bureau. 
- Everyone at Barclays agrees I had wrong email, it is corrected now. But, no one will go back and make a """" technology error '' adjustment and remove the Late pay. They say I have to have it on my report for the next 7 years. 
- Now, I'm getting emotional because of writing this. After XX/XX/XXXX hours of conversations with 6 representatives, still no one will repair / correct this issue. 
- Barclays is taking now responsibility for poor conversion practices, that didn't validate emails, and not taking an consumer friendly approach to fixing a mistake. 
- The late pay was only {$400.00} by the way, and it was paid within one hour of me realizing there was an outstanding balance. My wife 's use of the card ( and me not knowing ), and her thinking it was on """" auto pay '' are the additional details that explain the mistake. 
- I remain Shocked that no one at Barclays will be more reasonable to this, given the whole problem arose from an Account conversion without adequate controls in place to avoid an accidental typo that occurred.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","GA","30097","","Consent provided","Web",2023-07-10,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7226947,2023

I have to admit I have been very ignorant of the Laws that protect consumers from discrimination like this. It has become very clear to me that financial institutions such as this one have no regard for the LAWs that protect consumers from such discrimination. I have offered a very simple solution to move forward with business as usual, but Barclays Bank has no intention of recognizing who I am as the soul signatory to the account ending in XXXX. I have also stated in my adverse action letters that I know in """" FACT '' that I am the originator of credit. Barclays is NOT providing me with credit, I am extending my credit to Barclays Bank which is coded in Title 15 sec.1691a ( b ). By accepting my application they have accepted trusteeship in a fiduciary obligation and I have yet to receive any benefit for their use of my private account information. 

I would like to add the definition of a Creditor : a person who, in the ordinary course of business, regularly participates in a credit decision, including setting the terms of the credit. The creditor includes a creditor assigner, transferee, or subrogee who participates. The term creditor also includes a person who, in the ordinary course of business, regularly refers applicants or prospective applicants to creditors, or selects or offers to select creditors to whom a request for credit may be made. A person is not a creditor regarding any violation of the act or this part committed by another creditor unless the person knew or had reasonable notice of the act policy or practice that constituted the violation before becoming involved in the credit transaction. THE TERM DOES NOT INCLUDE A PERSON WHOSE ONLY PARTICIPATION IN A CREDIT TRANSACTION INVOLVES HONORING A CREDIT CARD. 

Title 15 sec.1691a ( d ) The term """" credit '' means the right granted by a creditor to a debtor to defer payment of a debt or to incur debts and defer its payment or to purchase property or services and defer payment therefor. 
( f ) The term """" person '' means a natural person, a corporation, government or governmental subdivision or agency, trust, estate, partnership, cooperative, or association. 

Under the ( U.D.A.A.P ) Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts and Practices, this delay of benefits has caused monetary harm to my family and me by denying access to products and services that I the """" applicant '' have in good faith applied for. 

Such discrimination could have been avoided by Barclays Bank if the representative from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX would have and could have conducted a proper interview with me to further gather information to overturn this denial. 

Barclays Bank assumes I am incapable of managing my account/affairs based on misinformation provided by XXXX alone which is known for deceptive business practices and the CFPB has a record of that. 

I gave Barclays Bank ample time to correct their wrongs but to no avail have not answered any of the """" Facts '' I have provided to them.

2023-01-30,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Other features, terms, or problems","Problem with rewards from credit card","While on a flight on XX/XX/XXXX, I was incented to apply for a credit card with Barclays bank to get XXXX bonus miles the first time I used the card for any amount ( """" welcome bonus '' ). Subsequently my application was approved, I received the card in the mail, and activated it without a problem. The first time I attempted to use the card at a local merchant on XX/XX/XXXX - the charge was declined. I tried using the card again the same day at another merchant with the same result. On XX/XX/XXXX I spent 30 minutes with their customer service call center to finally get an answer that my card was not able to be used until I provided 'know your customer ' documents by mail to the bank in spite of already being a Barclays customer with another open credit card. And, the Security department is not open on Sunday so I would have to call back. I requested confirmation in writing of which documents would be acceptable to clear the XXXX and be able to use my card. 

I was traveling internationally during the following week and attempted to use my other Barclays card on XX/XX/XXXX and that charge was declined. I called the Customer Service number again and was told they couldn't help me and I need to call a different number. That resulted in a call to a call center with a 90 minute wait time, directed to their customer service website that has no option for providing any XXXX documentation or list of acceptable documents. 

So now adverse action has been taken on both of my credit card accounts ( no access to my available credit ) without a solution or any documentation on why ( no written direction was received after my XX/XX/XXXX request for how to lift the block on my card ). I also have a specific timeframe to use my card to get the promised XXXX miles in my airline account and no way to use my card to get them. This also feels like a bit of bait and switch, there is no apparent reason for my account to have been flagged for XXXX documents since I'm an existing customer.

2023-02-28,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Getting a credit card","Delay in processing application","On XXXX XXXX I applied online for an American Airlines Advantage Aviator Red World Elite Mastercard issued by Barclays and provided all requested information. Approval odd were excellent, and I had several preapproval offers options from multiple other cards issuers to include other AAdvantage card. I have excellent credit and no issue obtaining credit elsewhere. I received a letter on XXXX XXXX from Barclay stating they need a Driver License/State/Gov ID, Social Security Card, current utility bill and bank statement to verify my address and had 30 days from date of letter ( XXXX XXXX ) to provide. The form letter had no phone number, no email address, no contact name, just a po box address to mail documents. This should have been my first flag, it just didn't feel right ; I attempted to call the customer service number on the website, but its a series of prompts that will not take you to a live person. I called the number for application status, that initially told me to reference a """" my status app link ''. I called back and got a live person who would not help me unless I submitted another credit application. I explained that I already have one, and she stated the system does not allow them to see applications already in process and that I can process a new one over the phone... why would I do that and take another credit hit. I tried two other numbers and finally got a live person when I called the fraud office. I spoke to them in detail about my concerns and was given a fax number to use and list of acceptable documents to verify identity and address. I faxed over clear & legible documents along with my contact info to confirm receipt. I called back a couple of days later and they still could not provide an update or confirm receipt. I was directed to XXXX the package which Barclays received on XXXX XXXX As the fraud rep directed, the package included the original letter, a letter asking them to contact me upon receipt, a copy of my military ID, copy of Passport, a Property Tax Statement, a water Bill XXXX and a XXXX XXXX  statement. ( Note : I did not have to provide this much information when I bought a house or car last year ). They did not follow up or contact me as requested, so I called them on XXXX XXXX, was bounced from person to person until I reach the security department, who then proceeded to tell me application was still on hold and they need more information and I now need to provide a a front and back copy of my social security card and current IRS 1040 document to further prove my identity as my military ID did not have my date on birth. I told them that should not matter as the DOB was on the passport which is legal proof of identity under the Real ID act. I was then connected to another representative, where I had to explain everything again. They assured me documents were for identity and not proof of employer or income. I explained that this was a lot of PII data that they are collecting, especially when documents already provided 100 % match info on credit report. I also wanted to know how PII was being protected under this process, Barclays answer was we will shred it when final decision is made or 6 months whichever comes first. I asked them to send me a letter stating why they needed more information as a SSN card is not considered legal proof of identity, and off course they refused to provided. I asked why a notice was not already sent as they had my identity documents for two week already, rep stated they only send one letter per applicant ( either a denial or request for information ) and had I not called back in, they would have just timed out my application & denied me with no further contact. Rep then proceeded to tell me they require this information from all applicants and it was standard business practice for identity verification. I immediately googled and no where could I find that this was a standard practice, to the contrary another Barclays site listed the same documents already provided as acceptable. Reached out to a few friends who have this card, and they were never asked for this information. I asked Barclay rep was there something in my profile triggering this, I would like to know so I can fix it and not have to go through this with another creditor. I was told they don't have to provide me with that information and that they can just deny the application if I wont provide them with a front and back copy of SSN card and/or 1040. ( note : the back of the card says protect card, prevent misuse, keep it in a safe place and never carry it with you ). If I had not found the Barclay 's number myself, I would swear this whole process was a fishing scam ; since when is a passport not considered ID, Military ID stop having DOB on them 15 years ago, a 1040 is not proof of identity as any one with XXXX XXXX can doctor a 1040. There is no legal requirement to even provide a social security number on the application, so how can they base approval or denial on not providing the actual SSN card. I asked why I could not use the identity verification app like other CC companies ( website says they have one ) I was told that was for current customer only despite the fact website clearly states for New Barclay Consumer wishing to apply for services. I was given yet another po box to mail updated document. I believe I am being profiled based on demographic information on the report ( military status, residential addresses, etc. ) as they wont disclose why I am being flagged. It almost seem like they are trying to make process difficult so I will give up which will give them justification to deny me. I have a 750+ credit score, 15 years of positive trade line, card utilization under 19 %, no late payments, great debt to income ratio, two inquires, no collections, so what's the issue. I have a high level government clearance and know the risk associated with collecting this much PII from one person ; If I had not called in, that paperwork would sit 6 month prior to being destroyed, who does paper anything in this day an age, and everything they are asking for now can be """" dummied up '' by a 13 year old. There was no option to elevate my issue or appeal the decision, either send the documents requested or don't. Again, the fact that I provided valid and recent identity documents as listed on the website/letter that did not clear the flag, coupled with the fact that they will not disclose what generated the flag over the phone or in writing leads me to believe there is a unfair process at play that needs to be investigated and corrected or organization sanctioned for its perceived profiling practices. I would have preferred an upfront denial over this current practice which puts my identity more at risk than issuing the credit card would have. If this """" identity validation practice '' is part of the screen out process for certain """" flagged group of consumers '' I would advise military, divorced women, minorities, and anyone choosing to live in an """" up and coming or investment neighbor '' to proceed with caution, you may be wasting your time and end up with a credit inquiry and no card. I now have to go put a lock on my credit just in case my data get comprised internal to Barclays.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","NC","275XX","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2023-02-28,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6621263,2023

I went to go make my payment when it was due but when I went to make the payment, I could not get into my account online. I called customer service and found out they gave me a new account number as the company had gotten bought out. The representative I spoke with helped me pay and ensured me I would have no late fees as I did not even know, nor was I notified that I was given a new account. 

Then in XXXX of XXXX, I received an additional bill of around {$35.00} as a late fee from the XXXX statement. I immediately called the company and they said it was a fluke and that I would have a {$0.00} balance soon. I was told I just needed to wait another billing cycle to get it fixed. 

Then I got a statement in XXXX showing a new late fee from the previous late fee back from XXXX of XXXX. I immediately called the company and asked to speak with a supervisor. I was told that my account was not showing a XXXX dollar balance, and that it was showing XXXX late fees. I went through the process of having them try to remove the late fees again and was told that it would be fixed on the next billing cycle. Then I got another bill towards the end of XX/XX/XXXX with the same amount. I immediately called them ( again ) and spoke to another supervisor, and had them create another ticket to get it resolved. I was informed that the ticket would be expedited, and that I would be called when it got resolved. I have yet to be called. Mind you, all of these calls are recorded. 

Fast forward to now, I just got another statement on XX/XX/XXXX, showing an additional, third, late fee from the original one back in XXXX of XXXX. This was even after I had spoken to a representative XXXX times being ensured XXXX different times that my account will show a XXXX dollar balance on the next billing cycle. They are lying through their teeth and being extremely dishonest.

2023-02-22,"Credit card or prepaid card","Store credit card","Advertising and marketing, including promotional offers","Didn't receive advertised or promotional terms","To Whom It May Concern, I am writing regarding my Gap Rewards Credit Card. I have been a Gap card holder for well over 10 years and the card was always under XXXX. Last year it converted to a Barclays card. I recently have experienced financial hardship and enrolled in a Debt Management Program through XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX sent a proposal to Barclays for both my Gap rewards card and my Banana Republic card. The proposal was to lower the interest rate from 29.99 % to 5.4 % and would have me pay off my balance in 4.5 years. In addition to this arrangement XXXX advised me to close the accounts, which I did. Barclays accepted the proposal for the Banana Republic card, however rejected the proposal for the Gap card. When XXXX as well as myself contacted Barclays to inquire the reason, we were told that I had a promotional interest rate on the account of 0 % until XX/XX/XXXX. I found this odd because all of my statements show that I am in fact paying 29.99 % interest. Upon further explanation, I was informed that the 0 % promotion only applies to purchases made between XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. Which total {$390.00}. My current balance on the card is {$7500.00} and that is being paid at a 29.99 % interest rate. I asked if there was a way to remove the promotion so that I may enroll in the program. I was told no. I asked multiple times if I could pay the {$390.00} over and beyond my minimum payment in order to make the promotional balance XXXX, so that I may enter the program. I was told no. In fact, 3 different representatives told myself and XXXX, that any payment above the minimum payment would be spread out among the balance and NOT directed specifically to the 0 % promotion. This means that I am in fact NOT paying 0 % on the {$390.00}. Barclays is not offering me any way to take advantage of this promotion by allowing me to pay it off prior to XX/XX/XXXX. The only way to pay off the {$390.00} is the pay the entire balance of {$7500.00}. This is unfair. XXXX stated that they have never heard of a creditor doing this and it is false advertising. I would dare say its predatory lending. They offered a promotion before the holidays offering 0 % interest on new purchases however never created a way for me to actually pay off that balance. If I go to XXXX and buy furniture for 0 % interest for 6 months, they absolutely allow me to direct funds ( over and beyond my minimum payment ) to the balance of that furniture. Why is there no way through this promotion, to get out of it? How do I ensure that I am paying 0 % if you will not allow me to pay the {$390.00} prior to XXXX? Lastly and additionally predatory, is that because of this promotion on {$390.00}, Barclays will not allow me to enter a program to address the 29.99 % interest on {$7000.00} balance. They are essentially tying me into this rate and payments for 6 more months. There is no way out. That is not a promotion and I spoke to 7 different representatives yesterday who all claimed there was nothing they could do. This is unacceptable. I am asking for the promotion to either be removed from my account, or for the opportunity to pay off the promotional balance of {$390.00} so as to not accrue any interest, which is how a true promotion is supposed to operate.

This, and the supporting documents ( enclosed ) were sent as a last resort in a certified letter on XX/XX/XXXX, return receipt requested. I do have proof of said delivery ( also in the attached documents ) yet nobody has reached out to resolve this. Here is the sequence of events as laid out to Barclays ( for the seventh time )... 

******************************************************* XX/XX/XXXX Per accounts ending in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX To Whom it May Concern, This is my final attempt to resolve an issue for which Ive now clocked over a dozen hours over the last year and spoken with your resolution team at least five times. 

In each case, I was assured by the agent with whom I spoke that the issue was understood to be an error on your part, and that a correction would be made both to my account and to my credit score, which youve been damaging over the last year. 

Here is the history of this issue, laid out as clearly as I have done with several of your agents, all of whom promised to resolve it, though followed by the same form letter Ive received from you after each attempt at resolution ; see attached. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I became aware that someone had opened an account in my name, ending in XXXX. This card was not opened by me, and there were no valid charges to it. Your investigators acknowledged my lack of culpability in letters dated XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ; see enclosed. 

XX/XX/XXXX : The identity thief, becoming aware of the investigation, opened another account in my name ending in XXXX. None of the data used for that card was accurate, as the perpetrator claimed the new card was because of fraud, and you issued them that card with billing to another address, email, etc not mine. 

XXXX XXXX : After becoming aware of damage to my credit history, I contacted your company four more times, and in each case was told that the balance on XXXX represented late fees and penalties carried over from the previous fraudulent account, XXXX, which you closed after investigation, and relieved me of responsibility for any charges. Therefore, all the charges on XXXX should have likewise been erased from my history, yet you continued to : 1. Bill me monthly ( although I was unaware of this as the bills went to a different address ) XXXX. Hold me responsible for fees associated with fraudulent activity on the previous card XXXX. Report me to the credit bureau Ive enclosed a couple of the letters, all identical, in which you ignore the verbal resolution I got from your customer service team and continue to justify your position that the information is accurate. 

These are clearly form letters which speak to your not taking our communication seriously. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I receive my first statement in a year for an AA Advantage card ending in XXXX. I never had a card with that number, and in reading the statement, its clear that youve been deducting charges from its balance for well over a year. I can only surmise that this card is yet another incarnation of the original one, with all its charges being associated with purchases I never made. This statement is enclosed, and again, its not mine. 

What needs to happen now : XXXX. I need a retraction to your 5+ form letters ignoring verbal resolutions from your staff XXXX. I need proof that youve reported your error to XXXX and repaired my credit XXXX. I need an apology for the stress and time youve cost me over the last nine months. 

What happens if this isnt resolved in the next 30 days : XXXX. I will be in touch with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to file a formal complaint. 
XXXX. I will speak with my attorney about possible civil litigation against your bank. 

I trust that my frustration as well as my intention to get satisfaction have now been clearly communicated. I await your timely reply and the final resolution of this remarkably mismanaged issue.

2023-04-12,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Credit reporting","Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem","Their investigation did not fix an error on your report","To Whom It May Concern : I am writing to vehemently dispute the charged-off account and inaccurate reporting associated with the above-referenced account number XXXX as reported by Barclays Bank DE. Upon reviewing my credit report, I discovered that the account was reported as charged off, which needs to be corrected. 


It should be noted that the account in question was included in a XXXX XXXX bankruptcy filing ; however, the focus of this dispute is not related to the bankruptcy itself. 


I vehemently dispute the accuracy of the charged-off account and assert that the reporting is fundamentally flawed. 

Barclays Bank DE effectively exploits public tax dollars to assist with the write-off by taking a write-off for the previous debt. This action constitutes a form of public assistance. Moreover, my requirement to file the discharged debt as income on my tax return falls under the income statute, which should exempt this debt from being reported on my credit report. 


In addition, I have yet to receive Form 1099-C ( Cancellation of Debt ) from Barclays Bank DE XXXX which contravenes the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) regulations under section 6050P of the Internal Revenue Code. Regardless, I have dutifully filed the discharged debt as income on my tax return, as mandated by the IRS. Barclays Bank DE failure to provide the 1099-C constitutes a breach of the IRS tax code, and it has come to my attention that you have taken a write-off for the debt in question. 


It is crucial to emphasize that income is not required to be reported on a consumer report under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Section 605 ( a ) ( 4 ) of the FCRA explicitly states that consumer reporting agencies may not include any information in a consumer report that pertains to """" receipt of public assistance benefits. '' I assert that the income reported on my tax return, which encompasses the discharged debt, qualifies as public assistance benefits and is therefore exempt from reporting on my consumer report.

I demand that you provide documentation supporting the validity and accuracy of the reported information, including any signed agreements that establish the debt and any other pertinent information. 

I insist that you investigate this matter and verify the following : 1. The accurate reporting of the charged-off account on my credit report, considering that I have filed the discharged debt as income on my tax return despite not receiving a 1099-C from Barclays Bank DE 2 .

3. The validity of the reporting of the charged-off account. 

Should the investigation reveal inaccuracies in reporting the charged-off account, I expect you to remove the account promptly. 

I request that you provide me with the 1099-C you neglected to issue, as required by the IRS regulations XXXX 

I demand that you respond to this dispute within 30 days, as mandated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Failure to comply may result in further actions, including filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and seeking legal counsel. 

I await your prompt attention to this matter.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","IL","60148","","Consent provided","Web",2023-04-12,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6828831,2023

I realized just as I hit submit that the site looked off and struck me as a possible fraudulent site where they steal your numbers and info. I elected to go to my credit card 's account and lock that card to keep it from being used in case of a fraudulent charge. It stated that when I locked it if it were to be used they would notify me. They did not. It was used, but they just removed the charge and didn't allow it to post. I happened to see it because I monitor my accounts daily. I reached out to them and confirmed the charge did indeed happen and it was on the locked card. I then filled out the fraud form so they could cancel the card that had been compromised and send a new one. Except what they sent was a letter for me to call them. So I called them XX/XX/2023. They told me they would have to call me to prove I was me. But they did not call my cell phone that is on the account. They called my spouse 's which is the secondary. They did not answer as their job does not allow them their phones while working. So they told me I had to answer public questions. They asked me what the nearest cross roads were to my home, but refused to explain if a T was considered a crossroad for them so I named XXXX XXXX within a mile radius to my home, but none of them were correct apparently. They then asked me to name the creek that flows near my home. There are 2. One crosses my property in the back and the other is to the west and I cross it when driving. I asked which one. They did not answer me and honestly I've never seen a name for either nor have I heard them called anything other than the creek on XXXX XXXX. The one on my property has never been talked about. I had to look up the plat info for the county to find the name for them. So then they tell me I have to provide to them my DL front & back. My utility bill in my name mailed to my address. None are, all are in email format and it is just an amount and due date. Everything is on auto bill pay from my bank. I explained that I don't get any utility bills mailed to me and most are in my spouses name as they pay the bills. I was told so sad too bad, they are shutting down my account because they suspect fraud and I must send them this information. I also must send them a copy of my bank statement which includes account numbers for accounts I have paid. I also am being required to send them a copy of my social security card front and back. I responded to a letter they sent, but I honestly feel like they are trying to steal my identity. I've had my XXXX card number stolen by a teen at the pizza shop and fraudulently used. I was never treated like this. They verified through information they had on file or that was in my credit report and sent a new card. I am seriously scared to death to mail all those items through the mail to them as my identity could easily be stolen then. And they refuse to speak to me to clear up whatever they think has happened with my card even though I am the one that took steps to ensure that the card was locked and not able to be used fraudulently. But now I'm being punished. They have even locked me out of my online account and I literally can't even pay the last bill as I pay it online.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","KS","664XX","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2023-01-28,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6494064,2023

I did not realize this was happening for a long time, as the charges occur just one day apart- on the XXXX AND XXXX of each month. 

Upon realizing this, I called XXXX thinking it would be a simple solution and that they would refund me for the duplicate, secondary charge which I did not receive secondary CarePass benefits for. However, they do not show two charges or two accounts, so wouldnt do anything to stop the duplicate charge. Their records only show that they are charging me once/month instead of twice/month - therefore, they say they can't do anything to stop the second charge. Guess what? I can't either, because XXXX won't stop the charge and Barclays also will not help me stop the charge. 

After multiple frustrating phone calls with XXXX customer service, I went to my credit card company, Barclays. They told me to work with the merchant, but as mentioned the customer service team at XXXX is not able to accommodate. 

At the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX, I cancelled my XXXX XXXX account all together in hopes of stopping the duplicate charges. On XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, I was once again charged two {$5.00} XXXX fees- even after cancelling the service. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I once again called XXXX to try to get to the bottom of this once and for all. For 40 minutes, I was told that they dont show a XXXX account associated with my credit card. Upon threatening a class action law suit, my account was miraculously found. Only one account was found, however, and the second charge remains a mystery to them.

I dont know why the one account was found and still showing as active, as like I said above, I cancelled the account at the beginning of XXXX ( and can provide the email confirmation ). 

Ive been told that one account has been cancelled and a ticket has been submitted to determine the other account. 

While it would be great to be refunded for the second, duplicate {$5.00} charge Ive been receiving for XXXX years, I would settle at this point for XXXX  to just stop charging my credit card each month so I can stop dealing with this headache with XXXX  and Barclays. 

Since XXXX and Barclays both will not help me resolve this issue, I was forced to close my Barclays credit card which I have had for 12 years and my credit will ultimately suffer because of this. 

I've called Barclays, sent letters, asked to speak to someone outside of a call center, submitted forms online, etc. Only some of the fraudulent charges have been refunded and each month I deal with this because they won't stop XXXX from charging my card. 

I should not have to cancel my credit card because a merchant is wrongly charging my card.

Despite numerous attempts to resolve these matters directly with the company, I have not received satisfactory responses or resolutions. I believe these actions are clear breaches of the CFPB rules and warrant your attention and intervention.

Lack of Communication and Failure to Confirm Debt : The credit card company 's persistent failure to provide me with detailed information regarding the amounts owed and the specific transactions associated with my account constitutes a violation of Regulation Z ( 12 CFR 1026 ), which mandates clear and accurate disclosure of account information and transaction details to consumers.

Delayed Fraud Investigation and Withheld Transaction Details : The credit card company 's unjustifiably long delay in completing the fraud investigation, coupled with their refusal to provide me with comprehensive information regarding the disputed transactions, violates Regulation E ( 12 CFR 1005 ), which establishes consumer rights and protections in electronic fund transfers, including timely investigation and provision of transaction details.

Charging Interest on Outstanding Balance During Fraud Investigation : The credit card company 's practice of charging interest on the outstanding balance while the fraudulent charges were under investigation is a violation of Regulation Z ( 12 CFR 1026 ), which prohibits unfair billing practices, specifically charging interest on disputed amounts during the investigation period.

Failure to Provide Cardholder Agreement : The credit card company 's repeated failure to provide a copy of the cardholder agreement, despite my requests, is in violation of Regulation Z ( 12 CFR 1026 ), which mandates that consumers be provided with a written agreement containing the terms and conditions governing their credit card usage.

Premature Collection Attempts before Initiating Fraud Investigation : The credit card company 's initiation of collection actions against me prior to initiating the fraud investigation violates Regulation F ( 12 CFR 1006 ), which establishes fair debt collection practices, specifically prohibiting collection activities without first conducting a reasonable investigation into the disputed charges.

I have made multiple attempts to address these concerns directly with the credit card company, but their responses have been unsatisfactory, dismissive, or nonexistent. I have diligently maintained records of all communication and correspondences, which I am willing to provide as evidence to support my complaint.

Given the severity and prolonged nature of these violations, I kindly request your immediate intervention and assistance in resolving this matter in accordance with the applicable consumer protection regulations outlined by the CFPB. I believe that the credit card company 's actions have clearly violated these regulations, and I seek your support in ensuring a fair and just resolution.

I would appreciate it if you could investigate this complaint thoroughly, take appropriate actions against the credit card company for their violations, and help secure a resolution that upholds consumer rights and protects my interests. If additional information or documentation is required to facilitate this process, please do not hesitate to contact me at the provided contact details. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to a prompt resolution.

2023-02-16,"Debt collection","Credit card debt","Attempts to collect debt not owed","Debt is not yours","I called Barclays Bank regarding a GAP store card on XX/XX/XXXX. I had received a letter from Barclays stating that I could call to remove myself as an Authorized user that I was an account on that was closed. 

While on the phone with the initial Barclays rep, I made my intentions known and was told that I needed to be transferred to another department because of the account status. 

I was then transferred to a man and I immediately let my intentions be known again I am trying to remove myself as an authorized user he told me that since I was not the account owner, I needed to call him back with the account holder present and gave me a phone number so that he could assist me. He never said that he didnt have the ability to remove me as authorized user when those were clear stated intentions. I had also already given the last four of the social/DOB/phone numbers to the Barclays automated service and the initial rep. 


I called back the next day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and spoke to another woman and again told her my intentions, I spoke to XXXX XXXX yesterday and he said I could call back with the account holder so I could remove myself as an authorized user the lady then proceeded to get everything from the account holder such as birthday, full address, and phone number. The lady then asked if it was okay to call me in 7 days and I asked what would you need to be calling me for and she said things regarding payment she then proceeded to go over account balance etc. etc. 

I asked her, I do not need the account balance, I am calling to remove myself as an authorized user which I clearly stated to XXXX XXXX the day before and to her as soon as I got on the phone. She then stated, after she had the account holder verify her info, that she couldnt remove me as an authorized user. 

I was then escalated to another woman for the same company who was apart of claims/complaints and she stated that XXXX XXXX nor the lady I spoke to previously said that they could remove me as an authorized user. I stated to her that those were my intentions immediately getting on the phone and that could have been said to me right away. I would not have had the account holder verify any information. The account holder is a senior citizen and can easily be taken advantage of. 

I feel as though I was mislead into believing they could remove me as an authorized user as on XX/XX/XXXX, I was led to believe I was still talking to a Barclays/GAP representative XXXX I was transferred internally to my knowledge. The lady I was escalated to on XX/XX/XXXX replayed the phone conversation at my request as I claimed that XXXX XXXX did not state who he was or who he worked for when I was transferred to him on XX/XX/XXXX, he did not state his name in the beginning nor did he say his company he was affiliated with nor did he say he was attempting to collect a debt. Somehow, in the phone conversation she replayed, he magically said all this at the beginning. It is simply untrue and when she replayed the call for me, the beginning part sounded muffled and then magically when I started speaking, it went to normal. I truly believe they played a recording of XXXX XXXX voice and then started playing our actual conversation. I remember feeling confused when I dialed the number XXXX XXXX gave me because of the intro for XXXX XXXX  when I was expecting it to be Barclays. He absolutely did not state he was from that company when I spoke to him. I believe the deceptively incorporated that into the playback. The lady I was escalated too actually said that she would need to hang up with me to find the call and then call me back, which she did. Somehow when I asked her to play the recording from XX/XX/XXXX of her co-worker that I had just spoken to before I spoke to her, she was able to find it almost immediately while I was still on the phone but had to hang up and call me back to find the conversation I had with XXXX XXXX. 

I feel they had two opportunities to tell me I was not able to removed as an authorized user by them but failed to do so. I was only told this information after the account holder essentially verified the debt and even then after she finished answering the questions to verify, the lady immediately went into account balance completely ignoring my intentions for calling in the first place. I had to bring it up again myself and THEN she said that she could not remove me. 

I ended up calling back Barclays and asking to speak to a supervisor who eventually removed me as an authorized user but feel mislead by Barclays too as they did not state they were transferring me to an external collection agency during my initial call on XX/XX/XXXX. I was able to get recordings of phone conversations today of my interactions. 

I feel I was extremely mislead and straight up lied to by XXXX XXXX XXXX. They deceptively got me to verify a debt and now I know they will be hounding the phone number provided to them, they have my phone number as well as the lady I spoke with called it back to me. I have nothing to do with this account. 

I got a couple of operator IDs from Barclays and the supervisor, named XXXX went back and forth whether or not one of them was XXXX XXXX. The numbers she gave me were : XXXX ( or possibly XXXX ) & XXXX. I also filed a complaint with Barclays while on the phone with XXXX detailing my experience and she assigned me the ComplaintID of : XXXX. 

I will attach the letter from Barclays saying that I needed to call their customer service to remove myself as an XXXX. I also have phone conversations recorded that I can provide if necessary as I can not upload them here.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","TX","75002","","Consent provided","Web",2023-02-16,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6573550,2023

As I stated to them I would never put myself in a position to be giving out information over the phone or online that could be used to take all the money that I have. I have never been asked by any other organization or payment that I make including my credit card for banking and routing information. I tried to rectify the situation with Old Navy and they were very clear that there are no other options it is now the XXXX of XXXX and my payment is due by the XXXX. I asked each person very respectfully how I was expected to make a payment to them if they only will allow you to do so by giving out your personal information in an unsecure way and I was told basically that was it too bad. I reported his to the XXXX XXXX XXXX  over the phone and was given a number for headquarters of Old Navy. When I called I was transferred right back to the customer service solution center where I got nowhere. I also was told I was going to receive the ability to file a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX through paperwork from an email that I never received. I called the XXXX XXXX XXXX  back so let them know I had not received the email and that the number they had given was for customer service just so they were informed. I was told they had never heard of anything like this it seemed very sketchy so to speak and to report it now to this organization. Let it be known that I'm just trying to make the payment and at this point I would cancel the account because I do not agree with this business practice at all. Having signed up for the account in the first place to try to build my credit is actually going to have the opposite effect because I have no choice but to close the account not being able to make the payment in a way that feels safe. I have now spoke to two unidentified people that I've told me that they had been drawn into the same what seems like scam with Old Navy and that there was no way for them to get out of it either other than to wait until their account was in default and try to call and speak to somebody to close that account but then still ended up with the bill that they weren't able to pay and less giving banking information, and that it went against their credit. This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. I also was not able to locate any place on the website to file a complaint other than links that took me to the same phone numbers that lead to customer service. Not being able to file a complaint and itself is a sketchy practice let alone putting yourself in a situation as a customer where you could have your total bank account wiped out.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","OH","437XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-08-01,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7216549,2023

2023-04-11,"Debt collection","Credit card debt","False statements or representation","Attempted to collect wrong amount","I bought 8 phones from XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX has claimed they never received 3 out of the 8 phones I sent back for returns. XXXX refused to help me for the three missing phones, so I got my Barclay 's Bank involved. I have been dealing with these cases since XX/XX/XXXX. My case IDs with Barclays are the following : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. Barclay 's closed my case XXXX without notice or reason on XX/XX/XXXX with no manager callback as requested. I have provided evidence with tracking numbers of all the phones that were returned back to XXXX and signed for, but the bank keeps closing my case without explanation & warning. 

4 separate transactions were made to the XXXX XXXX. Each phone cost {$470.00}. I bought two phones each on these dates : XX/XX/XXXX ( Order ID : XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX ( order ID : XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX ( Order ID : XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) Four transactions of XXXX because 2 phones were bought within each transaction. 

I only won 1 case with Barclay 's for the total amount of one phone ( XXXX ) but they refuse to refund the last XXXX because they saw a refund from XXXX that did not pertain to the correct transaction. They failed to see that I ordered eight phones in total but I have all documentation which phone was refunded and which phones were not refunded. 

The phones that were NEVER refunded to XXXX were the following : Phone 4XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Unlocked ) - NO REFUND, DELIVERED ON XX/XX/XXXX XXXX # : XXXX / XXXX  : XXXX Tracking ID XXXX  : XXXX Phone 5XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Unlocked ) - NO REFUND, DELIVERED ON XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX # : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Tracking ID XXXX  : XXXX Phone 8 - XXXX  XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  ( Unlocked ) - NO REFUND, DELIVERED ON XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX # : XXXX / XXXX  : XXXX Tracking ID XXXX  : XXXX Barclay 's keeps closing my case without reason and the agents keep telling me different information saying a manager will follow up with me, but no manager calls me back and they change their story saying I missed the deadline to submit more evidence. The last time I submitted my evidence was XX/XX/XXXX and the Manager, XXXX, told me to call back on XX/XX/XXXX. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX but no manager had followed up with me & blamed their faulty server for not calling me back. They claim to have no record of a manager call back even though I have the exact call log on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX & the case ID for a manager 's call back - # XXXX. I waited until Monday XX/XX/XXXX for the final callback, with no callback. So I reopened the case to have a manager call me back. I called back today, XX/XX/XXXX and the representatives claim there was no case opened for a manager call back. 

The resolution I want is my {$950.00} returned back to my credit card. Please note all tracking numbers for all 8 phones. If I was refunded for a phone, I do note that I was refunded. Since Barclay 's only got back one phone cost ( {$470.00} ), the remaining cost would be XXXX ( the other two phones XXXX has lost, themselves ). 


Here is a summary of all phones and their tracking numbers. If a phone was not refunded, it will say so. I have also attached a PDF of this letter.

My XX/XX/XXXX statement shows {$900.00} added back to my balance listed as """" Adjustment-Payments ''. I called the company and spoke to a customer service rep who seemed very confused and stated I should call back if the issue did not resolve in the next billing cycle. The next day I spoke to a more helpful rep who agreed the Adjust-Payments charge looked odd and opened a case ( XXXX XXXX ) on my behalf. She informed me it could take up to two billing cycles to correct the issue. I received a letter in the mail from Barclay 's Gapcard dated XX/XX/XXXX referencing my case number.

Old Navy never applied my payment and continued to withdraw my automatic payment of {$38.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$39.00} on XXXX XXXX and {$38.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I did not realize additional payments were being taken out until after the payment made in XXXX as they were set up on automatic payments through Old Navy 's payment site. Once I realized this I called Old Navy  Barclays on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about the payments and understand why they were still showing a balance on my account when I had paid the account in full in XXXXBarclays stated that they did not see my applied payment in XXXX and that I would have to call XXXX instead as my account had just been transferred to them and they did not have the XXXX information. I called XXXX, explained that I was trying to figure out why my payment was not applied and they gave me a similar excuse. They had transferred their records to Barclays and no longer had my account information. XXXX advised me to call Barclays even though I'd explained that I'd spoken with Barclays and they'd insisted that I resolve the matter with XXXX. I called Barclay'sagain on XX/XX/XXXX to seek a resolution and they were still attempting to reroute me to XXXX for help. After being bounced from department to department, I finally spoke to the payment resolutions department at Barclays who opened a case on my behalf. I received a letter in the mail about a week and half later requesting I send proof of payment from my bank. I downloaded the information and mailed the proof of payment back to Barclays. XX/XX/XXXX arrived and I had not heard anything from Barclay'sregarding my case but received a call saying I had an overdue payment. I attempted to speak to someone about my case but the only information they had for me was that the claim was closed due to my proof of payment not being sufficient. On XX/XX/XXXX, a woman named XXXX called me from the resolution department and I explained all of the back and forth I had gone thru but had received no resolution and still no one could track down why my payment had not been applied and why the proof of payment I received directly from my bank was insufficient. XXXX assured me that she would research and try to resolve it. She gave me an email address to send my proof of payment to again. I sent the information only to have the email come back saying the email address was invalid. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Barclays once again to check on the status of my claim and was advised that the XXXX payment of {$1100.00} was applied to my account but then said the payment was returned to me.

I have been trying for nearly 2 months now to get this resolved but no one has been able to help me. I'm extremely tired of the runaround and want this resolved. 

Barclays responded to my prior CFPB complaint, issued a credit to resolve on XX/XX/XXXX, sent me a refund check for my overpayment and now in XX/XX/XXXX took away the credit and is calling me about being late again.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","TX","76227","","Consent provided","Web",2023-01-31,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6509922,2023

I am writing to express my disappointment and concern regarding the recent decline of my credit card application with your esteemed institution. I believe that my application was unjustly rejected, and I would like to bring to your attention a potential violation of consumer law. As a responsible individual, I have maintained a good credit history and have promptly met all my financial obligations. Therefore, I was surprised to receive a notification stating that my application for a credit card had been declined. I followed the necessary steps, provided all the required documentation, and fulfilled the eligibility criteria outlined by your bank. Upon reviewing the reasons for the credit card decline, I was dismayed to find that the decision was based on discriminatory grounds, which is in violation of consumer protection laws. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) prohibits creditors from denying credit to individuals based on factors such as race, color, religion, national origin, XXXX, marital status, age, or receipt of public assistance. I firmly believe that my application was declined due to factors unrelated to my creditworthiness, but rather due to unlawful discrimination. I kindly request that you provide me with a detailed explanation for the denial of my credit card application, specifically addressing any potential violation of consumer protection laws. I also urge you to reconsider your decision and reassess my application based solely on my creditworthiness and financial history, as is required by law. If it is determined that my application was indeed declined in violation of consumer protection laws, I expect appropriate action to be taken to rectify the situation. This may include providing me with the opportunity to reapply for the credit card or offering suitable compensation for the inconvenience caused. I would like to remind you that as a consumer, I am aware of my rights and will not hesitate to seek legal recourse or report this matter to the relevant regulatory authorities if necessary. I trust that your esteemed institution values its reputation for fair and ethical practices and will take the appropriate steps to address this issue in a timely and satisfactory manner. I kindly request a prompt response within [ a reasonable timeframe, e.g., 14 days ] from the date of receipt of this letter. You may reach me at the contact details provided above. I would appreciate your attention to this matter and a swift resolution. Thank you for your immediate attention to this serious concern. I look forward to your prompt response.

However, the 2nd check # XXXX was processed on XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX for {$14000.00} was marked in Barclays statement as check # XXXX instead of # XXXX. Because of that Barclay started charging me interest of 20.24 %. When I caught this issue I called Barclays to resolve the issue hoping to reverse all interest charges. The 1st call I made XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX with ID : XXXX XXXX created the case # XXXX to have the problem to resolved ASAP.

After I had signed all of the paperwork at the rental office she refused to provide me with a copy of the rental agreement. 
This included the paperwork where I would highlight damage to the vehicle. I asked twice in front of 3 colleagues. She refused and said it was not necessary. She told us the keys were in the vehicle and gave us a small card with the vehicles location in the parking garage. When we checked the vehicle out there was no one there to greet us or go over any prior scratches to the vehicle. As the vehicle was already covered with general wear and tear scratches we took a video of the vehicle and left the garage. The small scratches were already there. 
When I returned to drop the car off the following day I asked the attendant to check us in. He said that we were good to go and kept directing traffic. We took a video and left. 
After returning home I found a charge of {$570.00} on my credit card. I called my credit card company and XXXX XXXX XXXX case # XXXX. 
After leaving a review that XXXX directed me to I received an email the following day stating that the damages have increased to XXXX Euros and to transfer the money to their bank account. 

On XX/XX/2023 I returned to XXXX, XXXX and went directly to the XXXX XXXX XXXX and asked for a manager. I showed them the paperwork that I was emailed. XXXX employees XXXX and XXXX were able to produce timestamped photos every time a car leaves or returns to the parking garage.

XXXX XXXX stamped and signed the picture. She printed an itemized bill in XXXX showing damages charged and a total. 

I contacted Barclaycard several times regarding this matter, specifically on XX/XX/2023 to report it. My case was closed 45 minutes after I opened it. I contacted them the following week and was told to FAX in a VIDEO of the car. I was told to submit all documentation through fax or through the US Mail. This would take longer than 45 minutes to resolve. After flying back to XXXX I faxed 20 pages showing the itemized receipt, timestamped photographs, and the email from the XXXX Manager in XXXX.

At this point I am very upset and i told them to close the account because I don't want anything to do with them. They said they closed the account and will remove the annual fee and also said they'll notify the credit bureaus, and that I have nothing to worry about and how this is their fault, as well as reverting that late and all will go back to normal. The whole point in which why a late was put was because it was their fault claiming I couldn't pay the fee. As I said once already, I HAVE NO ACCESS TO THIS ACCOUNT.

I don't use this credit card very often and was very surprised to see a personal email saying my account was seriously past due. I don't use my personal email very often. This credit card was supposed to be set to paper statements. I have had great difficulty trying to access this account online and finding someone to talk with when I call the help line.

My reply was that I had had a credit score of almost XXXX, with a very strong payment history with everyone. 

I'm attaching the statement for period XXXX. I don't believe I received this account statement, so responded with full payment when I noticed the """" You are seriously past due '' in an email. Each of the last two statements charge {$30.00} or {$40.00} + interest on very small balances. My credit history has been very adversely affected. 

I'm really hoping you can help. I have other credit card statements, but I'm concerned that other people are also receiving this bad treatment.

In conversations on XX/XX/, a representative of AA  related to the XXXX charge told me that there was some sort of error processing this charge to my primary card, so the charge went through my XXXX XXXX to charge this card because it was somehow associated with the business ecosystem of the card. They informed me that they do not know what the error with my XXXX card ( my primary card ) was and can not explain, but they are happy to move the charge over to that card. I explained to them that the damage had already been done and that this had caused a very grave impact to my credit score. They told me to let them know how they could help. Please let me know if you would be willing to speak with XXXX XXXX. 

Second, because I was unaware of the charge being made to this card, I didnt make any attempts to pay the amount, but as a backup measure, I felt assured that my auto-pay function would pay off any charges that did happen to hit my account including perhaps random fees or errors. In my initial conversation with representatives about this issue, I was told that they could not figure out when I called in to set up my auto-pay because they could only see an online payment for my first card payment. I went through my phone records and found what I believe to be the call where I set up autopay on XX/XX/XXXX 

Third, given that autopay was either not completely set up or not set up at all, no payment was made. Over the next 30 days, I do not believe any attempts were made to contact me. In my phone records which I sent them, one can clearly see there are no calls made from the number I was told by the Barclays agent that I would have received a call from ( number here ). Furthermore, I was also told that my e-mail address had been mistyped by Barclays representatives as XXXX instead of the correct XXXX, so any email notification that was sent was ultimately sent to the wrong address. I did previously receive many marketing emails to the correct email address as late as XX/XX/ and now that my email address has been corrected, I am again receiving updates, but for the critical period in question, I received no account-related updates. 

Had these errors not been made OR had a notification been sent to my phone or any kind of text message, I would have known the charge had been made and not paid. 

Fourth, upon finding out that this money was unpaid through a flag in a credit monitoring app ( XXXX XXXX ), I paid it within 3 minutes, hoping that both Barclays and the credit bureaus could see that this was all related to errors as opposed to non-payment, however apparently I was too late.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","TX","78741","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-12,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7979139,2023

XXXX XXXX provided me with a document showing the check was reconciled by Barclays on XX/XX/XXXX. However, the money was never credited to my account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Barclays and reported the issue. I provided them the check amount and number and they started an investigation. On XX/XX/XXXX, the company credited a """" provisional credit payment '' of {$11000.00}. I received a letter stating the investigation did not produce the check in question so they put the {$11000.00} back onto my account on XX/XX/XXXX. This is reflected on my XX/XX/XXXX statement. On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out again to Barclays and they asked that I fax a copy of the check to them. I did so and they money was credited back to my account. The issue is, I was still charged with late fees for the several months the check was pending. Also, my current amount due for a minimum payment {$670.00} with {$540.00} past due. I called them several times to have the payment amount adjusted to reflect the current balance on the card and also to make the appropriate credits towards any interest and late fees incurred due to the extended timeframe they could not locate the check. They continue to tell me that the balance due is """" computer generated '' and they refuse to change it. So, my account has been locked and the company continues to call me to harass me by phone, along with continuing to add late fees onto my balance. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a response from XXXX at Barclays ( letter attached ) stating that the reason for the lost check was because I did not have the full account number on the check. Therefore, it was reconciled but was not added to my account. To clarify any confusion, as I stated in my original complaint, I was not the person who mailed the check to Barclays. Since this payment was part of a debt consolidation loan, XXXX XXXX XXXX mailed the check directly to Barclays. It is their policy. When I received this response from Barclays, I immediately called XXXX XXXX XXXX to notify them of this response and attempt to fix the issue. I showed them the response from Barclays. The credit union stated that they did not write the account number on the check because they included a copy of the most recent statement that I had sent to them when I was applying for the loan. I also attached a signed letterhead from the loan processor indicating they included the statement in the envelope with the check.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","NC","27405","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2023-08-08,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7370910,2023

Comany response is completely insufficient. Not only have I not yet received a credit for the original {$1000.00} theft from my account, the company failed to acknowledge the interest acrrued on said account ( ~ {$350.00} ). The company also provided a very weak apology and did not account for what happened as well as how they will avoid this problem with others in the future. 

Barclays flat out lied to me on several occaassions regarding this theft. I expect to be compensated for the time I spend dealing with this issue, the original {$1000.00} theft and all interest accrued to my account. I also expect a detailed explanation as to why I was continuously lied to and how they will prevent this from happening in the future. If I didn't have the means and technology ( as well as locating receipts, which was no small matter ) to continue pursuit of this XXXX job in retreiving my money, they would have gotten away with literally stealing from me.

I then notified the merchant via email at XXXXcst on XX/XX/23, that because they had not delivered the services I purchased, I would need to be refunded for my purchase. 

Only AFTER I notified Barclays to dispute/cancel the transaction, and AFTER I notified the merchant of my request for refund, did the merchant deliver via email at XXXXcst on XX/XX/23, 3 of the 5 items that were part of my order. The other 2 items which were services ( XXXX XXXX & XXXX XXXX XXXX ) were never rendered. Despite this, Barclays sided with the merchant 's No Refund Policy and took the merchant 's screenshot of having delivered via email 3 out of 5 items purchased, as proof that the merchant had fulfilled the entire 5 item order and was due payment. 

Barclays determined that I owed payment to a merchant who did not deliver services, and in doing so violated the Fair Credit Billing Act by : 1. failing to perform a proper investigation ( & not requiring the merchant to provide time stamped proof that file items sent were delivered within agreed upon service time frame, nor confirming the other 2 items comprising my order were actually delivered ) 2. failing to consider the evidence I provided 3. permanently reinstating the charge that was previously removed, 4. refusing to provide an adequate written explanation of its decision and supporting documents to justify the reinstated charge, ( the documents Barclays provided me with from the merchant were screenshots that did not accurately display a chronological timeline of correspondence, nor did the screenshots show messages in full ) 5. continuing to demand payment of the charge and associated interest and fees. 

On XX/XX/23 I uploaded a pdf of my email correspondence with the merchant to my Barclays customer account portal for review, per the Dispute Team 's request. Had this actually been read and reviewed Barclays Dispute Team would have seen first hand the merchant 's deceptive business practices and realized that I had been scammed. Instead, Barclays sided with the merchant. 

I made multiple phone calls to Barclays between XXXX and XXXX explaining to Customer Service Reps the situation and detailing what happened with this merchant/transaction, and each time was told that my case would be reviewed again. I was told that given the details I should not owe payment for services I did not receive, or for items that were delivered after I canceled the transaction, despite previous rulings by the Dispute Team. 

On XX/XX/23 I faxed a pdf of my correspondence with the merchant and highlighted timestamps to ( XXXX ) XXXX, a fax number provided to me by a Customer Service Rep. When I called back several days later to check the investigation/receipt status, I was told the Dispute Team did not know where or if my documents had been received. Another fax number was provided to me as a result. 

On XX/XX/23 I faxed a pdf of my correspondence with the merchant this time with both highlighted timestamps and commentary annotations to ( XXXX ) XXXX. I also faxed a screenshot of my XXXX phone record from XX/XX/23 showing my phone call to Barclays Customer Service at XXXXcst, as proof that I canceled the transaction BEFORE the merchant emailed 3 of the 5 items I purchased later that evening at XXXXcst. My timestamped/highlighted pdf showed the merchant sent these items at XXXX/cst on XX/XX/23, and that the other 2 services comprising my order had not been rendered. 

Despite all of this, Barclays still determined that the merchant did not violate their No Refund Policy because """" they fulfilled services '' and were owed payment. Barclays also advised - in no uncertain terms - that to be refunded, I would need to work with the merchant who, based on the evidence I provided, had so obviously scammed me.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","TX","761XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-09,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7971657,2023

Thinking my autopay would kick back in. It did not and I was alerted in XXXX that my score had dropped due to a missed payment due to Barclays. I called to inquire why autopay did not take care of the monthly payment due and was informed it had been cancelled. It was then I was told, I should not have cancelled the autopay, that it would not have taken the additional money out if the balance was XXXX. Okay, lesson learned. The rep refunded my late payment and told me to write a letter to the dispute department to see if they could change the information sent to the credit bureau in light of the misunderstanding. I did just that and still have yet to receive a direct response from them concerning the matter. Funny thing is I paid the small balance in full a few days later and earlier than the due date. I left the autopay in place ( as I was instructed I should do ) and guess what? When my due date came along, they charged my account anyway, despite the fact I had a XXXX balance. HMMM!!! To top it off, they decreased my credit limit yet affecting my credit score once again. I felt XXXX valued. As a loyal Barclay 's member, who always pays on time and stays well below my credit limit, this was as isolated incident and XXXX due to an honest misunderstanding.

When it effects my credit score, that's a representation of my worthiness, my ability and willingness to pay my debts. A representation of me that they should not have the ability to affect or manipulate so easily. I am attaching several screen-prints of my credit score across several platforms.

This is now the 4th time I've tried to get this resolved before I contacted a regulator. 

XX/XX/XXXX : fraudulent charge at XXXX on my Barclay arrivals card in amount of {$160.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I logged into my account and noticed this fraudulent transaction notified barclays via customer service, spoke to two people including fraud department, was told there was nothing more I needed to do and transaction would be removed since fraud. 

Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, the fraud transaction posted XX/XX/XXXX. Received letter from barclays it was fraud and I wouldn't be responsible, but still have {$160.00} on my statement.

I tell them it needs removed asap because it's fraud again and I won't pay for something that fraudulent and not sure why they let it post and still haven't removed it when I told them right away.

It is now XX/XX/. In XXXX, someone used my personal information to fraudulently apply for and open an Old Navyist Rewards Credit Card, and then proceeded to make 3 in-store purchases between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX for an amount close to {$1000.00}. I called Barclays, who I guess services the Old Navcyist credit cards, to report the fraud. They gave me no information at that time about what information they needed from me in order to prove that this was fraud ; they simply told me they would investigate. They investigated, and determined it was indeed me who opened the account and made the charges. So I filed a police report, reported the fraud to the credit bureaus, and provided this information through the mail to Barclays. Barclays claimed never to have received the information I mailed to them. So, I faxed it to them. I also sent them copies of time- and location-stamped digital photos showing that I was not in the locations where the purchases were made on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX. I did not have location services turned on on my phone at that time, so I'm not sure how else I can prove that it was not me. They have once again denied my fraud claim and are preparing to send my account to collections. 

This is ridiculous and an insulting waste of my time. My credit history prior to this fraud shows a near-perfect record. I have never opened a rewards credit card of any sort, and though I have made purchases from Old Navy in the past, I have never made a retail clothing purchase for anywhere near the {$700.00} of one of the fraudulent charges that were made to the account. My credit was excellent for my entire adult life until this fraud, and I am outraged. I'm not sure what else I can do to prove that I am not responsible for this account.

Obviously, this was important to me because this put me in a different bracket as far as points on my home loan went. This ending costing me 1 point ( on a {$450000.00} home loan ). 

At this point I'm completely out the missing {$5000.00}, interest, points on mortgage and my credit reports are not correct. 5 payments in the amount of {$1000.00} each were made to XXXX XXXX  ( The same way every via bill-pay from XXXX XXXX  for the past 3 plus years to XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX 

Each payment of {$1000.00} was made was electric from XXXX to XXXX some way for the last 3 years NO changes! It is set-up automatically for weekly payments. I noticed that my payments were not posted, so I called XXXX XXXX  and they stated I did not make the payments. I called XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX  and I called XXXX XXXX  together and once XXXX XXXX  stated the payments were not made. 

XXXX and I both sent back-up 's of the payments totaling over {$5000.00} that are missing and they still state the payments were not made.

2023-10-24,"Credit card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem with a purchase shown on your statement","Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card","I was the victim of credit card fraud on XX/XX/XXXX. I noticed and reported this fraud on XX/XX/XXXX. The fraud was from SQ XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$2200.00}. I was told it would be taken care of. However, I noticed later that no actions were taken to resolve the fraud. I called back. A provisional credit was given in the amount of the fraud while an investigation took place. 

The week of XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Barclays on XX/XX/XXXX stating that they had completed the investigation and the transaction was found to be valid based on """" your previous purchase history with the merchant ''. I called Barclays back on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX in regards to this erroneous claim and stated that if there is previous purchase history with this merchant then there is additional fraud. XXXX confirmed that there was no previous purchase history with this merchant. XXXX also informed me that there was another letter from XX/XX/XXXX currently in route to me that stated that it was in fact found to be fraud and that I would not be responsible for the activity. As previously stated the amount of fraud was {$2200.00}. The amount refunded to me was only {$220.00}. The agent stated that someone seemingly left out the XXXX ', creating a significant accounting error. I was assured that another investigation had been opened and they would work to resolve the error within 30 days. The new case reassertion number was XXXX. 

I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX in regards to an update. She stated there were no updates at this time and I would receive a letter in the mail and she confirmed the 30 day resolution window. 

With only days until a payment is due on the fraudulent amount I called back on day XXXX of the 30 day window. This was XX/XX/XXXX and I spoke to XXXX. She informed me that the credit of {$220.00} came from the vendor, who admitted that it was a fraudulent charge. XXXX told me that she would put a note on my account stating that I would not be liable for interest charges, as it was found to be fraud. She advised me to make the minimum payment to avoid lated fees, XXXX XXXX reduction, etc. Per her advice I set up a minimum payment to go out on the due date of XX/XX/XXXX. She escalated my case since it was 1 day away from the end of the 30 day resolution window. She advised me to call back in XXXX business days for an update. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I missed a call from Barclays. I called them back on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with XXXX. XXXX provided information from documentation from the merchant. XXXX informed me that a letter from Barclays created on XX/XX/XXXX stated that it was not found to be fraud. I have not received this letter. I asked why and XXXX stated because the letter was not mailed until XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX told me that the letter states that the charge was not found to be fraudulent because the merchant was able to provide my name, mailing address and phone number. The merchant was unable to provide my correct email address. The email address provided by the merchant was XXXX. This email is not associated with me in any way. The invoice number from the merchant was # XXXX, which XXXX and I agreed seems suspicious. XXXX confirmed that there are no previous purchases from me with this merchant. She provided the following information about the merchant : Name : XXXX XXXX Design Incorporation Address : XXXX Blue XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX Phone : XXXX XXXX created fraud investigation case stating the following : XXXX was unaware of the transaction -I have no previous business with the merchant -I did not receive goods or services from this merchant -My name/address/phone number are easily accessible online and not sound evidence to claim that it was not fraudulent -The email address provided by the merchant is not my email address -The invoice number of # XXXX is suspicious XXXX said she will also log a complaint about the XXXX of my case as it is has not been handled fairly or in a timely manner and she stated that they can do better. 

I called back on XX/XX/XXXX to confirm Barclay 's mailing address to send them a letter from XXXX. I spoke with XXXX who confirmed the Barclay 's mailing address is po box XXXX, XXXX, DE XXXX. XXXX stated that I will be charged interest until/if the charge is found to be fraud. I asked her to provide the case number created by XXXX this morning and she was unable to find a case number from XX/XX/XXXX. She was however able to find a case number from XX/XX/XXXX. I did not call or speak to anyone on XX/XX/XXXX, but did receive a voicemail asking me to call Barclays back ( which I did this morning when I spoke to XXXX ). The case number created on XX/XX/XXXX is XXXX. I am unsure what that case states as I did not create it. 

This has gone on since XX/XX/XXXX. I've lost sleep over this, I've spent hours on the phone seeking resolution. I feel unsupported by Barclays and I need help.

2023-10-27,"Credit card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Fees or interest","Charged too much interest","Statement dated XX/XX/23 had a balance of {$5100.00} due on XX/XX/23. That statement covered the period XXXX. Before the due date, I made two additional purchases in amount of {$640.00}, which were also paid the same day. I paid off the card in full ( statement balance plus the {$640.00} additional purchases ) on XX/XX/23 and my account reflected a {$0.00}. I then locked my card. I had to make an emergency purchase today ( XX/XX/23 ) and was initially declined and realized I had my card locked, so when I logged on to unlock my card I see a balance of {$83.00} and was confused. I look and see that despite my card being paid in full within the grace period, Barclays was now assessing me interest charges. I have never been assessed charges if balance paid in full or if paid over the minimum balance due ( please refer to prior months statements I am attaching. 

Also according to their own policy in my statement about interest : """" Accrual of Interest and How to Avoid Paying Interest on Purchases. Your due date is at least 23 days after the close of each billing cycle. On Purchases, interest begins to accrue as of the transaction date. However, you can avoid paying interest if you pay your Purchases subject to interest ( excluding XXXX XXXX Offers ) plus any monthly XXXX XXXX Payment Amount in full by the Payment Due Date every month '' They specifically state you can avoid interest if you pay your Purchases in full by Payment Due date. Which I did. 

I am not disputing any month where I was assessed interest and carried a balance ( See XXXX I was assessed {$67.00}, but I also had carried a balance over so that is fine ). I am disputing as I paid in full before due date so was within grace period. And as you can see in prior months I was also not assessed interest even when carrying a balance over. I want the interest reversed as account balance was paid off well within the grace period. They are using deceptive practices and don't even follow a consistent pattern when interest could have been assessed legitimately.

I am writing to request your kind consideration regarding the late payments that are currently being reported on my credit report. I am an account holder with Barclays Bank Delaware, and my account number is XXXX. 

First and foremost, I would like to bring to your attention the unforeseen circumstances that led to the late payments on my account. As you may be aware, the XXXX pandemic has impacted countless individuals worldwide, and I unfortunately fell victim to its effects. I contracted XXXX at the time, which resulted in a severe deterioration of my health. 

Due to the severity of my condition, I was admitted to the hospital for an extended period, during which I was unable to fulfill my financial obligations promptly. Regrettably, this health crisis coincided with an unexpected loss of employment, which further exacerbated my financial difficulties. The combination of medical bills and a sudden loss of income placed an immense burden on me, making it challenging to meet my payment obligations. 

To compound matters, the emotional strain caused by these circumstances took a toll on my personal life as well. Tragically, my beloved dog, who had been my source of comfort during this challenging time, passed away. The emotional devastation and grief from this loss further hindered my ability to manage my affairs effectively, including ensuring my financial responsibilities were met. 

In light of these extraordinary circumstances, I kindly request your reconsideration to update the late payments on my credit report. I understand that your institution has the discretion to make adjustments in situations where customers have faced significant hardships beyond their control. Given the global impact of the XXXX  pandemic, I believe my case aligns with the intent of the Cares Act, which emphasizes relief and assistance to individuals facing financial hardships caused by this unprecedented crisis. 

I kindly request that you update the late payments on my credit report to """" paid as agreed '' to accurately reflect my current financial status. This adjustment would greatly alleviate the negative impact on my creditworthiness and provide a fair representation of my commitment to meeting my financial obligations. 

I am committed to restoring my financial stability and demonstrating responsible financial behavior moving forward. I understand the importance of meeting my payment obligations and intend to make all future payments in a timely manner. 

Thank you for your understanding and consideration in this matter. I sincerely hope that you will grant my request for the adjustment of the late payments on my credit report. I am confident that Barclays Bank Delaware, as a reputable financial institution, values its customers and supports them during times of unforeseen hardship. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and eagerly await your positive response. 

Yours sincerely, XXXX XXXX","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","NV","89129","","Consent provided","Web",2023-05-29,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7041150,2023

The amounts : {$150.00}, {$75.00}, & {$220.00} all showed up on my statement for XX/XX/2023. However the largest amount of {$1300.00} did not. 
I contacted the law firm and was told that the {$1300.00} had been refunded to my card ending in XXXX XXXXXXXX. This was the account I had when the XXXX XXXX was with XXXX XXXX 
I contacted Barclays customer service on XX/XX/2023 to ask about the remaining amount of {$1300.00}. I spoke with XXXX who informed me that since it the refund was issued to my old XXXX XXXX account that I needed to contact them because they """" still had my account information ''. 
I contacted XXXX Bank and let them know about the refund. I spoke with XXXX ( male ) who informed me that all of the account information had passed to Barclays and they did not have access to it anymore. He told me to contact Barclays and to file a dispute because the funds would have automatically transferred over within 30 days. 
I called Barclays back and spoke with XXXX ( female ) that I had spoken with XXXX XXXX and they did not have access to my old account and that I needed to file a dispute. She placed me on hold and asked the receiving department, then informed me that I needed to call XXXX XXXX back and ask for a supervisor because they did have access to my old account. The person they spoke to in receiving said they had access to old accounts that had been transferred. I was told that after I spoke with them ( not before ) I could call them back to file a dispute. 
I called XXXX XXXX back on XX/XX/2023 and was able to speak to the same XXXX who transferred me to his supervisor XXXX. She informed me that they definitely did not have any access to my old account and that I needed to file a dispute. All of the account information was deleted. 
So I called Barclays back and requested the Dispute department ( from call options ). I spoke with XXXX who gave me the fax # and information they needed. 
Attached you will see the letter the mailed me confirming their receipt of the information, and their letter saying they could not resolve it because it had been more than 2 billing cycles. 
I see no point in yelling at them. The law firm should not have been able to issue the refund to a closed account. If it is able to, then the bank should have been able to successfully transfer the {$1300.00} over to my new account ending in XXXX at Barclays without me having to babysit them. I was not informed of the refund to my credit card ( no one else has ever done this, especially after so long ). I found it accidentally when I went to pay my bill more than a month after the transfer. At that point I was travelling with my family during the summer. Once I returned home I had XXXX kids to get ready for school. 
The money transferred to Barclays Bank. They would not let me even speak with their dispute department, and gave inaccurate information to me multiple times about addressing this with XXXX XXXX. The only way there is a limit of 2 billing cycles is if they make one up. They have the money and unless they do not know how to do simple accounting, they can find it and give me the refund they were paid for. 
I have attached proof of the refund from the law firm showing successful. I have also attached my credit card statement showing the other successful refunds, and the fax cover that I sent them with this exact information.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","TX","75032","","Consent provided","Web",2023-10-23,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7746258,2023

Based on what I had been told in early XXXX, when I was on the phone, the representative told me after she had removed the incorrect addresses that my credit score would be XXXX.

I had no idea that the interest was still running. According to the rules of the statutes when tender is delivered, interest and late charges must stop! XXXX had still not removed it and neither did BARCLAYS have my permission to share my private information to any third party.

Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Barclays, stating that it denied my credit application that I submitted to Barclays back on XX/XX/XXXX, because when I, in good faith, exercised my right to file a consumer complaint against Barclays with the CFPB under complaint number XXXX, a year ago on XX/XX/XXXX, that I allegedly sent a copy of the CFPB complaint to Barclays at a representative 's home address and included that address as part of the complaint that I submitted through the CFPB public website on XX/XX/XXXX. These allegations are untrue. I did not send a copy of the CFPB complaint to Barclays at a representative 's home nor has there been any supporting evidence that anything was mailed to Barclays at a representative 's home. Furthermore, I had no knowledge that the address that was included in the CFPB complaint for the Dispute Advisor at Barclaycard, was that of a representative until receiving the letter from Barclays dated XX/XX/XXXX, which stated that the address was that of a Barclays representative. Nor would I have known the address for any Barclays representative, and the address for the Dispute Advisor at Barclaycard that appears under the CFPB complaint number XXXX was obtained from another public website under Barclays contact , and not for any one specific representative at Barclay. For these reasons, there were no basis to deny the application """" based upon improper and unacceptable interactions '' allegedly had with a Barclays representative regarding my former Barclays account. The most that can be said is that the application was denied on the basis of my age, gender, marital status, race, color and/or for in good faith exercising my rights under State and Federal Consumer Protection laws by submitting the CFPB complaint. When I responded to Barclays ' letter through the CFPB portal on XX/XX/XXXX, it closed the complaint as a duplicate. On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested that Barclays explain why CFPB complaint number XXXX was closed as a duplicate without being addressed by Barclays when it was submitted in response to the XX/XX/XXXX correspodence received from Barclays and the FACTS alleged were materially different from those that were alleged in CFPB complaint number XXXX and relate specifically to events that occurred AFTER submission of that complaint, namely the facts that were disclosed for the first time in Barclays XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  correspondence. On XX/XX/XXXX, Barclays closed that complaint out too as a duplicate without addressing the issue.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","MD","XXXXX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-09-28,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7624878,2023

As a victim of identity theft, it is crucial that I take immediate action to protect my credit and personal information. I have identified certain information in my credit file that I believe is a result of this identity theft. Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681c2, I request that you block the reporting of any information in my file that resulted from this identity theft. 

I kindly request that you promptly initiate the blocking process within four business days of receiving this dispute. The specific information that I believe resulted from the identity theft includes fraudulent accounts, unauthorized inquiries, and incorrect personal information.

Barclay then did a reversal for duplicate payment ( there was never a duplicate payment ) on XX/XX/XXXX My bank sent payment back to Barclay on XX/XX/XXXX through the Federal Reserve System for retrieval. 

Barclay states they can't find the payment.

I have faxed all the information from the bank to them with no resolution. I have been trying to get this resolved since XX/XX/XXXX to no avail. I have been charged late fees and finance charges on my account due to this.

On XX/XX/XXXX I mailed in a payment by check for the full balance at the time, {$2600.00}, check # XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX. The face of the check had the last XXXX digits of my account number on it, and it was enclosed in a sheet of white paper with my full name and address and account number. 
That payment was never credited, and on XX/XX/XXXX my payment went past due. Around that time my card was locked and i called to see what happened. I was told they never received the payment. 

On XX/XX/XXXX the check was paid by my bank. When i discovered this I called on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to a security person to confirm that Barclays had cashed the check. On the back of the check, was a stamp with the following : XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Barclays XXXX I spoke to XXXX, who was a manager. She said she would open a missing payments case so the matter could be resolved. She told me it would take a XXXX  of days. 
On XX/XX/XXXX the card was still locked and i called on the status of the missing payments case and spoke to manager XXXX XXXX. I was told a missing payments case had never been opened. XXXX XXXX opened a missing payments case # XXXX. She transferred me to XXXX in customer service to help me. XXXX told me that the payment HAD been located. XXXX told me that she could apply a credit to my account that would unlock my card within about a day. 
On XX/XX/XXXX the card is still locked. I called and talked to XXXX XXXX who told me that the payment had NOT been located. XXXX told me the missing payments case would take XXXX days to to resolve. He also told me I would receive a letter in the mail with information from the investigation. I told him I was not at my home address, i was traveling, and could not receive mail until XX/XX/XXXX. He told me if i could not receive the letter the investigation would be closed. This is outrageous and unreasonable, as Barclays has my phone number, email address, and there is a """" messages '' portal in my online Barclays account where they can communicate with me. 

Barclays lost my check for nearly a month, locked my account and charged me finance fees and late fees. Then they cashed my check. They have the money, as of XX/XX/XXXX. Yet they give me conflicting information, fail to start the required missing payments case in a timely manner, and refuse to unlock my card, despite the fact that I PAID my balance and they received it. Now they tell me that because i am not at my home address to receive a paper letter, that the investigation will likely be closed and I suppose the payment never credited.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","NY","11237","","Consent provided","Web",2023-01-24,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",6480730,2023

He told us that we needed to upgrade to a deeded contract as the maintenance fee on our current contract was going up to {$750.00} a month shortly and we were not getting the best deal for our money right now. He did a lot of math on a piece of paper ( wished I had it ) to show how we were in a position to upgrade to a deeded property at XXXX XXXX and we would own it. He said there was only possibly one unit left in the complex to purchase as they all had been sold, but there were clients there now who were thinking about upgrading to presidential status and theirs would be available for us. I guess they upgraded as about hour later XXXX XXXX comes back and states you are all set it is yours and now you have deeded property here and XXXX XXXX points. I will also give you 2 airline tickets to anywhere in the US with this purchase. Airline tickets next happened as they might have been free but it wasnt for XXXX proprieties and you needed to stay on the airline proprieties at XXXX XXXX a night. We were also told that we could rent this property to help offset maintenance fees, and use points to pay maintenance fees. Needless to say we signed another contract without totally looking at figures as he was continually talking while we were signing. XXXX said at end of signing any questions call me and I will be happy to help. Never heard or got a hold of him again. I called numerous times when I realized that this contract was something we couldnt possibly pay. You cant even get to that department by phone. 
When XXXX rolled around and I saw the loan payment was {$1200.00} and maintenance fee was {$560.00} that they put on auto pay to my credit card I immediately knew I could not pay this. At this point I called corporate and they said there was nothing they could do. No one would help and I was given XXXX XXXX XXXX to try and rent my points. I transferred XXXX points to their vacation plan through XXXX XXXX XXXX to rent these points and I would get 60 % and they would get 40 %. I had 14 days prior to date of rental to cancel ; I never heard from them so I cancelled all points and took them back. I tried getting XXXX, the salesperson, to call me with no success. I left messages with the business office to have anyone call me back about this contract with no response. After spending all of XX/XX/2020 on this we decided to book a few days there as we knew from past experience we would have to attend one of their presentations and we could get their attention that way. 
On XX/XX/2020 we meet with the assigned person to our account that day after the presentation. We had our contract and told him we needed to speak to someone about getting out of it as we couldnt make these payments. A XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX came and talked with us. At first they said nothing could be done and with this, I said I cant pay this in a room of other potential buyers. They said can you wait a minute we will be right back. Upon returning they said they needed to talk to some other people and go back to our room and they would contact us. We were to meet them the next day. Greeted by XXXX XXXX in the lobby the next day the solution was to take XXXX entirely off the current contract and give him his own contract for a short period based on his current health issues XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX ) we could file for a hardship and get out of the contract through XXXX. In order to do this XXXX needed to be removed from the current contract and just have it in my name. Pay off my contract with money already paid on other contracts and the remainder owed would be put on a contract solely with XXXX as owner. They would also reduce my contract to XXXX points based on money already paid. This sounded feasible at the time but I ( XXXX XXXX was not allowed to go upstairs as they did not want me involved or seen with XXXX at this point. With this contract solely in his name he would be able to claim hardship based on medical condition and get out of contract. 
The new contract was written for {$51000.00} with {$45000.00} already paid from previous contracts. A charge of {$5000.00} was sent to XXXXXXXX XXXX for a loan with a 6 month interest free. XXXX XXXX credit cards were also charged for down payment {$5700.00}, and {$650.00}. An auto pay was set up for {$750.00} for remaining loan and {$110.00} for maintenance fee. My deed was retuned and a new contract was written on XX/XX/2020 with me as sole owner of property. 
When a three month period came and I called XXXX about starting XXXX process, he said nothing was being forgiven because of XXXX. I called again at six month period was told the same thing. On the one year mark I text XXXX XXXX and said I am through I cant pay this any longer and what was I suppose to do, XXXX was bankrupting me. He said call Finance and they would help me. Finance said there was nothing they could do, sell it. Next stop was XXXX  which was supposed to be the hardship route. Called XXXX and a girl name XXXX said she was sorry to hear XXXX  satiation and would call back in a few days. She gave us her phone number and we have never heard from her again. We have left messages with other employees for her to call, she was either on another line or away from her desk. I again reached out to XXXX and he said we could always walk away and not pay. I said I did not want to ruin my credit rating over XXXX and his reply was at your age what difference does it make. 
At this point we finally realized XXXX didnt care and it was time for us to take more drastic measures on our own.

When I saw that wasn't going to clear, I had to put a stop payment on the {$1500.00} charge ( costing me fees from my Credit Union ). Then because Barclays attempted to put it through twice, Barclays hit me with XXXX {$40.00} returned check fees and a late payment fee. I had made an early payment on XX/XX/XXXX of {$150.00} ( close to twice of what my minimum payment should have been and the payment was not due until XX/XX/XXXX. ) Then, Barclays abruptly shut off my credit and unbeknownst to me, lowered my credit limit to slightly above the new balance. If that was not enough, my credit report was affected and my XXXX score shows an XXXX point drop ( solely due to this. ) I had no late payments on my credit report before and my credit capacity was high. Now it is showing a late payment and overbalance. I just don't know how to remedy all this and get it back to where it was before all the previous complaint happened. How can this company even make this right at this point? I'm sure they will figure it out, remove the extra charges and hopefully reinstate my full {$9600.00} capacity, but they can not fix my ruined credit report.

Last week I paid the balance, months prior to the end of the special rate. After the payment was processed I received another interest charge that was 4 times that of my monthly interest charge. When I called to ask what the charge was for I was told that it was because I was making partial payments. The representative first told me that the minimum payment was not really the minimum payment and that it was a partial payment. When I asked her to clarify she said that I was assessed the interest because I didnt pay enough, and then said that I did pay the minimum payment that was required but that didnt count the interest. She did not sound confident in her answers and when I asked to file a complaint she said she would transfer me and I was hung up on. 
I checked the statement and it said that the interest was due on a portion of my remaining balance and not the entire remaining balance. Either way, the interest charged was not something that I have ever seen before and Ive been doing balance transfers for 22 years.

When Barclays decreases the credit line, it adversely compacts my credit score for having a high balance of credit usage.

An example of my complaint : Previous Balance of {$7000.00} and a credit limit of {$10000.00}, which equals a 70 % loan to the credit limit. When they decrease the credit limit to {$7200.00} with no warning or allow the consumer to make corrections, it changes the loan to a credit value of 97 %. This business practice impacts the current and future cardholders because Barclays/Choice Privileges Visa can impact future and downline credit opportunities with this practice.

( My credit union loan officer said they have had issues with Barclays before exactly like this. ) Here 's what I think is going on : Barclays has had close to {$10000.00} from my XXXX XXXX since XX/XX/. They have been earning interest on this from whatever account that money was put into ( certainly not my account... but a general pot. ) So is this is a scheme to make money off interest while sticking their customers and giving them the run around? I don't know, but I know it can not be that hard to track a {$9500.00} check when given a certain string of dates along with the routing n umber it came from and the check number. 

I may never get all this interest they've placed on me back either.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","OH","44646","","Consent provided","Web",2023-06-03,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7061375,2023

2023-06-03,"Debt collection","Credit card debt","False statements or representation","Attempted to collect wrong amount","I am grateful that the CFPB expects companies to provide complete, and accurate responses to consumer complaints, and responses tailored to the issues described in each consumers complaint, yet in an original complaint against Barclays JetBlue World MasterCard being either lost, stolen, or cloned, their response for the investigation they allegedly made, appears in itself fraudulent, and totally invented. Throughout Barclays FRAUD DEPARTMENT investigation, the company failed to properly manage, respond correctly nor in a timely fashion, to my credit card dispute and fraud claim, as per law, and continue to post their debt collection on my online credit card account.

After receiving Barclays Fraud Department XX/XX/XXXX, response to the CFPB, I found four phone conversations with their Fraud Department that I forgot I recorded which are all very contradictory and prove Barclays kept prolonging their investigations, after re-opening of the case just after I called and complained that they returned all the unauthorized charges for me to pay.

This newly found evidence assures me that Barclays Fraud department never fully investigated the matter as per their apparently fraudulent response letter to my CFPB complaint. The mutually agreed upon recorded phone calls are months apart from XXXX to XXXX, when I was so tired of speaking hours on the phone altogether, faxing them more and more documents, so I asked my daughter to please follow up. 

The newly discovered lengthy phone conversation recording I have on an old phone in my possession include one with Barclays XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX ; Barclays Agent XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, Barclays Agent XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ; Barclays Agent XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. All of them insisted the investigations could take up to 90 days but they kept taking more. Apart I have written records of calls with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX who insisted on having a police report made ; with XXXX the manager of the fraud department made on the last Monday, end of XX/XX/XXXX, among others. 

In Barclays response letter to my CFPB complaint, nothing makes any sense. First it claims I received a fraud alert from them on XX/XX/XXXX and then a passcode to unlock my adult daughters authorized users card because she was traveling, when in fact I never received an alert from Barclays, nor a passcode to unlock her card, but originally phoned the Fraud Department from my Florida, US landline and told them to cancel the card because I was alerted of suspicious activity ( by my computer security program and not from Barclays ) on my daughters card while she was already in XXXX XXXX. 

Further proof that Barclays response to its investigation of fraud is their response to my CFPB complaint also states, The representative confirmed with you the transactions were reported as fraud, and informed you he would be closing your authorized users card ending in XXXX and replacing it with the above-referenced card ending in XXXX. In fact, in the documents I sent, such as credit card statements, all the charges made on XXXX XXXX were already made from the card ending in XXXX and not ending in XXXX ; so this Barclays stated fact is impossible and further proof of their apparent investigation fraud. 
Upon receiving my pcs program message to check the credit card account, I immediately saw online large amounts of temporary authorization transactions, so that is why I originally instantly called Barclays to cancel my daughters additional card knowing something serious was wrong since we have never been in the habit of charging such large sums of money and in so many places on the same day. 

From my Florida, US landline, I finally could reach my daughter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, not until the afternoon, who was on an emergency 2-day trip in XXXX XXXX XXXX She told me the card was either lost, stolen or cloned because the last XXXX times she used her card in XXXX XXXX was the previous night at a XX/XX/XXXX just near her two-night XXXX rental and then at a late dinner at the restaurant XXXX, leaving just at their usual closing time, before going to sleep. 

She did not realize until later the same day that her card was missing from her purse since at that restaurant XXXX, they hung up the ladies purses. The next day she told me she called XXXX to talk to the manager who apologized profusely for all the confusion and offered to refund her dinner of {$40.00} which they did shown on my statement period XXXX, since they recognized their responsibility and her innocence and could not explain why her card was missing from her purse. I told her not to worry since I called earlier the same day to Barclays to cancel her card over this fraud and was assured by Barclays that we would not be charged for all the unauthorized charges. Barclays did not say at that time that they would ever return the charges to a later bill nor mention she had to get a police report. 

Further proof of Barclays invented statement in their response to my CFPB complaint, is if as they state her card was locked, why were charges on her card ending in XXXX even temporarily authorized? I sent Barclays screenshots of the charges appearing on XX/XX/XXXX online and even over the phone questioned them about the time of day they were made and exactly where, seeing that the unauthorized charges were made way after midnight on the XXXX and beyond after I even phoned them early in the morning on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Next in their response to my CFPB complaint, Barclays states that I said I was in possession of both cards, which is obviously impossible due to the dozens of unauthorized purchases in XXXX XXXX and the fact that I was calling from my Florida landline in the US both on XX/XX/XXXX. 

At first Barclays took off the reported charges starting the same day, then they reinstated them some two months later which is causing my family extreme hardship since the total unauthorized charges made were over {$3300.00} plus the interest they are charging since I can only afford to make minimum payments on such huge bill for purchases my daughter never made nor authorized, nor received. 

Over the course of all this time, we have had to conduct our own investigation and sent Barclays over 20 pages of diverse documents of proof and a letter explaining all the minutest details. In the meanwhile, Barclays would send us many misleading letters that were contradictive saying she was the same day responsible and the same day not and so on including letters about her being responsible for the XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX charge which we never disputed nor other charges on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On other occasions Barclays also asked my daughter to provide more proof such as a police report when it was impossible for her to return to XXXX XXXX to acquire one in a timely fashion in times still of XXXX, so instead, she wrote the receiving company of many of the charges. XXXX XXXX, to send us copies of the bills and when we received them contained many different fraudulent signatures claiming they were hers so we also sent that to Barclays as proof her US passport with her legal signature Later when her US passport expired months later, Barclays demanded to send a copy of her new passport and as well she did. According to our own investigation XXXX XXXX is a credit card phone service application for small merchants used in XXXX XXXX Their three bills sent to us included long lists of separate charges on a single invoice. The three different invoices we received from them were at establishments and times when they are reported online as closed.

During the course of our dispute, Barclays would send us misleading letters, some separate on the exact same date saying we were responsible in one, and on the other hand not responsible in the other. I included sending them copies of their contradictory letters.

CFPB claims online if there is unauthorized use of your card before you report it missing, the most you will owe for unauthorized charges on the card is {$50.00}. Many cardholder agreements say you are not responsible for any charges in this circumstance. If you have not lost the card itself, but someone steals and uses your account number, you generally have no liability for unauthorized use. 

Apart from all of the above, the listings of the temporary authorizations that were appearing on my online Barclays account on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and relisted in my following XXXX statement were different, mostly from the vendor XXXX XXXX and not from each establishment, and did not correctly mathematically add up. The establishments were all over XXXX XXXX where my daughter was not in possession of a vehicle and another charge included was a very far away gas station with very poor online reviews of previous frauds. 

Finally Barclays is responsible for their inaccurate information and failure to investigate my dispute adequately and for their apparent fraudulent response to the CFPB. I would like Barclays to compensate me for all my losses plus interest which are described and detailed in my original complaint, plus punitive damages for all my time and duress. 

I have also reported their shoddy fraudulent findings to the ReportFraud.ftc.gov FTC complaint on XX/XX/XXXX, and intend to file a FDIC complaint, consult lawyers about opening a lawsuit, as well as reporting Barclays to the BBB for their misconduct.

I spend {$1000.00} or more a month and always pay my monthly balance. My credit score in the past has always been high. In XX/XX/XXXX I disputed a transaction. Barclay 's told me several times at the time of the dispute and recently the dispute would not affect my credit score. There seems to be no end in sight in resolving the dispute, as it has been 3 months with no update. 

Recently I ran into car problems and found myself needing a new car. Thinking my credit was good, I went to the dealer and was shocked to find out I have no credit score or no history to score on when a report was ran. I then went to 2 other banks, went through the process of getting an auto loan, and was told the same thing. I ran a report on XXXX myself, and I have no score. There is a comment on the report for my Barclay 's credit card that says """" account in dispute '' and """" no transaction history ''. I spend about $ XXXX {$20000.00} a year on my credit card and this is completely false. This has caused me much hardship and forced me to get a loan at a higher interest rate. I'm also looking to become a first time home owner and I have ZERO faith that my Barclay 's credit card will do anything to help my credit. I have tried to call all the available Barclay 's departments I can reach from and was told to write a letter to the Barclays FCRA Credit Bureau Dispute. The department I wrote to does not answer phone calls and only accepts letters.

2023-02-04,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem with a purchase shown on your statement","Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card","XX/XX/2022, there were two fraudulent charges on my wife 's XXXX XXXX, Barclays Bank Mastercard credit card. 

Business name : XXXX XXXX XXXX, for {$3100.00} and {$3900.00} The details of this situation were as follows : From XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX we were staying at Breathless, an all inclusive resort in the XXXX XXXX. We did not leave the resort or use our credit card while at the resort at any time. At the time of the charge, the card was in a locked suitcase in our hotel room. There was evidence that the suitcase was broken into but nothing was physically taken, it was reported to our hotel concierge but no official report was filled out. We did not realize our card was compromised and simply put back into the bag. 
XXXX XXXX I received an e-mail at XXXX Fraud alert, which I didnt see until XXXX that night. I attempted to call to have these charges revoked but the hold time was long and I was on vacation and couldnt get through. 
XXXX XXXX, morning, When I initially called to report the fraud, based on the name of the company, I thought they were charges in XXXX XXXX, not The XXXX XXXX. Additionally, when I reported the fraud I thought the charges were on my card and not my wifes. The customer service agent canceled my card and issued me a new one, at no point indicating to me that the charges were actually done on my wifes card not mine. I discussed the charges with the agent. Questioning how someone in XXXX XXXX could have gained access to my account information. At no point did the agent correct me and tell me the charges were actually sourced out of XXXX XXXX, not XXXX XXXX. Due to this, it took me a full two weeks, XXXX XXXX, to realize the charges were on my wifes card not mine and within the XXXX XXXX not XXXX XXXX. By this time I was home back in the US. I promptly canceled my wifes card and had a new one issued. 
XXXX XXXX I called again to follow up on the status of having the charges removed. I was told it was still under review. 
At some point the charges were removed and I was elated, because I can not afford to pay $ XXXX for something we didnt order or purchase. 
XXXX XXXX I saw the charges back on my account! I was shocked. I called and was told the fraud claim was rejected? I was told I was to receive a letter in the mail explaining. 
XXXX XXXX I received the letter from Fraud investigations which explained that because the card was on our person that they determined the charges had to be legitimate. I called again and was told that I had to send a letter requesting the case to be re-opened. On this day I wrote and mailed a letter requesting the case to be re-opened. 
XXXX XXXX I received a call from Customer service. They indicated that the letter had been received and the case would be re-opened. Operator ID XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I called to follow up. I was told that the letter had actually not been received and the case was not re-opened and that I had to send another letter. This time I sent the letter certified mail. Along with this letter we included, photo evidence including time stamps, that we were at the beach at the all inclusive resort with many witnesses, not in possession of our card, nor in a situation where it would make any logical sense for us to be applying over $ XXXX in charges at a rental car agency ( or whatever kind of business the charges were ). Further more, we can find no evidence of this business XXXX XXXX XXXX existing, online or otherwise. 
XXXX XXXX I received notification from USPS the certified mail was received. 
XXXX XXXX I called to follow up. Spoke with XXXX XXXX - I was told the letter was received, logged on XX/XX/XXXX, and in review and they needed 7 to 10 business days to from when it was received ( presumably XX/XX/XXXX ) to review the case. 
XXXX XXXX Called and spoke to agent XXXX  - I was told the review was not completed yet and to check back on XX/XX/XXXX if I saw no changes to my account. 
XXXX XXXX I saw no changes to my account so I called and spoke to Agent XXXX. At this time I was told the case was in fact not reopened until XX/XX/XXXX and that it would be a further 10 to 15 business days before I would see the results of the investigation. At this point, I got very frustrated and asked to speak to a manager. I was told there was no manager and I would receive a call back. 
XXXX XXXX A manager returns my call ID : XXXX - The Manager tells me that my case has been reassessed and that we are STILL liable for this fraudulent charges He tells me its because we still had the card in our possession and it was a chip reader charge. At this point I just dont know what to do I pled with him to help. I asked for his supervisor. At this point he says there is no supervisor to speak to and I am liable for the charges. He suggests I write an appeal to the office of the President of the Bank.

We are still pending a response from the office of the President but have lost all hope of these charges being reversed. 
This is quite possibly the worst experience I have ever had with any business let alone credit card company. I dont understand why the burden of proof for fraud is on me as the card holder vs. this business to which the charges were applied, which is clearly in on the fraud.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","NY","11757","","Consent provided","Web",2023-02-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6525070,2023

I paid off and closed my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ending in XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I cut up the card and didnt keep any statements, so I do not have the full account number available. I am writing as the incorrect 30-day delinquent payment from XX/XX/XXXX is still appearing on my credit reports even though it was an error caused by Barclays. This issue was settled as soon as I saw it and I was told it would be removed from the reports, but it hasn't been. 

Ive always had this card set up for automatic monthly payments and it fell off without notice and I had no idea the payment hadn't been made. When I contacted Barclays about the delayed payment issue, they refunded the amount and I promptly paid the outstanding balance and closed my account. The late fee was refunded and I was told the negative mark would be removed from all credit reports. This was a lie as not only has it not been removed, they are now refusing to remove it even though none of this is my fault. 

To add another element of absurdity - as a consequence of this single delayed payment over 13 years - Barclays also reduced my credit line from {$10000.00} down to {$500.00} without any notice whatsoever. 

As if this hasnt been traumatic enough, I had a horrible experience with Barclays ' fraud department that went over an excruciating 7 months from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. They offered zero protection when they absolutely should have. I am not happy at all that there are now more issues and Im having to chase them down AGAIN to rightfully clear my name. I will never do business with Barclays again. Period.

2023-09-04,"Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports","Credit reporting","Incorrect information on your report","Account information incorrect","To : Barclays Bank Delaware Cc : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Reference # XXXX. Thank you for your prompt response to my recent CFPB filing where you included the attached Arbitration Clause which I requested. Pursuant to it, I ELECT to have any Claim by either of us resolved exclusively by arbitration with the American Arbitration Association ( AAA ). In bold and capital letters print, you wrote and we further agreed in the recap summary : ARBITRATION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM IS BINDING AND NEITHER YOU NOR WE WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE THAT CLAIM THROUGH A COURTALL CLAIMS MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH ARBITRATION. The Clause provides that if either of us willfully violates the Clause, even after my election, by filing prohibited litigation, such as in a state or federal court : If any Claim is advanced in a court, arbitration may be elected under this provision instead. This means that effectively due to my election you must file an arbitration demand with AAA and pay all fees so any litigation would be null and void as a mere ministerial filing of a demand with fee payment would NOW effectively be assumed and concluded that the Claim is NOW in Arbitration making litigation barred as a Claim can not be litigated and arbitrated in 2 separate forums when you have agreed to arbitrate as the sole forum. So if you frivolously sue me in a court, after my election today, the Clause anticipates that I would file a Motion to Compel Binding Forced Private Arbitration with AAA which would AUTOMATICALLY STAY any litigation under Florida Statutes ( FS ) Section 682.03 ( 6 ) which specifically provides that once a motion to compel arbitration has been filed, the court must STAY any judicial proceeding that involves a claim alleged to be subject to Arbitration until the Court renders a final decision on arbitrability of the dispute. Any decision on a Motion to Compel Arbitration is an appealable decision which, if appealed which I would do if denied, would further Automatically STAY the case pending Appeal for at least 12-24 months. See US Supreme Court No 22-105 XX/XX/XXXX decision in COINBASE v Bielski . If I am improperly sued in a state court and you do not agree to arbitrate, I would file a Petition in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida XXXX Division to Compel Arbitration with AAA. Under the Federal Arbitration Act, a party aggrieved by the alleged failure, negligent or refusal of another to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration may petition any U.S. district court for an order directing that such arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement. I would easily be successful in any expected federal court action if I am improperly sued and you refuse to arbitrate. While I could file for arbitration with the AAA, I want to avoid stupid litigation if I pay the initial {$220.00} fee and you litigate in federal court that you should pay the fee costing {$50000.00} in attorney and other fees for no reason other than to harass. So if you want to collect your disputed Claim you must file a Demand For Arbitration Consumer Arbitration Rules with AAA and pay all fees including those of the Arbitrator which easily will be ultimately over {$25000.00} which will not be recoverable from me including your attorney fees even if you prevail which is impossible due to my Claims against you for multiple statutory FCRA willful violation plus punitive damages far exceeding your dispute Claim. Your arbitration terms of service incorporates by reference the AAA Rules that expressly delegates arbitrability determinations to an arbitrator and the agreement clearly and unmistakably evidences the parties intent to empower an arbitrator, rather than a court or judge, to resolve questions of arbitrability. See AIRBNB V DOE, Florida Supreme Court # SC20-1167 decided XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore, once an arbitration agreement is presented to a court, the court is powerless to consider arbitrability as such has been delegated to the arbitrator. Due to your arbitration provisions, courts are powerless to act and they are automatically stayed if I move to compel arbitration. Dont waste your money with court filing fees and attorney fees as you will alienate the court and waste resources only to find court actions forced into arbitration with AAA . That is why court actions are automatically stated to prevent a complete waste of time as arbitration agreements must be enforced. Besides, court decisions are clear that Florida does not have a Small Claims Court, but a mixture of rules so again dont embarrass your attorneys by asking them to frivolously litigate. Lets arbitrate!!! File with the AAA and pay its huge fees. Never expect AAA fees to be recouped. Never expect a return of attorney fees. I will automatically appeal any decision of a court, state or federal, that does not compel arbitration and provide me relief from frivolous conduct such as Federal Rule 11. If you sue me in state court, you will certainly see a motion To Compel Arbitration, staying it, PLUS a federal court Petition to compel arbitration PLUS a Demand for Arbitration by me with the AAA requiring you to pay all fees PLUS federal claims for FCRA and FDCPA violations both in federal court and AAA. By virtue of my election in this document and previous documents, it is indisputable that the Claim and Dispute is already with the AAA absent a mere ministerial 2 page demand by you with your payment of AAA fees. So court litigation is completely barred and any such filing will be considered frivolous willful conduct punishable under the FCRA and FDCPA punishable with a dismissal with prejudice of any court claim. If you are stupid and just want to harass me, you should expect years of litigation in multiple state and federal courts, including the US Court of Appeals PLUS no court would enforce any AAA award against me due to your conduct including FCRA and FDCPA violations. In SAUNDERS v Branch Banking, 526 F.3d 142 ( 4th Cir. XXXX ), the jury awarded Saunders {$1000.00} in statutory damages and {$80000.00} in punitive damages for FCRA violations for failing to report the ongoing dispute. Using the multiple of 80 upheld, if I am awarded {$5000.00} in statutory damages I expect {$400000.00} in punitive damages applying the 80 multiple. Moreover, the Saunders jury found that the underlying debt was extinguished and uncollectible due to conduct far less than yours. This means that your Disputed Claim must be extinguished due to your FCRA violations PLUS I have huge claims for multiple ongoing statutory and punitive damages. My FCRA violations against you are DEEMED WILLFUL, providing a {$1000.00} statutory damage per violation based on on the CFPBs XX/XX/XXXX Fair Credit Reporting : Facially False Data advisory opinion of Director XXXX XXXX which stated : A violation is willful when it is inconsistent with authoritive guidance from a relevant agency. Therefore, every FCRA must be considered WILLFUL subjecting you to liability under 15 U.S.C. Section 1681n for willful noncompliance in addition to Section 1681o for negligent noncompliance. Federal courts would have federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Section 1331 as they have jurisdiction to enforce liability under 15 U.S.C. Sections 1681p and 1692 ( k ) without regard to the amount in controversy. At a minimum, I can only settle a claim if you agree to absolute confidentiality of settlement PLUS the permanent removal of Claims from every credit reporting agency which will not disclose or imply settlement. Any written settlement must also include general releases of all parties to forever end the possibility of future litigation. While judges, mediators and arbitrators always try hard to force settlement, I am always open at any time to settle a dispute under fair terms based on developments. If you sell a claim to a debt buyer, your liability will not end but it may increase and arbitration will still be required and enforced ending up more complicated with more parties. In summary, the ball is in your court on how you wish to resolve the dispute which may be best taking the tax deduction and walking away without selling the toxic claim. I will not be the first to seek relief but, as listed above, I will aggressively counter any and all efforts to collect your disputed claim in litigation and/or arbitration. Dont waste $ XXXX in your shareholders money for AAA arbitration fees and your attorney fees to try unsuccessfully to collect {$0.00} owed knowing that I am owed potentially huge statutory and punitive damages. In light of my cease and desist demand which continues forever as I will never withdraw it, I can not communicate with you but I invite you to make a one time permissible exception for you to WRiTE me in the CFPB portal about what non-binding exact terms you may consider to resolve all claims. I hope this CFPB complaint will make my position clear about forum resolution options which exclusively require arbitration with the AAA. If this is not enough, I am a XXXX year old male in poor health with a short time more to live and I am judgment proof as my entire income is from Social Security, exempt from garnishment, and I have no other income or assets and I need treatment abroad and residency abroad. Serving me abroad will not comply with FS 2.516 and will only result in any attempted service to be return as unserved. I hope this informs you of the situation so you do the right thing.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","FL","32836","Older American","Consent provided","Web",2023-09-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7496267,2023

I am writing to formally request that my case of aggravated identity theft be reconsidered and re-investigated by the respective financial institutions : XXXX XXXX, Barclays, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, among others. 

I have previously disputed fraudulent activities in my accounts with these financial institutions. Unfortunately, I have not been fully reimbursed for the monetary losses incurred due to these fraudulent transactions despite presenting substantial proof to validate my claims.

Therefore, I am seeking the intervention of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I kindly urge you to instruct these financial institutions to properly revisit my case and conduct thorough investigations again into these fraudulent activities and transactions. It is crucial for me to recover the money stolen from me and also to ensure that such an incident does not reoccur. 

To further substantiate my claim, I am ready to provide any necessary documentation or support that would be needed in the due process. I am keen to cooperate fully and provide any additional information as requisite to expedite the resolution of this matter. 

Your prompt attention and assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please advise on the necessary steps I should undertake to progress this issue favorably. I, hereby, also extend my sincere thanks for your service in advance.

I returned the item in store on XX/XX/2023 at XXXX ( XXXX security camera can confirm ) and even took a picture of the item being in store before leaving because the lady did not give a receipt since it was originally ordered online ( picture I provided Barclay thats shows I dropped off the item, even shows XXXX items and Customer Service Desk in the background ). After a month went past, I reached out to XXXX, who told me to open a dispute with my bank. I did and after opening one, over two weeks go by & I dont hear anything from Barclays about it even though I forsure provided proof. I contact Barclays & speak to a manager who tells me they reached out to XXXX & confirmed it was returned and I would see a credit in a few days. A few days go by & I dont see a credit, I receive a letter in the mail after asking the manager that day to re-send the letter that he said was apparently sent out to me about a credit. When I received the letter, the letter stated the opposite and stated Barclays investigated and XXXX refunded me on XX/XX/2023 for {$17.00} and my dispute is considered closed but in my favor. I was completely confused from this letter because 1. I NEVER received a credit for {$17.00}, 2. There is no activity on my account at all on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX. How is it considered closed when I paid {$57.00} for the item and not {$17.00}, so even if they refunded me {$17.00} in which they didnt, that still doesnt equal to {$57.00} how can you even give less than half a refund when I returned the whole thing which was one item and that one item was a mattress topper. Barclays claim to have investigated the issue with XXXX but it seems as though they didnt. I receive a letter dated XX/XX/2023 about how they were going to investigate and then on XX/XX/2023 it was all completed within such a short period of time. 

I called on XX/XX/2023 about this letter because not only does it state the complete opposite of what I was told, its filled with lies. Barclays did NOT investigate this transaction at all, and most likely thought I would just accept the letter and move on, or completely forget. I never received a refund from XXXX for that amount on that day, I researched my account looking for it and there is NOTHING of the sorts, I double checked bank statements and transaction history. On XX/XX/XXXX, after calling Barclay multiple times about this letter and to explain to me why they did not actually investigate this and why the XXXX would they say I was refunded on this certain day and I actually wasnt. I asked the representative to find the transaction on my account to confirm with the letter I received and she couldnt and stated she was confused on why I received the letter as well. 

I asked this dispute representative to put me in touch with a Manager to get to the bottom of this and also re-open my dispute and actually investigate it because as of XX/XX/2023 I still dont have the refund of {$57.00} not even a partial refund from it and I dont have the product. The merchant CAN NOT keep the product and keep my money as well. Every representative refused to allow me to speak to a manager and stated one wasnt available, even though they were unable to figure this out. I asked for them to set up a call back with a manager because this letter is inaccurate. The representative who refused a manager then told me on the phone that a entirely different charge for a completely different purchase from XXXX which amounted in {$16.00} on XX/XX/2023 and a different one for {$0.00} was the refund that I was owed from the dispute of {$57.00} and refused to listen when I stated multiple times its not, that was an entirely different purchase and XXXX still owes me {$57.00}. I also asked for proof of this information and if that is what XXXX is claiming and not just the representative herself, to provide ME that documentation that shows what she is claiming is coming from XXXX themselves because at this point its all he/she said. Barclay Mastercard is basically speaking on behalf of XXXX without showing ME the customer any proof of communications with XXXX. I would like all proof and the receipts XXXX have apparently provided to Barclay that shows the {$16.00} & {$0.00} are directly related to the original charge of {$57.00} because if an investigation was actually done & Barclays reached out to XXXX they would give me the supporting documents that were used to verify I was refunded but BARCLAY CAN NOT DO THAT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT ACTUALLY INVESTIGATE. 

I am making this complaint to have the company that closely monitors Banks contact Barclays so they are AWARE of what Barclays is doing, have Barclays re-open my dispute, and also provide me all the documentation that the merchant provided to support the {$17.00} that was apparently refunded to me. Once again I have NOT received a refund from XXXX, I bought a mattress topper for a total of {$57.00}, I RETURNED the mattress topper that cost {$57.00} but have yet to receive that refund to my Barclays account. I also have yet to receive a call back from Barclays as of XX/XX/2023 even though I was told someone would call me back after being refused a manager multiple times on XX/XX/2023. I called at least six times on XX/XX/2023 trying to get this resolved and at this point XXXX is refusing. 

As of XX/XX/2023 I tried reaching out to Barclays again about the issue. I reached out to their billing disputes department and regular department by calling XXXX which is the number listed on the letter and called XXXX which is listed on the back of my card. Ok today XX/XX/2023 the associate I first spoke too acted clueless on what I was talking about, so I once again asked for a manager where I was put on hold for a long time & then I get told either the manager isnt available or the associate tried to relay a message of what the manager apparently said, even though I have asked multiple times to speak to one MYSELF, as the regular associates employee, XXXX who works in the disputes department, I spoke to on XX/XX/2023 could not get manager on the phone after asked for one more than two times and stated it takes 48-72hrs for a call back. When I called multiple last week and more than 72hrs have passed. 

I am also attaching pictures of the original letter I received, and also the same letter I received again after asking the associate to mail it out to me again, the day I asked this was on XX/XX/2023 as the first one hadnt showed up yet. The reprint of my statement is not actually my statement it was the letter about the {$57.00} being in dispute. 

Please also note, I am attaching pictures of my call log, of me speaking to Barclay on XX/XX/2023 where I was told the {$57.00} would be credited to my account within a few days. The same number I called, is the same number on the back of my card. 

Please also note the dates of the letters I received of Barclay closing my case & saying I was issued {$17.00}, it is dated XX/XX/2023 a day before I spoke to an associate who never once on XX/XX/XXXX mention anything about what the letter said nor did he ever state I was already apparently credited, I wasnt told the dispute was closed either on this day even though on his end he could see this letter as he was the one that told me a letter was sent out & I simply requested it to be sent again because I did not know. This employee willing withheld this information from me while I kept asking when did Barclay speak to XXXX, when will I receive something stating Im being credited the {$57.00}, I can see now all the questions I asked this associate he just lied because why not mention & say whoever investigated the issue apparently said I was credited already.

I would advise ALL Barclay card holders when filing a dispute with this XXXX disgusting company to get ALL documentation & communication that went into investigating the dispute as it is our right.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","IL","61801","","Consent provided","Web",2023-07-31,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7331911,2023

Once I received the card, I tried to make a purchase and it was declined. I contact Barclay and was told several conflicting information regarding verification. Firstly, I was led to believe it was my phone # ( I changed my cell phone in XXXX of XXXX ). I believe they were trying to verify me using the old #. Secondly, I purchased my home in XXXX of XXXX, so I think that also was an issue. The problem with that is I update my account with the company. I have another credit card with this incompetent company. Thirdly, I was asked to submit my 1040 tax return, current utility bill and copy of my drivers license ; I did but with resistance. Finally, they received the documents but told me my 1040 form was not acceptable but I was not given a reason why. I finally told them I am done, I will not submit another document. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email informing me that I have a bill due in XXXX for {$99.00} from this said company. I knew it was the annual fee but why would I get charged the fee on a card that is not yet able for use? I call the company on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about the charges, to check the status of the card, and to vent about the frustration of this poor inadequate system. I was told my social security number is the problem. Not sure how my SS is the problem, not sure if I used the wrong SS to apply for the card that was initially approved. I know it is not the SS # on Form 1040. I asked to have the {$99.00} removed and to close the account. In the conversation, the representative read a statement regarding the card I asked to close and I heard something that lead me to ask a question. Apparently, the {$99.00} was charged back in XXXX and I was not notified. The rep indicated that I selected a paperless statement ; I asked her when did I do that, especially since I was locked out of my online account in XXXX. I could not access my other account until XX/XX/XXXX after I closed the Jetblue XXXX XXXX. I was told that my password was locked. Not completely true, another rep told me I could not access my other account because of the current issue. The same steps I took on XX/XX/XXXX to access my account are the steps I took hours before calling customer service. This experience was so frustrating. This is by far the worst company and process I have ever dealt with. Why approve a credit card and then have the customer prove their identity AFTER approval? I think the {$99.00} fee charged in XXXX without a statement or without my knowledge impacted my over 800 credit score. XXXX off with that. I have dealt with this issue since XXXX. Calls got disconnected from their end and no one call back. I had to hold for over 30 minutes at times.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I checked on the status of the transfer and saw it was marked as completed, stating the money went a XXXX account ending in XXXX digits that did not match my XXXX account. 

I contacted Barclay bank was told to wait until XXXX as it takes time to transfer. I was also told the ending XXXX digits of the receiving bank, as shown on the balance transfer transaction, did not really mean what it stated. I was told it was a code of some sort that even the phone representative could not explain or access. 

I contacted them again on XXXX as the money was still not reflected as a credit to my XXXX bank account. 

I had multiple messaging communication online as well as the phone calls and each time I was told to 'wait '. 

On every phone call I was asked for the receiving bank account number, which I provided. On one of the latter calls, I was told that I obviously mistyped the number so the money went to someone else 's account and a 'case ' was opened for research. I was told it would take XXXX bus days to complete the research. 

I called today, XX/XX/XXXX, and this time I was told that when I requested the balance transfer I somehow typed XXXX digits into what should be a XXXX digit field. And ... the number I typed was somehow a valid account number at the receiving bank! 

I was again told to wait it out for the research to be completed as it could take up to 90 days! 

I asked to speak with someone else and was transferred. XXXX told me the money likely went to a 'holding account ' at the receiving bank. Ok, fine.. so let 's get this reversed. I have been alerting you since XX/XX/XXXX that there was an issue.

I handed my card to the clerk to pay for gas. He turned towards the pump to ring me up, which caused his back to be to me, to charge the transaction. He acted like the card wasnt reading. After he turned back towards me I noticed he had the card reader in one hand and his cell phone in the other which I thought was strange. He returned the card to me, I left the gas station and immediately pulled over to lock my card as I had a feeling something shady had just occurred. It was too late as the charge for gas was on my account as well as another charge for {$1300.00}. I immediately called Barclays to report the fraud. I also attempted to find a police station while on the phone with Barclays to report the theft. If they have the phone recording of our call, you can hear me clearly very distressed. I waved down a policeman and attempted to ask where the police station was. I also tried to tell him that my credit card had been stolen by the gas station attendant. Unfortunately, Neither of us understood the other. Due to the language barrier and XXXX maps providing incorrect information, I never found the police station after over an hour of searching. I did the only thing I could think of to hopefully help other travelers avoid this situation/gas station and posted my experience on a XXXX travel forum on XXXX. 

Barclays initially removed the charge. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Barclays dated XX/XX/XXXX stating they determined the card had been in my possession and the charge was valid. The card was absolutely not in my possession, it was in the possession of the gas station attendant who ran a fraudulent charge and illegally stole my information. 

I called Barclays who informed me I needed to fax a signed statement as to what occurred. I submitted this statement on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received another letter from Barclays dated XX/XX/XXXX saying that they determined I was responsible for the charge as I failed to maintain security of the card. I am dumbfounded by this finding. I had to pay for gas so I had to hand my card to the attendant. I did not know he was running an illegal, unauthorized, fraudulent charge on my card until after I left the gas station and checked my account. 

I am shocked at Barclays handling of this situation. I have had an account with Barclays for several years. I have never missed or been late on a payment and have never had a fraudulent charge before this.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","AL","350XX","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2023-06-08,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7091848,2023

We redeemed XXXX points and paid {$1500.00} out of pocket for the trip. We reviewed the available options for hours prior to booking, specifically seeking the best possible flight that had a refundable ticket option. We paid an additional premium over the standard fair of roughly ~ {$200.00} per ticket for the refundable fare classes on both legs of the journey. The Luxury Card rewards program website """" rewards terms of service '' state that """" All reservations are final and non-refundable unless a refundable ticket is redeemed. Cardmembers who wish to cancel a reservation will forfeit their rewards redeemed for that reservation and may incur additional supplier fees. '' After reading this, we assumed that our refundable ticket would be indeed refundable. Little did we know or understand, the booking was completed by a third party with its own terms of service, which state that all bookings are nonrefundable. The URL showed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX' so we had no reason to believe we were subject to a new set of terms and conditions. Ultimately, we had to cancel the flight due to my wife being pregnant with twins and being due to deliver earlier than expected ( which is also why we specifically booked refundable tickets ). I cancelled the flight directly on the airline 's website ( XXXX ), which is said I had to do in order to request a refund. XXXX issued us a flight credit to rebook a flight on their airline by end of XXXX ( which we have no intent to do and no use for this credit ). I completed their refund request form, following the instructions on the website. The refund request was subsequently denied and their refunds team said that the """" travel agent '' had to request the refund on my behalf. I shared this information with the Luxury Card concierge agents whom I had been in contact with as well, in an effort to get the refund issued. The Luxury Card team issued me a case number and said they would look into it to get the refund and try to get us an exception to their policy of forfeiting points if a booking is cancelled. The case failed to produce any results, so I escalated to a supervisor on the phone. The supervisor informed me that the second ( return ) leg of the trip, which was booked on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, was not a refundable fair type and that it was the reason XXXX wouldn't issue a refund for the booking. I asked how this was possible when I specifically paid more for the refundable fair, and he couldn't provide an answer. In fact, we wouldn't have even been able to select our seats on that flight had we not selected the """" Flex '' class of service, which had """" refunds '' listed in its included features with a green checkmark ( an example of this is shown in the attachments on a different flight ). The supervisor also couldn't explain why they sell """" refundable '' tickets at a higher cost than normal tickets if their terms of service policy is to provide no refunds and supersedes any other conditions. He also couldn't explain how their policy of forfeiting points on cancelled trips also applied to the value of cash used in addition to points to complete a booking. This all seems highly suspicious and predatory. It's evident that they pocketed the additional premium we paid for the refundable tickets on the second leg of the journey ( first leg did show as refundable, despite not working ) when they booked the tickets on our behalf. The supervisor agreed with me that them selling """" refundable '' ticket options was misleading and that he would escalate it internally for informational purposes, but still could not offer us a resolution.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE","AZ","85268","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2023-02-13,"Closed with non-monetary relief","Yes","N/A",6565561,2023
