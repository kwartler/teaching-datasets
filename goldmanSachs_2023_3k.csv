This is all of my savings other than $ XXXX for emergency. The account states that once opened, it has no limit on how much and how often I can withdraw funds from this account. 

On XXXX I withdrew {$1200.00} back into my XXXX XXXX account. No problem. 

On XXXX I withdrew {$6200.00} back into my XXXX XXXX account. They said there would be a 3 day delay which I thought was strange, but was eventually transferred. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Marcus by Goldman that my account was now frozen for fraud. I immediately called them and they said it was frozen for fraud and they couldnt tell me why. I then requested them to close my account and to have the remaining funds transferred back into my XXXX XXXX account. They approved and said it would take 7-10 business days. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I had not received the transfer so I called them to request a status update. After speaking with a few agents they confirmed my savings account number and amount and that it would be transferred in 1-3 business days. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I still had not received the transfer, so I called back. This is now the 13th business day from the original request. They said my account is still under review and they are not sure when it will be approved to be transferred. They gave me generic answers about processes and what not. I expressed all my money is in this account and I need it to pay my bills. Each time I call it takes about an hour and I get nowhere. Im not confident that I will ever receive my money back. I was then transferred to someone else who again confirmed my XXXX XXXX savings account number and dollar amount and said this would take 1-3 business days. They gave me a money transfer case number of XXXX. 

Each time I talk to someone they act like this is a brand new request from me. I now have credit card bills I need to pay and they are holding my money hostage with no confident answer as to when they will transfer it back. All I want to do is close my account and have my money transferred back to my XXXX XXXX account and they are refusing to do so.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","UT","840XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-28,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8071142,2023

2023-11-13,"Credit card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem with a purchase shown on your statement","Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement","I have been battling with Apple Card for 4 months on these disputes. There were XXXX fraud charges, totaling around {$1500.00} each for about a total of {$8000.00}. I will walk you through the day these happened and everything that happened in the dispute to follow. 

I was in XXXX on vacation, when in the afternoon of XX/XX/XXXX I passed by this red pop-up tent in the middle of the XXXX in XXXX, XXXX man approached me about an event that was going on for the town. They were out raising money by offering some really great prizes. The game started with a few XXXX, then a few more. When I said I didn't want to give any more of the XXXX XXXX I had, that is when the SCAM started. The street vendors explained that with their credit card machines they would give the best exchange rate possible, XXXX to XXXX. So I could continue with the best exchange rate possible. The real scam came from the credit card machine they used, it was a small calculator sized machine with just a tiny screen that made it impossible to read anything on it. After they inserted the card, they had me sign on a tablet or phone, WITHOUT any dollar amount on it, it was just a line to sign on. No receipt or anything was given with any transaction. There was NEVER a point in which I could see the amount being charged by the street vendors. My card ended up being locked after the fifth charge by them and I could not access any information on the account. The Apple Card screen on my phone just stated that the account was frozen, no other information to see. Not until I called to unfreeze the card was I aware that they made these charges in USD. THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION ON THE VENDOR 'S PART ABOUT MAKING CHARGES IN USD FOR THE AMOUNT OF {$1500.00}! The agreed amount was {$1500.00} XXXX, something like {$90.00} USD. The entire operation is a scam and there are multiple posts online about it being a scam. 

I let Apple Card know that these were not legitimate charges as soon as I found this out. I got the charges reversed and they told me they would do an investigation and to send in evidence. I did my best to find what I could, talks of this place pulling similar things on other tourist, was about the only thing I could find. I sent that in and waited for a response. XXXX months later, I got very short email stating the dispute is reversed, because no billing error was found, and that I had a right to see all the evidence gathered in the investigation. I furiously reached out to get the information that they gathered because I know there isn't any evidence to support these charges. The response I got from the Apple Specialist was that the only evidence gathered was what I sent in, and she said she would send that over, its been XXXX months and I still haven't received it. But from what I can gather there was not a proper investigation done. 

Even after this, I called to get this reinvestigated. I called and this time the specialist told me that the original specialist filed this incorrectly. That I need to dispute this as a case of paying the charges in XXXX, so it is an adjusted amount dispute. If you ask me, this is crazy that I have to fight this hard for these fraud charges and I still have to pay. But either way, {$90.00} a charge instead of {$1500.00} is at least something I can live with. A quick side note, I haven't been out of the country much, but I XXXX sure have never spent that kind of amount of money in somewhere I am unfamiliar with. Back to the dispute, I get this all re-disputed, send in all the evidence I can gather, and I wait another XXXX months. I woke up today, XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX more emails from Apple, """" Your transaction dispute is complete and will remain on your account. '' This time with the same short description as to why, but this time NO talk of having the right to see all the evidence gathered in the investigation. So again, I sent what I could in, I did my part, and there doesn't seem to be a proper investigation done. I do NOT believe Apple Card is doing their part in protecting my rights as a consumer. 

I will attach a screenshot of the chat with the Apple specialist that stated they would send the evidence gathered in this case. I never received it, and I will also include where they stated that they in fact hadn't gathered ANY addition evidence outside of what I submitted.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","TX","770XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-11-13,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7844626,2023

I require signatures for delivery of high value items such as the XXXX, however, I was only notified of the delivery AFTER the courier company ostensibly performed the delivery. I was NOT at my residence, an open-air apartment building, at the time of the supposed delivery. 

I received an email notification from the courier stating that the package had been successfully delivered to my address. To my shock and dismay, I never authorized such a delivery, nor did I receive photographic evidence ( or any other form of evidence ) to substantiate the claim that the parcel was in fact delivered. 

Upon arrival at my apartment residence to retrieve the parcel, there was no proof of delivery at my doorstep or in my mailbox. I immediately contacted Apple and filed a complaint regarding the missing delivery.

I have also reported the incident to the local police department, and a copy of the police report has been submitted to Goldman Sachs and Apple.

At this juncture, I have been abundantly patient, but am now eager to resolve this situation as swiftly as possible currently, this process has been dragging on for months. And it has become increasingly obvious that other consumers such as me are being left in a never-ending loop.

Unfortunately, as a consumer, it appears there may be a direct conflict of interest between the Apple Card userbase experiencing such concerns and the financial entanglements between Goldman Sachs and Apple.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","CA","92660","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-15,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",8004363,2023

XXXX aka scopolamine is an infamously potent drug that's used to rob people and can be administered in a number of ways, including in someone's drink. It's odorless and tasteless, but the real devastation is that it wipes your memory and renders you highly suggestible to anyone, including your assailants. Things like ATM pin numbers are freely given over ; victims have been known to assist their captors with removing furniture and belongings from their home, etc. It can be read more about here : https : XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX after checking my Apple Card balance, I saw that it was significantly higher than it should have been it showed 3 massive charges that I had no memory of making : XX/XX/XXXX {$1200.00} to Bold Club ( Bold is XXXX 's version of Square to XXXX payments on mobile ) XX/XX/XXXX {$630.00} Inversiones XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX {$800.00} The transactions were made between XXXX A.M. and XXXX A.M. 

Not even aware that I had """" missing '' time from my memory, I retraced my steps from the night of XXXX XX/XX/XXXX using the memory I did have, as well as geo-tagging on my XXXX, XXXX XXXX  XXXX etc. 

I was with XXXX men who I had met at a club as they told me they were the owners and had a VIP section. Given that I was traveling alone, havinXXXX two XXXX  men who were in a position of authority and invited me in felt like I would be safer. 

They were receiving free drinks and offered me some. We went to 2-3 more destinations together with them and some of their friends, and at some point during all of this the scopolamine was administered to me. 

On the XXXX once I realized I'd been robbed, I immediately told the manager of the hostel where I was staying. He had also been """" scoped '' as they call it last year. He heard my entire story and said when I had arrived home the morning prior I was disoriented and agitated. 

An employee of the hostel accompanied me to the police station where I filed a police report. That report was then mailed via XXXX to Goldman Sachs, which apparently only accepts snail mail via their XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which XXXX can't deliver to ( and there's no XXXX in XXXX ). Consequently I had to have the package diverted to my mom 's in California, where she could open the report and send it by XXXX to Goldman Sachs. This was sent Priority Certified on XX/XX/XXXX. 

The police concluded I was likely given burundanga, given that my symptoms were exactly how the drug affects people, the high rate of its use, the area I was in XXXX XXXX T ) which is known for tourism and therefore targeting tourists, and the huge amounts of the transactions which far exceed the cost of almost anything in XXXX ( for perspective, a month 's rent at my apartment in XXXX is {$290.00} ; so nearly {$2800.00} is an insane amount for XXXX. 

I also noticed on XX/XX/XXXX that I seemed to have a welt on my upper left forehead, as though I had been hit there. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received 3 notifications ( one for each transaction ) in my email that Goldman Sachs/Apple XXXX XXXX XXXX my disputes, and they were denied because I """" authorized '' transactions, with no recognition of the fact that I was under duress and drugged. 

I was shocked, saddened, and angry. It felt like I was being robbed all over again. To undergo a traumatic experience like that, only to be told that """" we don't believe you '' and to have that money taken again is a terrible feeling. 

I called the Apple Card Specialist number listed in the email I received and spoke to a woman for something like XXXX minutes. She couldn't even tell me whether Goldman Sachs had bothered to read the police report given that it was obviously written by the officers in XXXX. 

This money is a huge amount to me. I can't afford to lose it. There is article after article out there about this drug and the toll it takes on people ( some are overdosed and end up XXXX ). I've met many people who've been scoped, and I really hope these charges are reversed so that I can start to heal from the trauma of this incident.

XXXX XXXXXXXX, the bank in charge of my checking account, failed to send a payment claiming insufficient funds. However, there were sufficient funds to cover the transaction. I immediatly tried to send an additional payment through the apple card app, but it would not allow it, until the transaction was fully rejected. Thus, I was charged interest on the XXXX and XXXX transactions, as per the terms and conditions. I complaint to both XXXX XXXXXXXX and Goldman Sachs as this was outside of my control, and I immediatly had posted pay as soon as the Apple Card app allowed it on XX/XX/XXXX. Goldman Sachs credited only {$25.00} of the {$120.00} charged. As per terms and conditions, I reinstated authorization of automatic full monthly balance payments. The terms state that by the next due date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) as long as the XXXX balance, along with the declined payment of XXXX ( due XX/XX/XXXX ) and the interest charges were paid, the grace period would be reinstated. This time, the Apple Card app, failed to cover the monthly balance including the interest charge as authorized by me, the user. Interest was charged again for the amount of {$80.00}. By XX/XX/XXXX, I paid fully the XXXX balance, plus the interests, which were still in dispute. I had opened several cases and had several calls and text conversations with Goldman Sachs customer service department. Including high level supervisors, which claim they are clueless as to why I am being charged, but that they refuse to credit the account. On XX/XX/XXXX, interest was charged again on the amount of {$38.00}. As per terms and conditions, once all monthly balances and interest are paid in full by due date, grace period is reinstated for the running month. As a user, I fulfilled all responsibilties of authorizing the application for full monthly balances on due date, which include all corresponding interest charges for each period. Both XXXX XXXXXXXX  and Goldman Sachs have been negligent in their responsibilities to fulfill and settle transactions on my behalf, as formally authorized via their respective digital platforms. I was held unfairly, and perhaps fradulently ( at least for the last charge ), accountible for these errors and charged interest for which I expect full credit on my account. In conclusion, Goldman Sachs is violating their own terms and conditions, for interest charges posted on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, as I have abide by the rules of payment authorization and settlement of full monthly balances by their respective due dates. Yet grace periods are not being honored.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","PR","00926","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-11,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7980127,2023

the Fair Credit Reporting Act 15 USC 1681 section 602 states """" There is a need to ensure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and respect for the consumers right to privacy. '' I have the right to make sure my private information isn't shared which is backed by 15 USC 6801 which states """" It is the policy of the Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers nonpublic personal information.

'' apple card and the Consumer reporting agencies XXXX and XXXX do not have my consent to furnish this information, as I have already revoked all whether it be verbal, non-verbal, written, implied or otherwise in my notice dated XX/XX/23 which all companies have received and it is also evidenced by my first complaint filled on XX/XX/23 id XXXX and XXXX. 

15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ) states that """" A financial institution may not disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party unless the consumer is given an explanation of how the consumer can exercise that nondisclosure option. '' APPLECARD never informed me of my right to exercise my nondisclosure option. in addition to this, I have written several complaints against Apple for their willful noncompliance in honoring my opt-out request. apple card stated that they received my notice to opt out and continued to dishonor it because """" Customers are unable to opt out of credit reporting ''. 

I asked Applecard for the law that states I was unable to opt out of reporting since I contended that 12 CFR 1016.10 ( a ) ( 1 ) EXPLICITLY STATES """" ( 1 ) Conditions for disclosure. """" you may not, directly or through any affiliate, disclose any nonpublic personal information about a consumer to a nonaffiliated third party unless : ( ii ) """" You have provided to the consumer an opt-out notice as required in 1016.7 """" ( iii ) """" You have given the consumer a reasonable opportunity, before you disclose the information to the nonaffiliated third party, to opt out of the disclosure; and ( iv ) The consumer does not opt-out. '' under section 2 12 CFR 1016.10 ( 2 ) """" Opt out means a direction by the consumer that you not disclose nonpublic personal information about that consumer to a nonaffiliated third party, '' apple card failed to meet the conditions of disclosure as they 1 never provided me the consumer an opt-out notice.2 they never gave me a reasonable opportunity to opt out of the disclosure. and XXXX I have sent two formal notices to opt out that date back to XX/XX/23. Apple Card stated in their response that I consented to their terms and agreements that permitted them to furnish my data. in their card member agreement, does not state at all the option to opt out or how to exercise my nondisclosure agreement. you can find their agreement online at XXXX XXXX XXXXwww.goldmansachs.comXXXX on page 14 is their """" Credit Information & Credit Reporting '' which states """" This section describes how we use information about you that we obtain from credit bureaus, what information we may provide about you to credit bureaus, and how to dispute items on your credit bureau report. '' it continues to page 15 but nowhere in this agreement was I given notice of my right to opt-out or exercise a nondisclosure agreement. 

12 CFR 1016.10 ( b ) clearly states that ( 1 ) You must comply with this section, regardless of whether you and the consumer have established a customer relationship.

( 2 ) Unless you comply with this section, you may not, directly or through any affiliate, disclose any nonpublic personal information about a consumer that you have collected, regardless of whether you collected it before or after receiving the direction to opt-out from the consumer. 
since APPLECARD failed to comply with the federal code they are not permitted to furnish my data yet they still are reporting adverse claims to my report unlawfully. 

in addition to this APPLECARD stated The privacy policy was provided to the Customer at the time of account opening ( https : //www.goldmansachs.com/XXXX XXXX at any time. again this policy does not mention my ability to exercise my right to opt-out. 

I made Apple Card aware that per 12 CFR 1016.7 APPLE CARD must provide a clear and conspicuous notice to each of its consumers that accurately explains the right to opt-out under that section. The notice must state : ( i ) That you ( applecard ) disclose or reserve the right to disclose nonpublic personal information about your consumer to a nonaffiliated third party ; ( ii ) That the consumer has the right to opt out of that disclosure; and ( iii ) A reasonable means by which the consumer may exercise the opt-out right.

again applecard failed to provide this critical information to me during the time I had an account with applecard. also as stated in section ( ii ) clearly states that I the consumer have the right to opt out of the disclosure between Applecard and I. Among the violations applecard also had unreasonable opt-out means as the only way I can opt out is to write a letter which violates 12 CFR 1016.7 ( 2 ) ( iii ) that states You ( applecard ) do not provide a reasonable means of opting out if : """" ( A ) The only means of opting out is for the consumer to write his or her own letter to exercise that opt out right ; ''. 

I again ask the cfpb to help me enforce my consumer privacy rights and demand applecard to provide the law that states I can not opt out since APPLECARD has made baseless claims that """" customers can not opt-out '' and have failed to provide any proof of this claim even after I specifically asked them for clarity on this matter. as I have made my rights to opt-out, and expressed APPLECARD violations of federal law under 15 USC 1681 section 604, and15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ) clear backed by my consumer privacy rights codified in the cfr 12 CFR 1016.4, 12 CFR 1016.10, and 12 CFR 1016.7, I ask that applecard provide proof of claim that, they tried to contact me on the said dates they stated, law or any other federal code that disputes my rights to opt-out. in both complaints that were filed, they failed to furnish the proofs I have asked for. 
apple card has provided false claims against my consumer rights. Apple Card has also used deceptive trade practices that have negatively impacted my financial capabilities. because APPLECARD 's actions have caused me significant emotional and financial distress as a result of the unlawful invasion of my consumer privacy. I am asking for the immediate removal of all reporting and to be opted out upon receiving this notice. I ask that CFPB protect my consumer rights as I continue to be negatively impacted by applecard will noncompliance and neglect.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","FL","32301","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-28,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8070732,2023

2023-12-08,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Managing an account","Deposits and withdrawals","On XX/XX/2023, I discovered that approximately {$37000.00} had been transferred from my Marcus by Goldman Sachs ( Goldman Sachs USA ) savings account beginning on XX/XX/2023 through XX/XX/2023. In each instance, {$1000.00} was transferred out of my account to an XXXX account at XXXX XXXX XXXX. It seems this activity was done to evade AML structuring monitoring as well as the reporting requirements. I did not authorize any of these XXXX transactions. I have completed the necessary WSUD forms as provided by Goldman Sachs within the 10 business day time-period. I have called several times to determine when a provisional credit would be issued in my savings account as it is now Day XXXX of the investigation. These calls have been futile at this point as Goldman Sachs ' employee do not understand the language of their own deposit agreement, which mirrors Regulation E. 

Despite our 10 calls to Marcus by Goldman Sachs, the bank refuses to issue a provisional credit to me despite its own Deposit Agreement stating that they will provide a provisional credit within 10 business days, if the investigation takes longer. I am consistently told that an internal review is ongoing and we do not issue provisional credits. I simply want my funds returned to me. 

Pursuant, Regulation E ( 12 CFR Part 1005 ) of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act ( https : //www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/regulations/1005/11/ ), the act states : ( 2 ) Forty-five day period. If the financial institution is unable to complete its investigation within 10 business days, the institution may take up to 45 days from receipt of a notice of error to investigate and determine whether an error occurred, provided the institution does the following : ( i ) Provisionally credits the consumer 's account in the amount of the alleged error ( including interest where applicable ) within 10 business days of receiving the error notice. If the financial institution has a reasonable basis for believing that an unauthorized electronic fund transfer has occurred and the institution has satisfied the requirements of 1005.6 ( a ), the institution may withhold a maximum of {$50.00} from the amount credited.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NJ","079XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-08,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7972056,2023
2023-11-18,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Closing an account","Company closed your account","On XX/XX/XXXX, my savings account was forcibly closed and all interest paid YTD ( {$4300.00} ) was taken away. I called in on XX/XX/XXXX and the customer service representative would not explain why. I then called in on XX/XX/XXXX and tried to find out why it was closed. It was escalated to a supervisor named XXXX and she was no help either. She was not customer friendly. I asked where my money was and she said it would be mailed, but offered no date when I could expect it. I asked to speak to someone else and she said there was no one else. It been 2 weeks now and nothing been received. I am sure a bank of your stature does not have only CSRs running it. Surely, she could have escalated my concerns further. I am totally dissatisfied with your company. 
I sold my business and now have excess cash coming in and I wanted to put it in several high rate saving accounts. Periodically, I check my several banks and move money to substantial higher paying bank accounts. This is exactly what I did in XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I tried to transfer out 2 transactions ( {$79000.00} and {$54000.00} ) and they were denied. I called in and explained that I was moving money to a higher paying bank and the customer service representative removed the block. The next day I was successful in transferring these two deposits to XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ). 
I did not receive anything in the mail about account closure. This would be the most appropriate way to communicate. Email communication would also work. Your company has both of these methods to contact me with. I did receive a voice message on my phone from the fraud department but thought since I did call in and your customer service representative removed the block, all was good to go. There have been no further communications that I am aware of. I felt good about your company since I have a GM Rewards card with you. I have been a customer of the bank since XX/XX/XXXX and feel I should not be treated this way. 
What I want is my money back, my YTD interested credited back ( {$4300.00} which I have earned ), and interest from XX/XX/XXXX to present. I did not do anything wrong.

APPLECARD-GS BANK USA however continued reporting this fraudulent APPLECARD-GS BANK USA account with the credit bureaus.

These """" late payments '' are in the way of me getting approved for other credit cards and is lowering my credit score. I demand that its corrected pursuant to : 12 CFR 1026.13 - Billing error resolution.

( a ) Definition of billing error. For purposes of this section, the term billing error means : ( 1 ) A reflection on or with a periodic statement of an extension of credit that is not made to the consumer or to a person who has actual, implied, or apparent authority to use the consumer 's credit card or open-end credit plan. ( 2 ) A reflection on or with a periodic statement of an extension of credit that is not identified in accordance with the requirements of 1026.7 ( a ) ( 2 ) or ( b ) ( 2 ), as applicable, and 1026.8.
( 3 ) A reflection on or with a periodic statement of an extension of credit for property or services not accepted by the consumer or the consumer 's designee, or not delivered to the consumer or the consumer 's designee as agreed.

( 4 ) A reflection on a periodic statement of the creditor 's failure to credit properly a payment or other credit issued to the consumer 's account.

( 5 ) A reflection on a periodic statement of a computational or similar error of an accounting nature that is made by the creditor.

( 6 ) A reflection on a periodic statement of an extension of credit for which the consumer requests additional clarification, including documentary evidence.

( 7 ) The creditor 's failure to mail or deliver a periodic statement to the consumer 's last known address if that address was received by the creditor, in writing, at least 20 days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement was required.

( b ) Billing error notice. A billing error notice is a written notice from a consumer that : ( 1 ) Is received by a creditor at the address disclosed under 1026.7 ( a ) ( 9 ) or ( b ) ( 9 ), as applicable, no later than 60 days after the creditor transmitted the first periodic statement that reflects the alleged billing error ; ( 2 ) Enables the creditor to identify the consumer 's name and account number; and ( 3 ) To the extent possible, indicates the consumer 's belief and the reasons for the belief that a billing error exists, and the type, date, and amount of the error.

( c ) Time for resolution ; general procedures.

( 1 ) The creditor shall mail or deliver written acknowledgment to the consumer within 30 days of receiving a billing error notice, unless the creditor has complied with the appropriate resolution procedures of paragraphs ( e ) and ( f ) of this section, as applicable, within the 30-day period; and ( 2 ) The creditor shall comply with the appropriate resolution procedures of paragraphs ( e ) and ( f ) of this section, as applicable, within 2 complete billing cycles ( but in no event later than 90 days ) after receiving a billing error notice. 

( d ) Rules pending resolution. Until a billing error is resolved under paragraph ( e ) or ( f ) of this section, the following rules apply : ( 1 ) Consumer 's right to withhold disputed amount ; collection action prohibited. The consumer need not pay ( and the creditor may not try to collect ) any portion of any required payment that the consumer believes is related to the disputed amount ( including related finance or other charges ). If the cardholder has enrolled in an automatic payment plan offered by the card issuer and has agreed to pay the credit card indebtedness by periodic deductions from the cardholder 's deposit account, the card issuer shall not deduct any part of the disputed amount or related finance or other charges if a billing error notice is received any time up to 3 business days before the scheduled payment date. 

( 2 ) Adverse credit reports prohibited. The creditor or its agent shall not ( directly or indirectly ) make or threaten to make an adverse report to any person about the consumer 's credit standing, or report that an amount or account is delinquent, because the consumer failed to pay the disputed amount or related finance or other charges.

( 3 ) Acceleration of debt and restriction of account prohibited. A creditor shall not accelerate any part of the consumer 's indebtedness or restrict or close a consumer 's account solely because the consumer has exercised in good faith rights provided by this section. A creditor may be subject to the forfeiture penalty under 15 U.S.C. 1666 ( e ) for failure to comply with any of the requirements of this section.

( 4 ) Permitted creditor actions. A creditor is not prohibited from taking action to collect any undisputed portion of the item or bill ; from deducting any disputed amount and related finance or other charges from the consumer 's credit limit on the account ; or from reflecting a disputed amount and related finance or other charges on a periodic statement, provided that the creditor indicates on or with the periodic statement that payment of any disputed amount and related finance or other charges is not required pending the creditor 's compliance with this section.

( e ) Procedures if billing error occurred as asserted. If a creditor determines that a billing error occurred as asserted, it shall within the time limits in paragraph ( c ) ( 2 ) of this section : ( 1 ) Correct the billing error and credit the consumer 's account with any disputed amount and related finance or other charges, as applicable; and ( 2 ) Mail or deliver a correction notice to the consumer.

( f ) Procedures if different billing error or no billing error occurred. If, after conducting a reasonable investigation, a creditor determines that no billing error occurred or that a different billing error occurred from that asserted, the creditor shall within the time limits in paragraph ( c ) ( 2 ) of this section : ( 1 ) Mail or deliver to the consumer an explanation that sets forth the reasons for the creditor 's belief that the billing error alleged by the consumer is incorrect in whole or in part ; ( 2 ) Furnish copies of documentary evidence of the consumer 's indebtedness, if the consumer so requests ; and ( 3 ) If a different billing error occurred, correct the billing error and credit the consumer 's account with any disputed amount and related finance or other charges, as applicable.

( g ) Creditor 's rights and duties after resolution. If a creditor, after complying with all of the requirements of this section, determines that a consumer owes all or part of the disputed amount and related finance or other charges, the creditor : ( 1 ) Shall promptly notify the consumer in writing of the time when payment is due and the portion of the disputed amount and related finance or other charges that the consumer still owes ; ( 2 ) Shall allow any time period disclosed under 1026.6 ( a ) ( 1 ) or ( b ) ( 2 ) ( v ), as applicable, and 1026.7 ( a ) ( 8 ) or ( b ) ( 8 ), as applicable, during which the consumer can pay the amount due under paragraph ( g ) ( 1 ) of this section without incurring additional finance or other charges ; ( 3 ) May report an account or amount as delinquent because the amount due under paragraph ( g ) ( 1 ) of this section remains unpaid after the creditor has allowed any time period disclosed under 1026.6 ( a ) ( 1 ) or ( b ) ( 2 ) ( v ), as applicable, and 1026.7 ( a ) ( 8 ) or ( b ) ( 8 ), as applicable or 10 days ( whichever is longer ) during which the consumer can pay the amount ; but ( 4 ) May not report that an amount or account is delinquent because the amount due under paragraph ( g ) ( 1 ) of the section remains unpaid, if the creditor receives ( within the time allowed for payment in paragraph ( g ) ( 3 ) of this section ) further written notice from the consumer that any portion of the billing error is still in dispute, unless the creditor also : ( i ) Promptly reports that the amount or account is in dispute ; ( ii ) Mails or delivers to the consumer ( at the same time the report is made ) a written notice of the name and address of each person to whom the creditor makes a report ; and ( iii ) Promptly reports any subsequent resolution of the reported delinquency to all persons to whom the creditor has made a report.

( h ) Reassertion of billing error. A creditor that has fully complied with the requirements of this section has no further responsibilities under this section ( other than as provided in paragraph ( g ) ( 4 ) of this section ) if a consumer reasserts substantially the same billing error.

( i ) Relation to Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E. A creditor shall comply with the requirements of Regulation E, 12 CFR 1005.11, and 1005.18 ( e ) as applicable, governing error resolution rather than those of paragraphs ( a ), ( b ), ( c ), ( e ), ( f ), and ( h ) of this section if : ( 1 ) Except with respect to a prepaid account as defined in 1026.61, an extension of credit that is incident to an electronic fund transfer occurs under an agreement between the consumer and a financial institution to extend credit when the consumer 's account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer 's account ; or ( 2 ) With regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of a prepaid account where both are accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in 1026.61, an extension of credit that is incident to an electronic fund transfer occurs when the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses both funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account and a credit extension from the credit feature with respect to a particular transaction.

I called on XX/XX/XXXX to request a wire transfer of $ XXXX to my checking account on file as I am closing on a house the week after and need to make sure the money is available. I tripled checked that they let me know if there are any issues as this was a time sensitive matter, and they agreed. 

Fast forward XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX and the wire transfer still hasn't been received. I called again the same day and inquired and they confirmed that the wire transfer has been sent but I need to contact my received bank ( XXXX ) as maybe they are having trouble processing it. I called XXXX and they confirmed that no wire transfer has been sent. I then called Marcus back and they said that there was a problem with the wire transfer but that they are unable to tell me what the issue is. I remained patient ( albeit furious on them not taking any responsibility ), and after wasting another XXXX mins over the phone they said they sent an expedited wire transfer. Later the XXXX, I called to double check so they said that the wire transfer has been sent AFTER the cut off time which contradicts what they told me and that will waste another business day when I have a deadline to close on the house that I need to meet. I asked again why the negligence and she laughed it off rather than taking any responsibility. And still I have no idea when I will receive my money.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","MI","48126","","Consent provided","Web",2023-11-14,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7842340,2023

I called the Marcus customer service number and was advised that I should call back in 3-5 business days. On XX/XX/2023, I called back to Marcus customer service and was advised that I should wait another week and then call back because they could not verify my identity. On XX/XX/2023, I called back to Marcus customer service and was informed that I would be sent in the mail an Affidavit of Identity ( AOI ) and that I should notarize and return the AOI to be reviewed in order to prove my identity. They informed me that the AOI would be sent in 3 to 5 days. After five days had passed, I did not receive the AOI and so I called again on XX/XX/2023 and was informed that they had not yet sent the AOI but that it would be sent to me by mail. I finally received the AOI, sent to my permanent address on XX/XX/2023. I was able to have the AOI notarized on XX/XX/2023 and mailed the document by registered mail on XX/XX/2023. I called Marcus on XX/XX/XXXX to inform that I had mailed in the AOI and was informed that I should call back in about a week. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and was informed that they had not yet finished confirmation of my AOI and that I was to call back in a week. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Marcus again and was asked to call back in another week. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called back and was informed that my AOI had been rejected and that I should call back in 3 to 5 business days for next steps. I called back Marcus on XX/XX/XXXX and was informed this time that my account was going to be closed and that they would return my funds back to the funding account. I asked for confirmation of my funding account and although they could not confirm the entire account, they confirmed that the last four digits matched with the numbers that I had given to them. We then confirmed that they would close my account and return the monies in the account to my funding account. The next day, XX/XX/XXXX, they called me, and said that they could not confirm my funding account and that if the account could not be confirmed, they would have to send me a check. I asked how long it would take to receive the check and was not given a clear response, only that it had to go through another approval process, which could be length, before they would send me my check. They asked me to call back and today, XX/XX/XXXX when I called back, they said that they could not talk to me about my own account because the phone number on my account did not match what I had give them verbally. I had confirmed my personal phone number on each call with them and returned the four digit code sent by text each time, however now they claimed that another number was on my account as the phone number. I confirmed that the phone number was my father 's phone number. I have now been locked out, with no access online to my account for over two months. I have waited patiently, Marcus has not sent me paper statements during the time that my account was locked out and they still refuse to provide me with any information on my account, even simple information such as account balance. They say they will send the paper statements, but we have not yet received any statement. At this point, I have lost complete faith and trust in banking with Marcus and wish that my monies be returned to me at once.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NJ","07450","","Consent provided","Web",2023-11-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7805939,2023

The creditor is obligated to correct the billing error and credit my account with any disputed amount and related finance or other charges, as applicable. Additionally, they must mail or deliver a correction notice to me. 

Pending the resolution of the billing error, I retain the right to withhold the disputed amount, and the creditor may not attempt to collect any portion of any required payment related to the disputed amount, including related finance or other charges. If I have enrolled in an automatic payment plan offered by the card issuer and agreed to pay the credit card indebtedness by periodic deductions from my deposit account, the card issuer shall not deduct any part of the disputed amount or related finance or other charges if a billing error notice is received any time up to 3 business days before the scheduled payment date.

Furthermore, as defined in 15 U.S. Code 1601, the term """" credit card '' encompasses any card, plate, coupon book, or other credit device existing for the purpose of obtaining money, property, labor, or services on credit.

Under 15 U.S. Code 1666d, concerning the treatment of credit balances, the creditor must take the following actions whenever a credit balance in excess of {$1.00} is created in connection with a consumer credit transaction : A.

Moreover, in accordance with 15 U.S. Code 1693m - Civil Liability, I am entitled to : Actual damages resulting from the creditor 's failure to comply. 
In the case of an individual action, an amount not less than {$100.00} nor greater than {$1000.00}. 
Lastly, under 15 U.S. Code 1693n- Criminal Liability, any failure to provide information as required by the aforementioned regulations may result in fines or imprisonment.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called back and spoke with the same person I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, who told me they have not sent the Affidavit of Identity and it's still pending approval and I should call back later in the week, I asked for a call back from a Supervisor and did not receive a call back. 

I waited a full week, on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to a XXXX who said it's still in the queue to be approved. I advised I was planning on filing a complaint against the company and if she could please let whoever is in charge know that I called back and would like to speak to a supervisor, they said they could submit a request for one to call back. I still did not receive a call back from a supervisor. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called again and spoke to XXXX, who immediately advised she would send me a one time code to verify me, which she did and I gave her that code. We were able to proceed with the call and she told me the letter was approved to be sent out today and it should take 1-3 business days for me to receive it. ( please note : this is how it all started, the first agent, XXXX, said she could not send me the one time verification code to a phone that was not registered in my name but XXXX was ). I did not request a supervisor call back this time because I thought the issue was being resolved. 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX I still have not received the letter and called Marcus again. I spoke to Destiny, who advised the letter was just placed in the mail on XX/XX/XXXX and it will take 7-10 business days for me to receive it. I asked for a supervisor call back and she said she could transfer me over to one. I was on hold for 6 mins and was advised no one answered the line and she would submit a request for a supervisor or manager to call back but I could also call back at XXXX XXXX  for a supervisor. I opted not to do that based on my history with this company and will check back next week to see the status of the Afidavit of Identity letter.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","OR","97070","Older American","Consent provided","Web",2023-09-20,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7580690,2023

In XXXX, I opened both a checking and savings account with XXXX XXXX. I initiated two transfers of {$500.00} each, one from my XXXX account to the new XXXX XXXX checking account and the other from my Apple Saving account ( managed by Goldman Sachs Bank USA, XXXX XXXX XXXX Branch ) to the XXXXXXXX XXXX saving account. Not long after, XXXXXXXX XXXX terminated both of my new accounts. While I received a refund notification for the checking account, and indeed the {$500.00} was returned to my XXXX account, the same can not be said for the {$500.00} from my savings account. 

I promptly visited a local branch of XXXX XXXX to inquire about the missing funds. The bank personnel informed me that the money had been withdrawn from XXXX XXXX  and should now be in Goldman Sachs Bank. Acting on this advice, I contacted Goldman Sachs, where I was told to wait several more days for the funds to reflect in my Apple Saving account. However, after waiting for over 14 business days, the funds have yet to appear in my account. 

This situation has caused me considerable stress and inconvenience, and I have undertaken due diligence in liaising with both banks to no avail. As a consumer, I trust financial institutions to manage transactions efficiently and transparently. In this instance, there appears to be a discrepancy that neither institution is willing or able to rectify. 

I kindly request the CFPB 's intervention in mediating this matter to ensure a fair and timely resolution. Attached, please find relevant documentation, including transaction records, email communications, and notes from my interactions with both banks. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a positive resolution and appreciate the CFPB 's assistance in this regard.

But in XXXX, XXXX they locked my account for no reason ( had not been linked recently nor used in any way ). When I called to unlock, they spent half an hour telling me they couldn't figure anything out, then tried to transfer me and hung up on me instead. After another 45 minute call, the finally got me to a department that claimed to be doing a security check by sending me a code to a phone number -- that they asked me to give them. ( I could have been anyone! ) I gave them my number ( it's on the account ) and they said their service would not send a code. Just wouldn't do it. That makes no sense, I told them, I've gotten security codes from Marcus on that number for months. 
I asked them to send a code to my email on record ( a standard fallback for most banks ). They said they could not do that. They offered to send the code to a different phone number! ( Awful security practices! ) I gave them my wife 's. Their system would not send a code there either. 
To fix things, they say I have to fill out a notarized form ( they won't send it via email for printing, only snail mail ) THEN get it notarized, they mail it back THEN wait a few days THEN call them back again and go through all that and hope someone will actually unlock the account. Then I have to hope I can move the money out without their shutting the account down again. Given their complete lack of knowledge about the account 's status and their own procedures, I am not confident this will be resolved in a timely fashion.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","VA","XXXXX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-03-26,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6752366,2023

I contacted support and was told to contact them again during regular business hours. 

XX/XX/2023, I contacted Apple Credit Card ( Goldman Sachs Bank Bank USA ) and after verifying my information, made a one-time phone call to the number on my account, providing me with a number to call back to remove the lock on my account. I called the number to remove the lock, and while on hold, I received another notification on my phone, this time related to my Apple Savings Account issued by Goldman Sachs Bank Bank USA. My savings account had now been locked. This lock meant I could not access any of my own money in my savings account, I could not withdraw this money or transfer it back to the linked checking account. 

When I reached Apple Card Support, I was notified that my savings account was locked due to my Apple Credit Card being locked. I was told that I could not access my Apple Savings Account or my Apple Credit Card until a """" review '' had been completed on my account.

I asked for a timeframe of how long such a review would take, seeing as I had all of my money in this savings account and needed to access this money to pay bills, etc... I was told there is no timeframe for the review. I asked if they could transfer the balance of my savings account to the checking account of another financial institution already linked to the Apple Savings Account, and they told me there was nothing they could do on the account until the Apple Credit Card review was complete.

I was given instructions that, first, the Apple Credit Card review would be conducted. When that was completed, and access was restored to my credit card account, only then could I contact Apple Savings Account support to get the lock removed from my savings account. 

I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told the supervisor was not available until Monday.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","CO","80234","","Consent provided","Web",2023-10-14,"Closed with non-monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7697591,2023

My original complaint ( XXXX ) was filed because there was an """" inadvertent processing error '' by Goldman Sachs and my Apple Card was overpaid by {$480.00}. Goldman Sachs/Apple Card initially refused to refund my overpayment.

Additionally, I was informed that there would be a trailing interest charge because of their mismanagement of my account. 

Goldman Sachs refunded the {$11.00} interest that should have never been charged and informed me they would also automatically refund the trailing interest charge ( I specifically asked if I needed to initiate the refund and was told that I did not ).

On multiple occasions, Goldman Sachs has denied my credit card application, stating that the reason for the denial was a """"prior history of delinquent or derogatory accounts."""" However, I have provided documentation and information that contradicts this statement about my credit history. The dates of these denials were XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, twice on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

I believe that Goldman Sachs has violated the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and other consumer protection laws by providing false or misleading information in connection with my credit card application. I am seeking a resolution to this matter and obtaining a correction from Goldman Sachs.

Furthermore, on XXXX XXXX XXXX, I sent a correspondence to Goldman Sachs regarding this issue, which they signed and acknowledged receipt of. Despite this, Goldman Sachs has continued to deny my credit card application and provide false and misleading information.

The definition of """"set-off"""" refers to a defense to all or a part of a plaintiff's monetary claim. In this case, Goldman Sachs may be using the false and misleading information about my credit history as a defense to my claim for a credit card account. This could potentially be seen as a violation of TILA and other consumer protection laws, as lenders are not allowed to use false or misleading information as a defense to a consumer's claim for an extension of credit.

Additionally, the definition of """"consumer"""" under TILA includes a natural person to whom consumer credit is offered or extended, as well as a natural person in whose principal dwelling a security interest is or will be retained or acquired if their ownership interest in the dwelling is subject to the security interest. As a consumer who applied for a credit card and has been denied based on false and misleading information, I may be able to argue that Goldman Sachs has violated TILA and other consumer protection laws by failing to disclose accurate and complete information to me as a consumer.

As a result of Goldman Sachs' actions, I have been denied access to credit, which has had a negative impact on my financial situation. I have been unable to make important financial decisions and purchases because of this denial, and it has caused stress and frustration. I am seeking a resolution to this matter and obtaining a correction from Goldman Sachs.

I would like to request that this matter is promptly addressed and that Goldman Sachs is held accountable for their actions. I am available to provide any further information or documentation that may be necessary to support my complaint.

Adjustments
Adjustment is a settlement, allowance, or deduction made on a debt or claim that has been objected to by a debtor or creditor in order to establish an equitable arrangement between the parties.
For tax returns, an IRS-approved change to tax liability is considered an adjustment.
When money is owed to a lender, debt adjustments are made by creditors or judges who exempt debtors from a part of their obligation, in light of ongoing circumstances; like insolvency.
In insurance law, an insurance companys settlement on a claim is referred to as an adjustment. The companys adjustment reflects the sum of money the company is willing to pay on behalf of a claimant after negotiation and consideration of the parties gains, losses, and rights.
Set-offs, contributions, and subrogation are also examples of adjustments.
A set-off is a statutory defense to all or a part of a plaintiffs monetary claim. It also refers to the adjustment of losses against profit or income by a taxpayer in a particular tax year.

Credit
Credit means the right granted by a creditor to an applicant to defer payment of a debt, incur debt and defer its payment, or purchase property or services and defer payment therefor.

consumer credit
Consumer credit refers to the ability of a consumer to access a loan. The most common form of credit used by consumers is a credit card account issued by a financial institution. Merchants may also provide direct financing for products which they sell. Banks may directly finance purchases through loans and mortgages.

The law of consumer credit is primarily embodied in federal and state statutes. These laws protect consumers and provide guidelines for the credit industry.

States have passed various statutes regulating consumer credit. For example, the Uniform Consumer Credit Code (UCCC) has been adopted as law in eleven states and Guam. Its purpose is to protect consumers obtaining credit transactions and ensure that adequate credit is available. To do this, the UCCC includes provisions outlawing waiving rights through contracts and sets caps on interest rates. 

In 1968, Congress passed the Consumer Credit Protection Act to further regulate the consumer credit industry. This act requires loan providers to explain financial terms to consumers, restricts the garnishing of wages, prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex or marital status, and established the National Commission on Consumer Finance to investigate the consumer finance industry. While this commission has since disbanded, credit card companies and credit reporting agencies are still regulated by the Act.

In XXXX  XXXX, President Obama signed into law the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure (CARD) Act. This statute even further constrained the practices of financial institutions that issue consumer credit cards. These new regulations include bans on practices such as charging interest on balances that have already been paid off, hiking interest rates without notice, and marketing towards college students. Additionally, the act requires interest rates on consumer credit instruments to remain static for at least one year after the consumer obtains it. Most notably, however, the CARD act contains provisions regulating the use of credit default swaps and increased penalties for noncompliance with federal credit regulations.

(ii) A termination of an account or an unfavorable change in the terms of an account that does not affect all or substantially all of a class of the creditor's accounts; or

(iii) A refusal or failure to authorize an account transaction at point of sale or loan, except when the refusal is a termination or an unfavorable change in the terms of an account that does not affect all or substantially all of a class of the creditor's accounts, or when the refusal is a denial of an application for an increase in the amount of credit available under the account; 

(iv) A refusal to extend credit because applicable law prohibits the creditor from extending the credit requested; or 

(v) A refusal to extend credit because the creditor does not offer the type of credit or credit plan requested.

(d) Age  refers only to the age of natural persons and means the number of fully elapsed years from the date of an applicant's birth. 

(e) Applicant  means any person who requests or who has received an extension of credit from a creditor, and includes any person who is or may become contractually liable regarding an extension of credit.

(f) Application  means an oral or written request for an extension of credit that is made in accordance with procedures used by a creditor for the type of credit requested. The term application does not include the use of an account or line of credit to obtain an amount of credit that is within a previously established credit limit. A completed application means an application in connection with which a creditor has received all the information that the creditor regularly obtains and considers in evaluating applications for the amount and type of credit requested (including, but not limited to, credit reports, any additional information requested from the applicant, and any approvals or reports by governmental agencies or other persons that are necessary to guarantee, insure, or provide security for the credit or collateral). The creditor shall exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining such information.

(n) Discriminate against an applicant  means to treat an applicant less favorably than other applicants. 

(o) Elderly  means age 62 or older. 

(p) Empirically derived and other credit scoring systems  - 

(1) A credit scoring system  is a system that evaluates an applicant's creditworthiness mechanically, based on key attributes of the applicant and aspects of the transaction, and that determines, alone or in conjunction with an evaluation of additional information about the applicant, whether an applicant is deemed creditworthy. To qualify as an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system, the system must be: 

(i) Based on data that are derived from an empirical comparison of sample groups or the population of creditworthy and non-creditworthy applicants who applied for credit within a reasonable preceding period of time; 

(ii) Developed for the purpose of evaluating the creditworthiness of applicants with respect to the legitimate business interests of the creditor utilizing the system (including, but not limited to, minimizing bad debt losses and operating expenses in accordance with the creditor's business judgment); 

(iii) Developed and validated using accepted statistical principles and methodology; and 

(iv) Periodically revalidated by the use of appropriate statistical principles and methodology and adjusted as necessary to maintain predictive ability. 

(2) A creditor may use an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system obtained from another person or may obtain credit experience from which to develop such a system. Any such system must satisfy the criteria set forth in paragraph (p)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section; if the creditor is unable during the development process to validate the system based on its own credit experience in accordance with paragraph (p)(1) of this section, the system must be validated when sufficient credit experience becomes available. A system that fails this validity test is no longer an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system for that creditor. 

(q) Extend credit  and extension of credit mean the granting of credit in any form (including, but not limited to, credit granted in addition to any existing credit or credit limit; credit granted pursuant to an open-end credit plan; the refinancing or other renewal of credit, including the issuance of a new credit card in place of an expiring credit card or in substitution for an existing credit card; the consolidation of two or more obligations; or the continuance of existing credit without any special effort to collect at or after maturity). 

(r) Good faith  means honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction. 

(s) Inadvertent error  means a mechanical, electronic, or clerical error that a creditor demonstrates was not intentional and occurred notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such errors. 

(t) Judgmental system of evaluating applicants  means any system for evaluating the creditworthiness of an applicant other than an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system. 

(u) Marital status  means the state of being unmarried, married, or separated, as defined by applicable state law. The term unmarried includes persons who are single, divorced, or widowed. 

(v) Negative factor or value,  in relation to the age of elderly applicants, means utilizing a factor, value, or weight that is less favorable regarding elderly applicants than the creditor's experience warrants or is less favorable than the factor, value, or weight assigned to the class of applicants that are not classified as elderly and are most favored by a creditor on the basis of age. 

(w) Open-end credit  means credit extended under a plan in which a creditor may permit an applicant to make purchases or obtain loans from time to time directly from the creditor or indirectly by use of a credit card, check, or other device. 

(x) Person  means a natural person, corporation, government or governmental subdivision or agency, trust, estate, partnership, cooperative, or association. 

(y) Pertinent element of creditworthiness,  in relation to a judgmental system of evaluating applicants, means any information about applicants that a creditor obtains and considers and that has a demonstrable relationship to a determination of creditworthiness. 

(z) Prohibited basis  means race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age (provided that the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); the fact that all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program; or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act or any state law upon which an exemption has been granted by the Bureau. 

(aa) State  means any state, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any territory or possession of the United States.

delinquent
Primary tabs
The word delinquent may have several meanings for the law depending on the context, such as the following:

A natural person or entity failing to perform an obligation. For example, a tenant who is delinquent in rental payments or a corporation that is delinquent in loan repayments.
A natural person that is guilty of committing criminal conduct. For example, a juvenile delinquent that committed a crime.
An obligation past due or unperformed. For example, a delinquent tax.

fraud
Primary tabs
Fraud is both a civil tort and criminal wrong. 

In civil litigation, allegations of fraud might be based on a misrepresentation of fact that was either intentional or negligent.  For a statement to be an intentional misrepresentation, the person who made it must either have known the statement was false or been reckless as to its truth.  The speaker must have also intended that the person to whom the statement was made would rely on it.  The hearer must then have reasonably relied on the promise and also been harmed because of that reliance. 

A claim for fraud based on a negligent misrepresentation differs in that the speaker of the false statement may have actually believed it to be true; however, the speaker lacked reasonable grounds for that belief. 

A promise that goes unfulfilled may give rise to a claim for fraud only under particular circumstances.  For example, in California law, a false promise is only fraudulent if the promisor intended both not to perform on the promise and also that that the promisee would rely on the promise; and, the promisee must have reasonably relied on the promise and been harmed as a result of that reasonable reliance.  When the promise was made as part of a contract, most states forbid a plaintiff from recovering under both contract law and tort law.

Lastly, opinions are not usually actionable as fraud except under very specific circumstances defined by either the common law or statutes in each state.  In California, for example, a jury may be instructed that an opinion can be considered a representation of fact if it is proven that the speaker claimed to have special knowledge of the subject matter that the listener did not have; OR that the representation was made not in a casual expression of belief, but in a way that declared the matter to be true; OR if the speaker was in a position of trust and confidence over the listener; OR if the listener had some other special reason to expect the speaker to be reliable.  Once the jury decides that an opinion qualified as a misrepresentation of fact under the circumstances, the plaintiff must still demonstrate all of the other elements of an intentional or negligent misrepresentation already described, such as reasonable reliance and resulting harm.

In criminal law, fraud usually takes very specific forms, such as bankruptcy fraud, credit card fraud, or healthcare fraud. California law, for example, also recognizes distinct crimes for check fraud, access card fraud, insurance fraud, and making false financial statements.  Some criminal fraud statutes might be classified under laws forbidding larceny, others under forgery, and others as a crime covered by laws regarding a specific industry, like insurance or banking laws.  Suspicions of criminal fraud should be reported to law enforcement authorities.

deception
Primary tabs
Deception is the act of deliberately causing somebody to accept something as true that is not true. It is an action that hides the truth.  

Ohio defines deception as knowingly deceiving another or causing another to be deceived by any false or misleading representation, by withholding information, by preventing another from acquiring information, or by any other conduct, act, or omission that creates, confirms, or perpetuates a false impression in another, including a false impression as to law, value, state of mind, or other objective or subjective fact"""" in Section 2913.01 of its criminal code.

Some common uses of the term deception in a legal sense include:

In the context of theft by deception, cases such as this one from District of Columbia, explain that the term deception includes any act or communication made by the defendant which he knows to be untrue or false, including any misrepresentation as to the future, as well as the past or present.
In the context of statute prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices, cases such as this one from Florida, explain that deception occurs if there is a representation, omission, or practice that is likely to mislead the consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances, to the consumer's detriment.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NY","XXXXX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-01-06,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6406672,2023

Marcus offered an online account paying 3.3 percent. 
Two days later I received an email that there was a problem and they needed to speak to my mom who was diagnoses with XXXX and has no idea what is her current reality. 
She is currently in XXXX XXXX at an assisted living facility. The representative insisted that he must speak to her. I explained to him that I have a Power of Attorney as well as a note from her doctor explaining her XXXX  status. I offered to email him both in pdf format. 

He declined but did give me a mailing address where I could send them which I did. After a bit over a week of no contact I called them again and they confirmed receipt of the documents which had been sent to their legal department. They informed me that I will need to complete another form and have it notorized. Why did they not tell me this during the previous conversation when I got the mailing address to send the POA? Regardless, the representative told me that he would mail me the form which I never received. Today, a little over a week later I called again to mention that the form never arrived and the representative claimed that apparently the legal department was still evaluating my mailed in documents. Bottom of the pile???? Today I was told again that they would still require to speak to my mom. I explained, again, that the police confiscated my mom 's drivers license years ago deeming her to be too confused to be allowed to drive. I also mentioned that during my last visit with my mom she requested that I ask her brother to leave the room. Apparently they were playing cards and she was unhappy with how he was playing. Her brother died many years ago. 

It has now been a few days short of a month that they have held the funds and locked me out of the account. I told the representative that I was able to sell my mom 's house and arrange her health care using my current POA and explained that this situation is entirely not satisfactory to me and that once I jump through all of their required hoops and can access the account the first thing that I plan to do is close the account and send the funds back to the source account at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I no longer wish to do business with their bank and could she simply do that. She said that she could not. 

I explained to her that in order to file a complaint here or with XXXX XXXX regulators I must file an official complaint with her bank. I asked her if she can do that or if I should mail her a hard copy of the complaint. She said that she could do that. So here I am locked out of {$250000.00} which Marcus Bank should not have accepted from the beginning if the info provided to open it was insufficient.

I appreciate your attention to this issue and seek your assistance in resolving the situation. 

On XX/XX/2023, I accepted the payment presented by Goldman Sachs, considering it as an implicit agreement to the terms presented. I have evidence that I sent a second notice to Goldman Sachs on XX/XX/2023 seeking clarification, resolution and an opportunity to cure this matter. On XX/XX/2023 I sent a notice of dishonor and estoppel which I have all three letters and return receipts proving that Goldman Sachs received my correspondence. Unfortunately, I have not received any response from Goldman Sachs, leading me to believe that they have accepted the terms outlined in my letter. 

Despite this tacit agreement, I am now facing adverse actions from Goldman Sachs, particularly in their attempt to negatively impact my credit score. I find this action to be unjust and in violation of the understanding I had assumed through the acceptance of their payment. 

At your request I will provide copies of the relevant documents, including my letters to Goldman Sachs and any correspondence I have received from them. I kindly request that you investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate action to remedy the situation. 

I trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will act diligently to ensure fair and just resolution in this case. Please keep me informed about the progress of your investigation and any steps taken to address my concerns. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Most people, especially lower income people, don't even own printers anymore and/or can not meet Goldman Sachs Apple Card ridiculous timelines. To add insult to injury, after sending numerous documents to Goldman Sachs Apple Card and following up with them, they just claim that they never received them.

2023-06-30,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Closing an account","Funds not received from closed account","I, as power of attorney, opened an account in the name of my mom who is in XXXX XXXX with XXXX, XXXX XXXX. At the time I was not aware of, nor should I have been aware of, that banks rule that a new account for her can not be opened by myself. The concept was simple. The funds in her XXXX XXXX checking account were paying a fraction of one percent interest and marcus was paying XXXX percent interest which would have generated extra income to pay her medical bills which exceed her income from social security. Easy as pie to open the account, link the accounts, transfer the funds. Then I get an urgent email to contact marcus. I did so and they demanded to speak to XXXX. I clearly explained to the rep that she can't speak a cogent sentence and is in XXXX XXXX. At this point he could have initiated an account closure but maybe he was ignorant of that rule as I was? So they request my power of attorney, sent. The same one used to take over the XXXX XXXX account, sell mom 's house and car, and put her in XXXX XXXX somehow was not good enough for them so they blocked my account access. This was back in XX/XX/XXXX!!!! I file a complaint with CFPB, allegedly the bank regulator of Marcus. Marcus responded on XX/XX/XXXX about how my action of opening the account violated their rules and thus were closing the account and sending the funds to the original funding account and to please close the complaint. Pure and simple they lied to their regulator!!!!!!!! Then, on XX/XX/XXXX I receive an email confirming account closure. It took six weeks to close the account? That is not the problem. The problem is they kept the funds!!!! I repeatedly called their reps until I got one priceless response telling me that the account was indeed closed but the rep has no idea where the funds went!!! She said she would inform her manager who would call me back and of course he never did. Flash forward and I call again. This time I am told that I must call XXXX XXXX bank and they must solve it. I replied that I sent the funds and it is ridiculous to think that XXXX XXXX can simply reach out and take funds from marcus. Nonetheless I did call XXXX XXXX and they assured me that I was correct and the account remained in good standing and suggest that I """" file a police report ''. I planned to do that but thought that first I would give marcus one last chance to come clean. Mention of a police report did indeed get their attention and they spent some good time with me discussing the issue including confirming that they had the correct XXXX XXXX account information, which they did. Finally, they figured out what happened, that the funds were allegedly sent to the unclaimed funds dept in my state. Well guess what, I have dealt with them before because my mom 's condition caused her to let funds go dormant and I reclaimed them. A search revealed no such funds and indeed I even received an email reply from them stating the funds were not there. The marcus account number was XXXX and the XXXX XXXX  account number is XXXX. This fiasco has dragged on for over six months for no valid reason and the fact that marcus lied to CFPB, their regulator, can not be overstated!!!!! I am going to once again request marcus to do an internal audit and figure out which thief or incompetent worker stole my mom 's funds. It boggles my mind how CFPB, a government agency, can't get legal authorities to investigate this fraudulent or incompetent banking institution. I am aware of actions of retaliation that have been taken against me and I am just a XXXX and goldman sachs is a whale but I still have a few cards left to play. Ignore this at your own peril marcus, of course via legal actions.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","FL","XXXXX","Older American","Consent provided","Web",2023-06-30,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7188061,2023

Then, Marcus by Goldman Sachs Bank called me the next day and told me that they were rejecting my transfer request without any reasonable explanation why. 

Then, Marcus by Goldman Sachs Bank transferred the funds anyway, but because they told me that they had rejected the transfer, I don't dare attempt to access those funds at the external bank. 

Based on this experience, I would strongly recommend that no one do business at or with Marcus by Goldman Sachs Bank.

Access to the new accounts was subsequently locked, in their yet unfunded state. 
Any security concerns have been acknowledged as cleared by the Bank, as of XX/XX/2023. Quite likely sooner, as the completed affidavit was returned on XX/XX/2023. ( See attached documentation for details. ) The status of these deposits is still in limbo, even though the Bank acknowledged receipt of the funds, and placement in their respective accounts, via XXXX correspondence indicating ( XX/XX/2023. ) XXXX account remains open, showing XXXX balance ( OSA. ) The other, an XXXX month XXXX of XXXX was subsequently closed, flagged as """" unfunded. '' ( Email dated : XX/XX/2023. ) Furthermore, after much research, it appears this is a recurrent method of operation, with unsuspecting customers. ( a.k.a., victims. ) Withholding deposits, locking account access, or otherwise stalling using XXXX XXXX in conjunction with """" terms of service '' effectively lowers the XXXX, as advertised. This basically wipes out any monetary advantage gained by depositing funds with XXXX, versus their competitors. 
In simplest terms, I've been """" screwed '' out of approximately XXXX week 's interest, even though the Bank has agreed to credit my ( XXXX ) cashier 's checks into the remaining account, if I CONTINUE TO WAIT. For what?? 
A somewhat less than equitable solution to my dilemma would be for the Bank to IMMEDIATELY credit the afore-mentioned funds, in their entirety, to the remaining OSA. 
Immediately means today, rather than XXXX to XXXX more days, yet again. 
Otherwise, the sum of my funds should be PROMPTLY returned via Bank check, to the address on file, which was provided when the accounts were originally opened. 
Promptly, means I will not find it necessary to place XXXX fruitless calls to """" Customer Service, '' or file another complaint with the Regulators. 
No more perpetual loops of """" Call, Wait & Repeat. '' Most average citizens like myself, can not endure the stress, suspected loss, or forfeiture of their life 's savings over these unnecessary hijinks. 
In what reality does it take over XXXX weeks to make a simple deposit into a savings account?? 
Also, do not attempt to purport that the Bank reached out via phone call, or email without response, to retroactively justify the delays. 
Please take time to review the attached documentation, as it will provide the information relevant to the accounts.

I am very upset that not only could this have caused damage to my credit rating, but that they can not find ANY evidence that I scheduled the transfer in spite of the fact that I have a printed confirmation with the date and time I scheduled it ( and a very long confirmation number ) and the fact that I received an email confirmation within 1 minute of scheduling the transfer. 

I was told I could only write a letter ( which I have done ) to have fees reimbursed and mail it via USPS. They have no means of of emailing or uploading my confirmation and email. In addition, my letter requests a thorough investigation into this matter. 

I believe that Marcus by Goldman Sachs has something wrong in their system that cause a transfer not to go through. I feel certain I am NOT the only person to whom this has happened and I feel a full investigation needs to be launched to determine what happened and why the transfer did not take place ; as well as what happened in order to correct the matter. As a XXXX XXXX in the XXXX XXXX I am quite upset at the poor customer service and handling of this matter, ESPECIALLY in light of the fact that they can not locate a transfer THEY CONFIRMED VIA EMAIL!!!! 

I am also very concerned with the poor attitude of all 6 staff members and their 'inability ' to launch a more thorough investigation. This is an online savings account that they advertise the ability to make a {$100000.00} same-day transfer to external banks, yet they couldn't do it with over 3 weeks notice. 

I have filed a complaint with the Federal Reserve but was referred to the CFPB for further action.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","VA","23322","","Consent provided","Web",2023-10-09,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7668865,2023

GSBANK is in violation of multiple laws set forth by Congress in regards to the following account # XXXX. The Fair Credit Reporting Act, to be more specific, 15 U.S. Code 1681a ( 2 ) ( a ) ( i ) states that the consumer report does not include information solely as to transactions or experiences ( payment history, charge off status ), between the consumer ( myself ) and the person ( GSBANK ) making the report. Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681 s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) states that A person ( GSBANK ) shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer ( ME ) to any consumer reporting agency ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. GSBANK can not collect on a discharged debt. This is now considered a certificate of indebtedness per the IRS and income can not be reported. 

The IRS Clearly defines a charge off as Gross or Ordinary income, INCOME DOES NOT GET REPORTED ON THE CONSUMER REPORT which in fact makes reporting of this account inaccurate! I provided a screenshot from the IRS website for further evidence. By Definition, the IRS Clearly says a Cancelled debt or Charge off is Income. The reporting of this account as a debt is inaccurate. I never received a 1099-C from GSBANK for the cancelled debt of { {$3300.00} } in order to file as ordinary income. Where is my 1099-C GSBANK is clearly writing off debt with the IRS without sending out 1099-C as required by the IRS for debts greater than { {$600.00} }. Because of this I will report your agency to the IRS for tax fraud via the Form 3949-A form. GSBANK has been HEREBY PUT ON NOTICE that they are furnishing incorrect inaccurate information. In GSBANK terms and conditions they agreed not to share my information with non affiliates. XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX is not an affiliate of GSBANK nor are they """" bureaus ''. The only true credit bureau is the CFPB and they DO NOT furnish consumer reports as stated in federal law. If this company truly believe otherwise then I demand that they prove to me and the cfpb that XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX are """" Bureaus '' as federal law describes it. I have a right to privacy and Per the Privacy Act of XXXX as a federally protected consumer I am now revoking any and all authorization I the consumer may have given you written, non written, verbal, and nonverbal per 5 U.S. Code 552a. Per the FCRA as a federally protected consumer I am now opting out of any and all authorization I the consumer may have given you written, non written, verbal, and non verbal per 15 USC 6802.

I shall also point out their responsibility pursuant 15 U.S. Code section 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) ( ii ) : ( a ) DUTY OF FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION TO PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION 1 ) PROHIBITION ( B ) Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if ( i ) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate ; and ( ii ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. 


GSBANK must also refund the remaining balance of the consumer account upon its termination. This is your 7 day notice to return ALL money due from this consumer account. XXXX Treatment of credit balances ; account termination. ( a ) Credit balances. When a credit balance in excess of { {$1.00} } is created on a credit account ( through transmittal of funds to a creditor in excess of the total balance due on an account, through rebates of unearned finance charges or insurance premiums, or through amounts otherwise owed to or held for the benefit of the consumer ), the creditor shall : ( 1 ) Credit the amount of the credit balance to the consumer 's account ; ( 2 ) Refund any part of the remaining credit balance within seven business days from receipt of a written request from the consumer ; ( 3 ) Make a good faith effort to refund to the consumer by cash, check, or money order, or credit to a deposit account of the consumer, any part of the credit balance remaining in the account for more than six months. No further action is required if the consumer 's current location is not known to the creditor and can not be traced through the consumer 's last known address or telephone number. ( b ) Account termination. ( 1 ) A creditor shall not terminate an account prior to its expiration date solely because the consumer does not incur a finance charge. ( 2 ) Nothing in paragraph ( b ) ( 1 ) of this section prohibits a creditor from terminating an account that is inactive for three or more consecutive months. An account is inactive for purposes of this paragraph if no credit has been extended ( such as by purchase, cash advance or balance transfer ) and if the account has no outstanding balance. ( c ) Timely settlement of estate debts ( 1 ) General rule. ( i ) Reasonable policies and procedures required. For credit card accounts under an open-end ( not home-secured ) consumer credit plan, card issuers must adopt reasonable written policies and procedures designed to ensure that an administrator of an estate of a deceased accountholder can determine the amount of and pay any balance on the account in a timely manner. ( ii ) Application to joint accounts. Paragraph ( c ) of this section does not apply to the account of a deceased consumer if a joint accountholder remains on the account. ( 2 ) Timely statement of balance ( i ) Requirement. Upon request by the administrator of an estate, a card issuer must provide the administrator with the amount of the balance on a deceased consumer 's account in a timely manner. ( ii ) Safe harbor. For purposes of paragraph ( c ) ( 2 ) ( i ) of this section, providing the amount of the balance on the account within 30 days of receiving the request is deemed to be timely. ( 3 ) Limitations after receipt of request from administrator ( i ) Limitation on fees and increases in annual percentage rates. After receiving a request from the administrator of an estate for the amount of the balance on a deceased consumer 's account, a card issuer must not impose any fees on the account ( such as a late fee, annual fee, or over-the-limit fee ) or increase any annual percentage rate, except as provided by 1026.55 ( b ) ( 2 ). ( ii ) Limitation on trailing or residual interest. A card issuer must waive or rebate any additional finance charge due to a periodic interest rate if payment in full of the balance disclosed pursuant to paragraph ( c ) ( 2 ) of this section is received within 30 days after disclosure.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","PA","187XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-11-22,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7893535,2023

Specifically, my Apple GS credit card is falsely reporting that I was 30 days late in XX/XX/XXXX. I want to emphasize that this information is completely untrue, as I made the payment on time, despite being ill with XXXX during that period. Moreover, this error occurred during a time when we were in a state of a public health emergency due to the pandemic. 

The impact of this erroneous reporting has been profound and deeply personal. This is the only card on my credit report that shows a 30-day late payment, and it has adversely affected my financial standing. I have always maintained a stellar payment history, never having been late on any payment. However, this inaccurate reporting has led to the denial of credit and imposition of higher interest rates, causing significant financial distress. 

I have made multiple attempts to rectify this issue before resorting to filing this complaint. I reached out to the creditor directly on three separate occasions and contacted the credit reporting agencies multiple times to dispute the erroneous information. Regrettably, every response I received from the credit reporting agencies simply stated that the information was verified, without providing any evidence to substantiate their claim. Their negligent handling of my case and failure to assist me have left me with no choice but to escalate the matter by filing this complaint with the CFPB. 

I would like to bring to your attention the provisions outlined in 15 USC 1681 S2, specifically ( F ), which addresses reporting information during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to this section, """" accommodation '' includes any assistance or relief granted to a consumer affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The """" covered period '' mentioned in the same section is defined as the period beginning on XX/XX/XXXX, and ending 120 days after the termination of the national emergency declared by the XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, under the National Emergencies Act. 

Considering that the COVID-19 public health emergency ended on XX/XX/XXXX, I am still within the covered period as defined by the aforementioned statute. I have been reluctant to file a complaint, but both the creditor and credit reporting agencies have violated my rights as a consumer and shown negligence in their handling of my case. I have patiently sought resolution for nearly six months without any meaningful assistance, which has left me with no alternative but to seek your intervention and guidance. 

Therefore, my desired outcome is for the creditor, as well as the credit reporting agencies involved, to promptly correct the reporting error on all my credit reports. Specifically, I request that the 30-day late payment be amended to """" paid as agreed, '' as this is my right as a consumer under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a swift resolution. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information or documentation. 

Thank you for your assistance in this regard.

When I scheduled the transfer, a message popped up and asked me why I am transferring that amount of money. I answer a question, but I just thought it was a customer survey. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a call asking to call back the bank XXXX. 

I called back, and they told me that they wanted to be sure that it was me that Initiated the transfer. 

The strange part is that the transfer was done to my own XXXX account, so the activity was not suspicious or fraudulent. 

Then I asked them to explain the reason for suspending the transfer and they gave XXXX contradicting answers. 

1. They have concerns that the transaction was fraudulent ( however they later acknowledge that I was transferring the money to the originating account ). 

2. They generally want to keep the money for XXXX days in the savings account ( which is stranger, as I needed the money for paying the school of my children and it was not a certificate of deposit ) 3. Finally, the most disturbing thing, that according to the savings agreement they reserve the right to block withdrawals from my account. I read the agreement and that statement was right. But it was not clearly disclosed to the customer. Moreover, the bank does not discloses the amount to be block from being withdrawal. 

I just want to file a complaint against XXXX Goldman Sachs for preventing the customer to access their funds on timely manner. Blocking transfers to originating accounts are just an excuse to retain funds at the bank. This is not the standard practice of banks. I transferred money in the past between my accounts and this is the first time that my transaction is blocked by a bank based on security reasons ( I am not sure how suspicious is a transfer of money between my own accounts ). 

This is reducing the quality of the service ( timely availability of funds ) which is standard to any savings account. 

Also I want to complain on the time duration for transfers to my XXXX account. The XXXX transfer takes up to XXXX days. But the money is frozen for XXXX  days. The bank is holding the money at the expense of the customer. They should make the money available after the XXXX transfer is completed and not holding the money in excess of that time. They currently hold the money for an extra XXXX days.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","DC","20008","","Consent provided","Web",2023-06-11,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7098092,2023

I was told I would receive the missing {$140.00} but I never did. So I contacted Goldman on XX/XX/2022, to initiate a dispute with Apple. Goldman issued temporary credits for {$97.00} and {$43.00} which totals {$140.00}. And Apple issued the {$140.00} refund also on the same day Goldman initiated the dispute. The problem is Goldman reversed the temporary credits and then wrongly rebilled me for the same {$140.00} that Apple refunded. Additionally, they have wrongly reported the account as 150 days delinquent to the credit bureaus. I am requesting this account to be closed and both the billing and credit report corrected to reflect a zero balance.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","GA","302XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-06-09,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7094896,2023

Today I spoke with a different resource at Goldman Sachs, first name 'XXXX XXXX, and he indicates the terms have changed and they have no way to restore them to the original agreement. I share this fact with the CFPB for information, as I believe changing the terms of this agreement is likely in violation of any number of Federal regulations, but Goldman Sachs is unwilling or unable to restore my original terms. I doubt that fact is likely to change in response to this complaint. The sum total of all of these issues have consumed countless hours of my time and based on my reading through public complaints in the database it would appear very probable that I am not the only consumer adversely affected by Goldman 's many issues with this product.

I had bought a {$240.00} XXXX gift card online. The transaction as approved a couple of days later and I subsequently paid off the card. The vendor never sent the proper gift card and it was very difficult to get a hold of them. I opened a transaction dispute through the Apple  Card for that {$240.00} transaction and provided them with all the details, along with screen shots of the emails, etc. 

Once the transaction was opened, I was provided with a 'provisional credit ' of {$240.00}. This did not add any credit my account at all. When I asked XXXX through their XXXX chat message, they said that the temporary credit will not increase the available credit and that it is in place so that I am not responsible for the charge during the dispute. I asked them """" So I am still out of pocket the {$240.00}? '' And they said """" The {$240.00} is not available as credit, that is correct. '' That is frustrating, but I accepted it. 

About 5 days after the dispute was opened, the vendor provided a refund to my account in the amount of {$240.00}. I contacted apple to let them know that they can cancel the dispute because I received the refund. When the refund came through, I had a balance of {$35.00} on my card. So the end balance on my card that day was + {$210.00}. I wake up the following day to see that my card balance was + {$140.00}. No additional transactions were on the card. I contacted Apple Card to see what happened, and they could not tell me. I provided screen shots of everything. I had to open a dispute for the missing {$61.00} on my account. They also told me to mail in a letter dispute. So XXXX has already taken {$61.00} from me then. 

Less than a week later, XXXX was able to close the dispute finally. Except when they close it, they add {$240.00} to my Apple  Card balance. They say that it is because they gave me a credit before and that my dispute has been resolved. As stated earlier, XXXX never provided me with a + {$240.00} credit. This was also recorded and confirmed by an XXXX employee in XXXX chat. I have plenty of screenshots to confirm the conversations of why with the XXXX employee. When I was speaking to XXXX, they kept repeating the same thing that it was for the 'credit ' they gave me, despite me showing them definitive proof, from their own employee, that it did not happen. I was finally able to speak with someone ( over chat again because no one would give me a phone number to call ) who submitted a dispute and made notes in my file. They told me it could be XXXX billing cycles and abruptly ended the chat. 

Now I am stuck with over {$300.00} of charges in my account that will accrue interest until XXXX makes a determination. I refuse to pay it off, because the last time I paid off a charge that I disputed, I ended up paying more. 

I loved Apple Card for the points, but I wish I had never opened a dispute. If I had never opened a dispute, AND the vendor never issued a refund, it still wouldn't cost me as much has it has from opening a dispute with Apple Card.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","IL","60630","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-05,"Closed with non-monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7949680,2023

2023-06-05,"Checking or savings account","CD (Certificate of Deposit)","Managing an account","Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed","I tried to resolve the complaint with Marcus by Golden Sachs itself before I submitted the complaint to CFPB. However, I did not receive Golden Sachs callback as its agent promised. This is the reason why I submitted the complaint to CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  holiday, Golden Sachs called me back and disguised itself as it was addressing my CFPB complaint. 

According to my knowledge, they should respond to me through CFPB account. So I asked the agent what was my proposed solution. He just mentioned one of them, and told me that my request was denied. I questioned him what the other two proposed solutions I mentioned in CFPB complaints. He was unable to answer and transferred the conversation to his so-called supervisor. 

However, he recognized himself as the supervisor agent and his level is the highest level I could speak over phone. How can he transfer our conversation to his supervisor and have his supervisor talk with me? 

The processing way of Golden Sachs makes me feel they are trying every effort to fool customer and make customer accept their unreasonable solution. I have spoken to about 8 agents of Golden Sachs. Every time when the first agent can not solve my problem, the first one transferred the communication to the supervisor. Then the supervisor still had no authorization to solve the problem. The supervisor said a higher-level supervisor would call me back. But no one called me after their first-time promise. I called them again, they said they requested again. I confirmed and double check with the supervisor that I could speak to supervisors supervisor who have larger authorization during the callback. However, I received three callbacks but every time the three agents recognized themselves as the same level as the supervisor I talked to over the phone last time, no supervisors supervisor. 

Until last week, the agent disguised itself as responding to CFPB complaint, which made me frustrated and scared that Golden Sachs was such a big brand that they are lying all the time. 

I feel it is necessary to report their dishonest behaviors. Therefore I am writing to you, CFPB members, to ask you to investigate Golden Sachs to see if they disguise themselves as government agency to fool customers, as well as if they pretend to solve problems by just kick balls to other so-called supervisor agent, which is actually not a supervisor to defraud and play games with customers.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","FL","33543","","Consent provided","Web",2023-06-05,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7073771,2023

I've been a Marcus customer for years, and I thought everything was fine until recently. It turns out Marcus has a major flaw that many others have complained about -- it's nearly impossible to get your money out when you need it. Whether it's through ACH transfers or wire transfers, you're left without access to your own savings account for days or even weeks. 

Here 's what happened to me : I needed to transfer funds ( $ XXXX ) for a mortgage escrow downpayment, and Marcus locked me out of my account. To make matters worse, it froze all my linked accounts at other banks too. I spent hours on the phone with both Marcus and my other banks, trying to unlock everything, but I still don't have full access to my funds. It was absolutely terrifying not being able to access my own money when I needed it, not just with Marcus but also with the other banks that were linked to it. 

And let 's not even talk about their so-called """" same day '' wire transfers. I called them multiple times, asking if they needed more verification, and they said they would expedite the transfer. But the transfer never went through. Every time I called, they lied about it being expedited and promised it would be done by the end of the day. I wasted so much time on the phone, listening to their empty promises. 

This is supposed to be a liquid savings account. They shouldn't have the power to lock you out of all your accounts, even after you've proven your identity. Their rates are competitive, but if you actually need your money for something important, Marcus is the last place you should keep it. 

I'm hoping you can help me with the following : 1. Look into Marcus and their policies on fund accessibility and the impact on linked accounts. 
2. Make sure I can access my funds and restore full control over my accounts. 
3. Hold Marcus accountable for their false claims about """" same day '' wire transfers. 
4. Get fair compensation for the stress, time, and trouble this has caused me. 

I believe that by bringing this issue to your attention, we can find a resolution and prevent others from going through the same ordeal. I look forward to your response and hope for a resolution that can bring me and others relief.

Upon noticing the charge, I promptly called Goldman Sachs and notified them, and they temporarily credited the charge to my account.

I asked Goldman for rationale behind why they denied covering my fraudulent charge and they provided information from the merchant, but this fails to show that I made the charge - I didn't and it was unauthorized. From what they told me, this transaction was not in person, and someone stole both my credit card info and personal information. I appealed this decision, and Goldman took a few months to investigate, however they reversed their decision, making me liable for the unauthorized charge notifying me of this decision on XX/XX/XXXX. They asked me for evidence that I didn't authorize the charge, but if the charge is unauthorized and fraudulent, how would I have evidence that it's a charge that I didn't make? That makes absolutely no sense. Upon that appeal, I'm writing to the CFPB. A credit card company should cover unauthorized and fraudulent charges on consumer accounts, and Goldman Sachs has failed to do this.

I am writing to bring to your attention a serious matter regarding the reporting of late payments on my account. It has come to my attention that the late payments you have reported to the credit bureaus are in direct violation of the provisions outlined in the United States Code, specifically 15 USC 6802.

According to 15 USC 6802, it is illegal to report inaccurate or incomplete information to credit bureaus. Furthermore, Section 15 USC 6802 ( b ) explicitly prohibits the disclosure of non-public personal information without the consent of the individual concerned. In light of this, your disclosure of my account 's experience or transaction information to the credit bureaus, who are non-affiliated third parties, also violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

Upon reviewing my credit report, I have discovered that your company has incorrectly reported late payments for my account. This incorrect reporting has had a significantly negative impact on my credit score and overall creditworthiness. Not only is this a violation of 15 USC 6802, but it also contravenes the FCRA, which mandates the accurate reporting of credit information by creditors.

In accordance with the aforementioned legal provisions, I hereby demand that you immediately update the status of my account with the credit bureaus to """" paid as agreed '' within four business days from the date of this letter. Failure to comply with this demand will leave me no choice but to pursue legal action against Apple Card for each violation under 15 USC 6802 and the FCRA. Please Note : Company policy does not supersede federal law.

Please be advised that if I am forced to take legal action, I will seek damages of {$1000.00} per violation, as provided for by the United States Code and the FCRA. I strongly believe that the accurate reporting of my account 's status will rectify the damage caused by your company 's incorrect reporting and restore my credit profile to its rightful state.

To ensure a prompt resolution, I kindly request that you acknowledge this letter within five business days and provide written confirmation of your commitment to rectify the reporting errors. Additionally, I expect written confirmation from the credit bureaus regarding the updated status of my account within ten business days.

I trust that Apple Card, as a reputable financial institution, will handle this matter with utmost urgency and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. I hope we can resolve this matter amicably without resorting to legal measures.

The flight to XXXX from XXXX was booked through a third party XXXX and canceled the day of on XX/XX/XXXX just minutes before I was supposed to board. XXXX could not offer me a refund for the canceled flight since I booked through a third party and therefore it was the merchants ( third partys ) responsibility to provide said refund. The merchant refused to provide a refund and threatened legal action if a chargeback was performed. Despite the threat, I disputed the transaction as goods and services not received. 

Yet, Apple Card and Goldman Sachs have repeatedly denied my dispute and reapplied the charges to the account. Under United States law and as specified by the Department of Transportation, I am entitled to a refund if a flight is canceled. 

I am asking for assistance from the CFPB to help me win this ongoing dispute. 

The evidence I have - Evidence that I booked the XXXX tickets through XXXX An email that my flight out of XXXX was canceled. 
Evidence that my itinerary was canceled Timeline - Apple Card has done multiple """" internal reviews '' and the case has been ruled against my favor each time. When calling and or chatting with Apple Card Specialist at Goldman Sachs, they are unable to provide any reason as to why it was ruled in the merchants favor. I have requested from merchant evidence, but have not received any despite asking for it twice now. 

My suspicion is that the merchant is either submitting false information or doctored evidence as they have a history of sleazy business practices ( more on that below ) or the Apple Card team at Goldman Sachs is simply refusing to acknowledge my evidence. The merchant has also been harassing me continuously with phone calls telling me to cancel the disputes. 

There is a severe problem that not only am I not winning these disputes, I am wasting my time re-disputing the charge. The merchant has a long history of shady business practices and stealing money from customers and Apple refuses to protect its customers from merchants acting in bad faith. 

Since my initial dispute on XX/XX/XXXX, I have since disputed the charge an additional 3 times.

Despite resubmitting the evidence- my claim was once again denied. The only thing the email said was that I did not have enough evidence to substantiate the claim which is simply false. 

XXXX Dispute on XX/XX/XXXX ( Case Number : XXXX ) Once again, when my claim was denied, I immediately tried to contact Apple to resubmit the dispute and expressed my concern that my claim kept getting denied. 
I was able to get the charge redisputed. 

Despite this, I once again lost my dispute on XX/XX/XXXX.

2023-10-20,"Credit card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Trouble using your card","Credit card company won't increase or decrease your credit limit","On XX/XX/XXXX, I was surprised to discover that Apple Card had decreased my credit limit without any prior notice. The company insist I was notified by email prior but as of XX/XX/XXXX I have still yet to receive any correspondence from Apple Card. I have requested the company submit documentation verifying prior notice was communicated which they have refused. In speaking with a Apple Card Specialist I was advised this action was taken in response to a charged-off account that was reported to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I want to emphasize that I have maintained a strong payment history with Apple Card, never missing payments, and consistently paying more than my minimum required balance. 

The sudden reduction in my credit limit not only caught me off guard but has also posed financial challenges. This reduction could potentially lead to an increase in my credit utilization, which, in turn, may adversely affect my credit score. The domino effect of a lower credit score could lead other lenders to perceive an increased risk and subsequently lower the limits on my other credit cards. This situation is a cause for concern as it can have lasting consequences on my financial health.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","TX","770XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-10-20,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7731690,2023

On XX/XX/2023, I tried withdrawing {$4000.00}. The amount was deducted from my available balance and shows on my account as """" In Progress, '' has remained as such for over 10 days now. The account says withdrawals should take 1-3 business days, but this is taking much longer. 

On XX/XX/2023, I missed a call from Goldman Sachs. They didn't give any details except to call them back. I called them back later that day, and the agent couldn't tell me what the missed call was about. I asked about the {$4000.00} withdrawal still showing pending, and I was transferred 3 times over 30 minutes before I was told that they need to verify my identity before they can release the funds. They then said they couldn't send a verification PIN to my phone because their system says my phone is inactive, even though I'm currently speaking to them on that same phone. They said they'll submit an internal request to review the transaction and the call ended. 

On XX/XX/2023, I called support again. I was on the phone with them for 14 minutes, and then they dropped the call. I called again, was transferred yet again, and this time they said the withdrawal is on hold due to security review, even though I received no notice and it doesn't show as such on my end. Once again, they said they need to verify my identity via one-time phone PIN, and then said they can't because my number is inactive, even though - again - I'm calling on that same phone. I asked if there's any other way to verify and they said no. They said to call XXXX XXXX XXXX to make my number active, even though I'm literally speaking to them on the same phone, and have had no issues with one-time code messages in the past. Again, they said they'll have to do a manual review. They said it can take 24-48 hours, and they may decide to deny the withdrawal. 

Meanwhile there is nothing I can do, and presumably the money I withdrew isn't accumulating interest, nor do I have access to it, with no reasonable way to solve the problem.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NY","10002","","Consent provided","Web",2023-05-25,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7029344,2023

2023-07-18,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Managing an account","Deposits and withdrawals","On XX/XX/, I opened an Apple-Goldman Sachs savings acct XXXX using the apple wallet. I transferred money from my apple cash. 

In the agreement, and even written in big letters on the app, is that the money is available for withdrawal at anytime. 

However, when I tried to withdrawal funds on XX/XX/XXXX - back to my apple cash it was repeated declined. 

When I called to inquire, I was told that they money was subject to """" transfer delays '' and that these """" transfer delays '' may last for up to 90 days. When I asked her to define """" transfer delays '' she couldn't. I objected, '' and stated that this was in violation of the contract, and also in violation of what is explicitly written on the app.. the XXXX  agent told me that they could always return the money immediately to where it was deposited from. When I said, that is what I was trying to do, she blamed the delay on apple, and would not provide further explanations. 

In the end, they would not make the funds available as the advertising promised. So I simply initiated a 100 % withdrawal of funds with instruction to wire transfer to my physical bank. Then, several days later, the money was at last deposited into my funds. 

I told XXXX that I would be reporting this fraudulent activity on their part. As well I told them that this may include joining a class action suit - as it seems that many persons were complaining online of a similar negative experience of GS not allowing withdrawals, despite the clear adverising of """" funds available for withdrawal anytime. '' Then, today XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email informing me of an """" Update to our Account Terms '' that now has a clause that says """" We reserve the right to require you to notify us in writing seven days before a withdrawal is made from your Account. '' It also now says, """" We may restrict your access or use of your Account, or close your Account, at any time and for any reason, without notice or consent '' It also now states, """" Claims may be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis ONLY. Claims subject to this arbitration provision may NOT be joined or consolidated in arbitration with any Claim of any other person or be arbitrated on a class basis ... '' As well as, the updated account agreement says, """" We may use the funds in your Account to cover any : XXXX '' and """" You agree that we may respond to any such legal process in our own discretion without regard to jurisdiction. '' And """" Regardless of the terms of any legal process, we have first claim to any funds in your Account '' and """" We are not required to accept or execute any Apple Cash Transfer instruction. '' It is crystal clear that they could not abide by the original terms of their advertised services that were in place when the account was opened. So they have now gone back and modified them with absolutely unacceptable terms.

This is beyond infuriating and quite common as of late. There are hundreds of Apple XXXX clients who are in the same position as myself, but with much larger amounts stuck in limbowhich is why I was reluctant to place all of my money within this institution.

After multiple verification calls and discussions with all different representatives, we were advised that we should initiate the closure of the joint account in order for me to get the quickest access to my personal account. In order to do so, we would have to move the funds out of the joint account which we agreed to do so but then they blocked the transfer out for no reason. I had called again, initiated another transfer, confirmed next day with a Marcus rep that it went through but it never showed up in my external account so gave them yet another call and again they blocked the funds going out of the account for no apparent reason. At one point the representative switched the account numbers and tried to withdraw funds from my external bank instead of sending funds there which cased another delay on the funds coming out because as Marcus claim it, they saw that I stopped the wrong transfer so they cancelled the correct one too despite the rep telling me all went through when I called to confirm the next day. I'm now a week with out access to my funds, all the bank representatives tell me different things on why the transfers apparently can not come through and why I'm unable to close the account and get access to my second personal account where I hold all of my life savings, just being more time to hold my funds despite me calling daily and trying to get access to at least see my account.

The event was scheduled to take place on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, XXXX. The tickets were purchased from the vendor XXXX, XXXX # XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX sent an email stating that the event was no longer taking place at the scheduled date and time that was originally agreed upon. Since XXXX 's actions resulted in me not being able to attend the event at the original agreed upon date and time, I attempted to reach the vendor numerous times requesting a refund since services requested were not rendered. Each time I attempted to contact them, I encountered issues in trying to reach someone. 

Eventually when I did reach someone, I was told that the difficulty in trying to contact the vendor was due to staffing issues. XXXX also stated that any changes, including refunds would not be able to be requested or processed until completion of their modification ( rescheduling of the event ) which resulted in waiting months to be able to address my issue. Regardless of the the new date the event would be rescheduled, I would not have been able to attend due to not being available as I did not reside in the area and XXXX was informed of this. Eventually, I was informed by XXXX that my case would be escalated to their appropriate team to resolve this issue and that contact would only be made via email. However, to this date, I have not received any email from XXXX regarding the escalation of my case or processing of my refund. After many attempts of contacting XXXX and trying to resolve the issue with them, I eventually reached to the creditor, Goldman Sachs, to dispute the charge. 

Since the original services that were agreed upon were not rendered and any modifications to the terms were not agreed to nor addressed, a dispute of the charge in the amount of {$240.00} was initiated. Goldman Sachs has since refused to honor the dispute several times claiming that there is """" no evidence to substantiate the claim ''. However, I have provided Goldman Sachs with substantial evidence of the communication provided by XXXX that verifies my claim. The evidence is attached here and can be verified by XXXX. 

Here is the text version of the email communication received from XXXX. If needed, this email can be forwarded to any addressee in order to verify this communication 's validity of originating from XXXX 's server.

2023-05-18,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Managing an account","Deposits and withdrawals","On XX/XX/XXXX, I initiated a transaction of {$14000.00} from my Marcus account to my own XXXX checking account. I needed my money to arrive by XX/XX/XXXX in my XXXX  account. On transfer Marcus said it would take 1-3 business days to transfer my money. So I had one buffer day as XX/XX/XXXX would be the third business day. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Marcus locked me out of my account. They made their first communication attempt to me on XX/XX/XXXX but since I am out of the country I could not take the call. I have been trying to reach out to them since XX/XX/XXXX. I have called them 4-5 times total but they did not provide any resolution. They told me they will call me. Since I am out of US, they said they cant unlock my account because they cant reach to me on my number. I told them to contact me on my email or alternate phone number but they said to me to give them a call back when I am back in US. When I told them I am filing a complaint on CFPB, they gave me a call back right away on my alternate number. The agent told me that I can withdraw money to my funding account only, to withdraw money to my non-funding account I need to wait for 90 days. I had used my XXXX account to fund about {$9700.00} and the one of the other funding account was XXXX. I had closed my funding account ( XXXX  ) when I transferred my money to Marcus so essentially I have my money locked with Marcus for 90 days. 

XXXX told me that according to their deposit agreement ( Section VI : Deposits and Withdrawals. Subsection XXXX ) they XXXX place limits to my withdrawal and they will let me know of such limits at the time of scheduling my XXXX transfer. 

heir first attempt of communication from XXXX was made on XX/XX/XXXX and I scheduled my XXXX transfer on XX/XX/XXXX. So they XXXX have take at least XXXX day to try to communicate the limit. I did not get to know about this limit till XX/XX/XXXX when I called them back. There is a violation of the agreement I should have been told on XX/XX/XXXX itself about the limit. On confronting them about this they told me that they needed time to research about this. 

So at the end of the day I am not allowed to use my OWN hard earned money. I do not have freedom to withdraw my money to my own accounts and XXXX comes up with random restrictions on withdrawals and they violate the deposit agreement causing trauma to me. I have spent about XXXX hours on phone with their agents to get money moving from my account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, they allowed me to withdraw {$9700.00} to my XXXX account saying that this was the cumulative amount that came from XXXX to XXXX, so they can let me withdraw only that much and it should reach to my chase account in XXXX XXXX business days. I have to deal with the uncertainty of getting money into my account by XX/XX/XXXX. And even if I do get {$9700.00}, I have to manage {$5000.00} ( $ XXXX {$9700.00} ) in my XXXX account to avoid the loss of {$600.00}. On top of that XXXX XXXX not pay me the interest on {$14000.00} from XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX as they kept my money on hold. 

This is a pathetic display of financial service by XXXX causing trauma to its customers. Strict action should be taken against them.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","CA","94086","","Consent provided","Web",2023-05-18,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6993262,2023

I called Goldman Sachs about the closure and they confirmed the account was indeed closed. I explained that that there must have been a mistake, as i couldn't have done anything that violated the user agreement. I even reread the Apple Card user agreement and could not find anything that would cause the closure. I then asked what terms in the agreement was violated. They responded that they have no way of telling as the only thing they could see was what was in the closure email. For the last 06 months I've been escalating the issue through Goldman Sachs to figure out why my account was closed. I was told something different by almost every representative. I was told to that my profile was in good standing and should just reapply. I would try to reapply from my Apple ID only to find the application showing an error. Then i was told to just reapply from a different Apple ID. When i applied with a new Apple ID, the application no longer showed as error. After submitting the application, it would sit in a review state for 15+ days before i would receive an email denying my application """" due to system error ''. I was then told to wait 30 days, then 90 days, then 180 days. All the representatives telling me that I shouldn't be getting any of the error and my Apple ID is in good standing. Still nobody can tell me what terms were actually violated. On around XX/XX/2023, i received a call from a Goldman Sachs manager stating that they have done a through investigation on why i was having problems reapplying. She said they didn't find anything that could cause this issue on their end. She then states that my Apple ID is actually """" Not '' eligible to reapply a the moment despite what every other prior representative have have stated. She then states that she also can't see what terns were violated and to keep randomly applying and the system will decide """" when '' or """" if '' it will let the application go through and that the matter is now closed. I then asked for a copy my account transcripts to review. She said that she could put in a request but it would be up to Goldman Sachs whether the company want to give it to me.

So I contacted apple and the payment was cancelled, I then paid the balance with a different account, {$1900.00}. 

When I checked my account a few days into XXXX a new charge titled, balance adjustment was posted to my account on XX/XX/23, in the amount of {$1900.00}. Apple is stating this, Your dispute has been investigated. You contacted us on XX/XX/2023 regarding a payment to your Apple Card account. Goldman Sachs Bank USA has investigated your dispute and determined that no error occurred. Your payment of {$1900.00} was refunded to your bank account ending in XXXX as requested on XX/XX/2023.

You can view your payment history, monthly balance, minimum payment due, and payment due date in Wallet by tapping on your Apple Card or by accessing your most recent statement, however that is incorrect. 

Ive contacted so many different agents through chat because I never received a refund, should not have received a refund and I am unable to get this charge off my account. I finally spoke with one agent who stated I should send in proof of my bank statement that shows no refund was issued, and I did that on XX/XX/XXXX. When I submitted that I asked the agent how long does the investigation take, she stated 30 days. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and there hasnt been a removal of this inaccuracy. Im going to attach some statements made by apple representatives XX/XX/XXXX from a dispute agent about my submitted bank statement : At this moment it still says it's being reviewed. It doesn't give me any grave detail, but there should be more information within the next 24-48 hours. 

XX/XX/XXXX from an agent : Within 48 hours we should have an update. I am very sorry for this issue. We are working to fix it for you. 

XX/XX/XXXX from an agent : XXXX, I apologize for the hold. Thank you for your patience. This dispute is still been investigated. If any information needed we will reach out via email. 

XX/XX/XXXX chatted with a supervisor XXXX : Thank you for that information, I do see copies of your bank statement in your document library, however I do not see any notes regarding the statements being reviewed. I would be happy to escalate a complaint for you regarding this issue. I do apologize for all of the confusion and you having to call or chat in so often. I know that is frustrating. I would be frustrated as well. 

Thank you so much for your patience while I escalated that complaint. I have it submitted for you. I was very detailed as to what you submitted and have not heard anything back on. Please keep an eye on your email or for a phone call back from XXXX. Again I do apologize for all of this confusion. We will get this straightened out for you. Have a wonderful day. 

XX/XX/XXXX chatted with a supervisor XXXX : I submitted another dispute for you. I see that the previous dispute was closed. 

You can check again in 3 days. 

XX/XX/XXXX chatted with an agent XXXX : XXXX, after reviewing this issue, I do see they are currently working on this. You should expect communication from the team working on this issue. 

XX/XX/XXXX chatted with a supervisor who totally had no clue what I was referring to, as she kept mentioning old information and abruptly ended the chat after I told her I was filing a complaint with consumer finance and attaching chat documentation. Supervisor name, XXXX. 

Thank you for that information. I do apologize for the misinformation. After further of your account it looks as though the transaction in the amount of {$1900.00} was not transaction but a payment that was made on XX/XX/2023 was returned to you on XX/XX/2023. 

This is what she sends me after she supposedly reviewed the account. Old information. Nothing about my bank statements, noting about the complaint another agent filed for me- it was as if Apple isnt documenting properly or this agent was inadequate at her position. 

More chat from supervisor XXXX : Thank you for that information and I do understand your concerns. You can give us a call and we can assist you over the phone however the department for payments disputes you can not speak with directly. We can file a complaint for someone to reach out within 10 days after our review has been completed. Yes your bank statement are showing in the system that were submitted. 

Once she saw my bank statements had been submitted this is the response she gave, ONCE AGAIN Okay no problem, I have submitted a request to have it mailed out to you. In the meantime the email that was sent out concerning your dispute states as follows : Your dispute has been investigated. You contacted us on XX/XX/2023 regarding a payment to your Apple Card account. Goldman Sachs Bank USA has investigated your dispute and determined that no error occurred. Your payment of {$1900.00} was refunded to your bank account ending in XXXX as requested on XX/XX/2023.

The detailed and more thorough investigation by the Sherriffs major crimes, cyber-crimes, Attorney Generals Office, and Secret Service negate the intensity of your investigation. 
Knowing the lawful facts, we can not conclude Marcus conducted an adequate investigation. Unauthorized withdrawals were conducted by unauthorized users. Marcus did not attempt to limit the amount of the withdrawals. With each of these transactions exceeding the {$10000.00} daily aggregate amount, no Suspicious Activity Report was filed. No communication to this account holder was ever initiated. U.S. law enforcement provides banks with access to resources and tools that can be used to strengthen Bank Secrecy Act ( BSA ) /Anti-Money Laundering ( AML ) risk management programs. 
My funds were removed from Marcus without any recognition of the portent of these stolen funds. You are responsible for this loss. 
1. I would like to see documentation on the extent of the investigation on which you based your findings. It was your duty to offer to share the documents you relied on rather than just a transaction sheet. It is a violation to not produce these documents. Again, the attached investigation by government authorities validates that I did not authorize or conduct these transfers. 
2. Why doesnt every substantial withdrawal trigger a fraud concern?

3.

I need these funds released so that I can pay off my car. Each day that goes by with Marcus by GS holding my funds is another day interest is accruing. Does Marcus by GS intend to pay for the accrued interest due to the unjustified hold??

Never once was I told there would be a hold until I actually hit transfer and it was completed. Had I know it would be held I never wouldve transferred it to this shady company.

MARCUS BY GOLDMAN SACHS, an affiliate of GOLDMAN SACHS BANK has been in violation of the Acts, stated herein and has been regularly reporting negative activity without my consent, and has caused irreparable harm and injuries to me since about XXXX of the year XXXX in violation of the abovementioned Act and as stated in 15 U.S. Code 6801 - Protection of nonpublic personal information which states : ( a ) Privacy obligation policy - It is the policy of the Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers nonpublic personal information. 
( b ) Financial institutions safeguards - In furtherance of the policy in subsection ( a ), each agency or authority described in section 6805 ( a ) of this title, other than the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, shall establish appropriate standards for the financial institutions subject to their jurisdiction relating to administrative, technical, and physical safeguards ( 1 ) to insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information ; ( 2 ) to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records ; and ( 3 ) to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. 

In addition to 15 U.S. Code See Also 6805 Enforcement ( a ) WHICH STATES THAT : Subject to subtitle B of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 [ 12 U.S.C. 5511 et seq. ], this subchapter and the regulations prescribed thereunder shall be enforced by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, the Federal functional regulators, the State insurance authorities, and the Federal Trade Commission with respect to financial institutions and other persons subject to their jurisdiction under applicable law, and ( b ) ENFORCEMENT OF SECTION 6801 ( 1 ) Except as provided in paragraph ( 2 ), the agencies and authorities described in subsection ( a ), other than the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, shall implement the standards prescribed under section 6801 ( b ) of this title in the same manner, to the extent practicable, as standards prescribed pursuant to section 1831p1 ( a ) of title 12 are implemented pursuant to such section. Therefore, it is within the jurisdiction of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to enforce this/these Act ( s ) to ensure the protections of all consumers.

SEE ALSO 15 U.S. Code 6802 - Obligations with respect to disclosures of personal information under : ( a ) Notice requirements which states : Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, a financial institution may not, directly or through any affiliate, disclose to a nonaffiliated third party any nonpublic personal information, unless such financial institution provides or has provided to the consumer a notice that complies with section 6803 of this title.

According to 16 CFR 313.7 - Form of opt out notice to consumers ; opt out methods. ( e ) Time to comply with opt out. Which states that : You must comply with a consumer 's opt out direction as soon as reasonably practicable after you receive it., and 16 CFR 313.7 ( f ) Continuing right to opt out, which also states that A consumer may exercise the right to opt out at any time, and 16 CFR 313.7 ( g ) Duration of consumer 's opt out direction.

( 1 ) A consumer 's direction to opt out under this section is effective until the consumer revokes it in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically. 
( XXXX ) When a customer relationship terminates, the customer 's opt out direction continues to apply to the nonpublic personal information that you collected during or related to that relationship. If the individual subsequently establishes a new customer relationship with you, the opt out direction that applied to the former relationship does not apply to the new relationship.

15 U.S. Code 1681b - Permissible purposes of consumer reports ( a ) Subject to subsection ( c ), any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other : ( 2 ) In accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates.

As stated herein, as well as the enclosed letter which clearly signifies my right to opt out as stated in 6802 ( b ) : Opt out ( 1 ) In general A financial institution may not disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party unless ( A ) such financial institution clearly and conspicuously discloses to the consumer, in writing or in electronic form or other form permitted by the regulations prescribed under section XXXX of this title, that such information XXXX be disclosed to such third party ; ( B ) the consumer is given the opportunity, before the time that such information is initially disclosed, to direct that such information not be disclosed to such third party ; and ( C ) the consumer is given an explanation of how the consumer can exercise that nondisclosure option. MARCUS BY GOLDMAN SACHS, an affiliate of GOLDMAN SACHS BANK has never disclosed this information to enable me as the consumer the opportunity to exercise the abovementioned Opt out rights afforded to me.

MARCUS BY GOLDMAN SACHS, an affiliate of GOLDMAN SACHS BANK ultimately sold/referred the debt to RADIUS GLOBAL SOLUTIONS LLC ( see enclosed exhibit LB5 ) but still continued/continues to report the above-mentioned account as CHARGED OFF to all of the major credit reporting agencies, despite the fact the account has been paid in full. ( See Exhibits XXXX & XXXX ). This ongoing negative reporting is causing irreparable injury, embarrassment, emotional damage, stress and humiliation to me and my family by being denied of loans, lines of credit and my ability to prosperously move forward financially in life by their violations of the laws stated herein. It has also come to my awareness that a CHARGE OFF is also considered as Certificate of Indebtedness ( COI ) which means that it considered as Income and must be removed from all credit reports. It is also illegal to report any negative transaction history to the major credit reporting agencies which MARCUS BY GOLDMAN SACHS, an affiliate of GOLDMAN SACHS BANK has in the past and continues to illegally report to this day.

17 CFR 248.7 - Form of opt out notice to consumers ; opt out methods ( a ) ( 1 ) Form of opt out notice. If you are required to provide an opt out notice under 248.10 ( a ), you must provide a clear and conspicuous notice to each of your consumers that accurately explains the right to opt out under that section. The notice must state : ( i ) That you disclose or reserve the right to disclose nonpublic personal information about your consumer to a nonaffiliated third party ; ( ii ) That the consumer has the right to opt out of that disclosure; and ( iii ) A reasonable means by which the consumer may exercise the opt out right.

16 CFR 313.7 - Form of opt out notice to consumers ; opt out methods.

( a ) ( 1 ) Form of opt out notice. If you are required to provide an opt out notice under 313.10 ( a ), you must provide a clear and conspicuous notice to each of your consumers that accurately explains the right to opt out under that section. The notice must state : ( i ) That you disclose or reserve the right to disclose non-public personal information about your consumer to a nonaffiliated third party ; ( ii ) That the consumer has the right to opt out of that disclosure; and ( iii ) A reasonable means by which the consumer may exercise the opt out right.

It is for the reasons stated herein and the protection of my rights as a consumer is why I am entitled to the remedy and relief sought in the form of MARCUS BY GOLDMAN SACHS, an affiliate of GOLDMAN SACHS BANK correcting the record by removing all negative reporting, and negative credit history from any and all credit reporting agencies records, including but not limited to XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and financial compensation for the violations committed which has caused irreparable harm, embarrassment, humiliation, mental anguish and undue financial hardships committed against me for which compensation in the amount of {$50000.00} ( XXXX XXXX USD ) should be granted in my favor.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NJ","07202","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-16,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8013323,2023

I called again to inquire about my reversal of the finance charge but they stated that they only had a technical complaint about the XXXX  app but not a dispute of the finance charges. I immediately logged a dispute but it was denied about a week later stating that no error had been made on their part and that the finance charge would stay. 

I have included a screen shot of the XXXX  app as it was showing a due date of XX/XX/XXXX the same day I called them which was on XX/XX/XXXX.

Promising someone in fraud will contact me directly about the case if there's any further issues. XX/XX/XXXX Goldman Sachs once again reopened the dispute. XX/XX/XXXX they rejected it claiming no evidence was supplied. Despite the fact I had already on previous occasions confirmed evidence was received on their end Illustrating the damaged items as received and the proof I contacted the merchant to resolve it already.

No one from Goldman Sachs called me or reached out to me after that. XX/XX/XXXX Goldman Sachs responded to my CFPB saying they've closed the case stating I do not have proof I returned the items. As I've already mentioned to them both verbally with a XXXX ( on the phone ), through text as part of my fraud claim with them, as well as in my CFPB complaint, I reached out to the merchant to make them aware I received damaged items. XXXX XXXX ( the merchants ) website they must be contacted through a submission form on their website to initiate a return. I supplied evidence that I've submitted this form/ reached out to the seller to Goldman Sachs XXXX XXXX did not respond back to my contact to initiate a return or address the issue whatsoever. Hence the whole reason I filed the claim through Goldman Sachs in the first place. Going by Goldman Sachs response to the first CFPB complaint they're clearly not reading any of the provided files, evidence, documentation nor the complaint itself as they are not addressing the issue whatsoever. Goldman Sachs then responded on XX/XX/XXXX that I had no reason to contact the merchant because the merchants XXXX policy states that returns can be directly returned to them without contact. However I made the order in XXXX when the return policy by XXXX specified they must be contacted first before a return is made. Goldman Sachs is fully aware of this but clearly doesn't want to admit how terribly they've handled this claim and are grasping at straws.

In XX/XX/2017, the XXXX data breach exposed my personal information, including but not limited to my name, Social Security number, address, and other sensitive details. Since then, I have been grappling with the distressing consequences of identity theft. Unidentified individuals maliciously misused my stolen information to open an APPLE CARD/GS BANK account without my consent or knowledge.Upon discovering this unauthorized APPLE CARD/GS BANK account on my credit report, resolving the issue proved to be an arduous and time-consuming process. I had to spend a considerable amount of time navigating the complexities of reporting the identity theft financial institutions, and credit bureaus, furthermore in my pursuit to remove the fraudulent account from my credit report, I incurred substantial financial expenses during this dispute process.Throughout this challenging ordeal, I have maintained records of all communications, expenses, and actions taken to rectify the identity theft and remove the fraudulent account from my credit report. Being a victim of identity theft has had a profound impact on my personal and financial well-being. The unauthorized account has caused undue stress, affected my creditworthiness, and disrupted my financial stability. 
I hope the necessary steps are taken to correct the inaccuracies in my credit report resulting from the fraudulent activity.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","IL","60608","","Consent provided","Web",2023-07-29,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7323756,2023

2023-03-02,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem when making payments","Problem during payment process","Apple has recently started holding my payments for an unreasonable amount of time after they have been debited from my bank before crediting my account. For example, between yesterday and today I made two payments, one on XXXX {$4900.00} and one on XXXX for {$4800.00}. I was informed in a chat today with Apple Card customer service that it will take 11 days before these payments post and add available credit to my account. 
This is an unreasonable amount of time for Apple to hold my funds and not credit my account and is problematic for the following reasons. 
1. ) I feel Apple is doing this in order to limit the amount I can use my card and receive cash back 2. ) Apple has been given no reason to delay credit of my payments. I have been a excellent client and made all payments on time and therefore interest free.

3. ) By refusing to credit my account in a timely manner they tie up both my funds and my ability to use the card. Therefore the funds are either tied up on a credit card that has no ability to earn me any rewards or cash back or if I pay the full amount and to have free use of my funds I am forced to pay the interest rate on their card.

4. ) This behavior by Apple might be understandable if I was not an excellent client with an excellent record of payment. In XXXX alone, I used the Apple Card to make over {$390000.00} in purchases. I have a XXXX credit limit, so on the average I not only paid my entire XXXX Apple Card balance each month, but I also paid an additional XXXX over the XXXX balance. Dates and information leading up to these issues. 
Historically, I have had no issue with Apple or with receiving immediate credit to my account after making a payment. 
However, on XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment for {$10000.00} at XXXX from XXXXXXXX XXXX to the Apple Card that was declined because of a issue with my account on Landmark Banks end. Upon seeing that the payment was rejected at I immediately on the same day ( XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ) made another payment for {$4900.00} from my XXXX XXXX account. This payment was accepted. 
This payment was not late by any means. 
Not only had I been on time, I made the following multiple accepted payments to my Apple Card in XXXX XX/XX/XXXX for {$2900.00}, XX/XX/XXXX for {$990.00}, and XX/XX/XXXX for {$990.00}. 
Since this happened I have had to wait an unreasonable amount of time for my account to be credited after making my payment. When asked the explanation I received on XXXX for a payment made on XX/XX/XXXX and shown to be debited from my account on XX/XX/XXXX was the following response. 
From Apple : It looks like we have received a reversal on a payment you've made in the past. Due to this it may take longer for payments to reflect in your available credit. The payment of {$4900.00} will release on XX/XX/XXXX and the payments of {$2400.00} and {$15000.00} will release on XXXX hold is on our end not the banks end. Anytime there is a canceled, rejected or reversed payment, it can place a hold on the next payments made in sequence to that one. 
I was hopeful when I made the payments today that the hold would be released, however that was not the case and today when I made an inquiry this is the message I received. 
From Apple This payment has been applied to your account but is currently on hold. Your available credit for the payment in the amount of {$4800.00} made on XXXX will reflect on XXXX. In the meantime, you can review your account balance and make additional payments by tapping the link below. XXXX Im obviously going to stop using my Apple Card and thankfully have the means to pivot my expenses to other cards, but Apple Card should not be able target their customers who dont allow Apple to make money because they utilize their Apple card, pay it off and have a great payment history.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","TN","37215","","Consent provided","Web",2023-03-02,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6638134,2023

Goldman Sachs has been withholding my funds, which are held in a savings account. My name is XXXX XXXX, and for the past 24 days, starting on XX/XX/, I have been diligently attempting to address this matter through numerous phone calls and the submission of documentation to Goldman Sachs. Unfortunately, my funds have remained frozen and inaccessible during this time and this has caused much undue stress as a single mother, small business owner who makes a living based on commission, and as a full-time XXXX XXXX 
To provide further context, I am unable to access my Marcus Goldman Savings Account. Not only can I not transfer or obtain my own funds, but I can not check my account number, balance, transaction history, or anything related to it. When I attempt to log in, I am met with a notification indicating that my account has been locked and that I should contact the institution for resolution. 
Upon contacting Marcus Goldman, I was informed that their verification process necessitates an outbound call to the transferring bank and in this case its XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, where I had requested my funds to be transferred. However, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, like many other financial institutions, has a policy against disclosing confidential information during inbound calls. 
It's worth noting that Marcus Goldman 's policies regarding their verification process is the same as XXXX, where they do not allow inbound calls and will not provide confidential information to another external banking institution by phone. Although, this is part of their current standard practices. 
Since XX/XX/XXXX, and after the representative breached their confidentiality agreement and provided me with my secret password- I have repeatedly requested that Marcus Goldman promptly close my account, but they have failed to do so. During one phone call with a Goldman representative, I was informed that Marcus Goldman would close my account due to alleged fraudulent activity, with my funds returning to the original account. However, another call contradicted this statement, with Marcus Goldman explaining that they were not closing my account. 
Subsequently, I was advised to send my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account statements to Marcus Goldman by mail as part of the verification process. The representative explained the verification process would take at least 10 days and if this was an accurate statement Goldman Sachs should have released my funds by XX/XX/. A representative did confirm receipt of both my final notice and account statements, and she explained they were received on XX/XX/. After receipt of the final notice and account statement Marcus failed to call me to resolve the issue until I called them on XX/XX/, where she explained they did in fact receive the documents. 
In my efforts to resolve this issue, I have contacted Goldman Sachs customer service on numerous occasions, providing detailed records of each call : - XX/XX/XXXX  at XXXX XXXX  ( Duration : 14 minutes ) - XX/XX/XXXX  at XXXX XXXX  ( Duration : 29 minutes ) - XX/XX/ at XXXX XXXX  ( Duration : 24 minutes ) - XX/XX/XXXX  at XXXX XXXX  ( Duration : 18 minutes ) - XX/XX/XXXX  at XXXX XXXX  ( Duration : 23 minutes ) - XX/XX/XXXX  at XXXX XXXX  ( Duration : 39 minutes ) - XX/XX/XXXX  at XXXX XXXX  ( Duration : 14 minutes ) - XX/XX/XXXX  at XXXX XXXX  ( Duration : 15 minutes ) - XX/XX/XXXX  at XXXX XXXX  ( Duration : 12 minutes ) - XX/XX/XXXX  at XXXX XXXX  ( Duration : 13 minutes ) - XX/XX/XXXX  at XXXX XXXX  ( Duration : 11 minutes ) - XX/XX/ at XXXX XXXX  ( Duration : 26 minutes ) - XX/XX/XXXX  at XXXX XXXX  ( Duration : 2 minutes ) - XX/XX/XXXX  at XXXX XXXX  ( Duration : 14 minutes ) - XX/XX/XXXX  at XXXX XXXX  ( Duration : 43 minutes ) Despite my persistent efforts to resolve this issue, my funds remain unreleased for 24 days since my initial request on XX/XX/. 
On XX/XX/, I visited the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in person as Marcus Goldman explained they needed to speak with my banking institution to transfer the funds. I called Marcus Goldman, placed the call on speaker phone as I sat with XXXX XXXX, the Vice President of XXXX XXXX, at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, while speaking with Goldman Sachs. During this call, both XXXX and I were surprised by the comments made by the Goldman Sachs representative and the uncertainty regarding the release of my funds, as there was no apparent reason for their continued withholding. Additionally, Marcus Goldman made statements around their contradictory verification process, and policies during this time. While on the phone, I also explained that the first time I spoke with a representative they had breached their confidentiality agreement by disclosing my secret password over the phone after I had provided an incorrect one. 
In response to this ongoing situation and the resultant overdraft fee I incurred at my personal bank due to Goldman declining the transfer of my funds, I sent a formal notice to Goldman Sachs on XX/XX/, urgently requesting the release of my funds. Alongside this notice, I included bank account statements from my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account, which unequivocally confirm my ownership of the account and its non-business nature. Regrettably, my funds have yet to be released. XXXX at XXXX did say that we could discuss the overdraft fees once the issue relating to Goldman Sachs was resolved as she quickly understood that it was no fault of my own. 
During a recorded conversation with a Goldman Sachs representative, I was informed that it would take approximately 10 business days to address and rectify these concerns for the release of funds. In accordance with this information, I allowed a total of 14 business days from the date of that letter for the initiation of the transfer, which equates to XX/XX/. 
However, as of the date of this letter, my funds remain unreleased, causing not only financial hardship but also significant stress and inconvenience. This situation has placed an undue burden on me and my children, as I am a full-time mother, business owner, and XXXX. 
In one of the many phone calls to Marcus Goldman I did request transcripts of each phone call and they have failed to provide these as of XX/XX/. I am currently and actively trying to seek legal counsel on this matter, and I am writing to you urgently asking if you can help in anyway? My house payment is due on XX/XX/, and the unavailability of my funds in my Marcus Goldman account will undoubtedly lead to further stress in the near future. Any assistance or guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

My external account was already linked and verified to Marcus, and I have completed other transfers to this account from Marcus in the past. I called Marcus around XXXX ( XXXX ) on Friday, XX/XX/23. The representative took my instructions over the phone and submitted the request. Later that afternoon, the money had not arrived, so I called again just before XXXX ( XXXX ). The representative saw the request, but told me it was under review. She would not provide any additional information or identify any particular point of concern. 

From Marcuss customer FAQs posted on the website : Your money should arrive the same business day if the transaction is requested before XXXX XXXX XXXX. If there's an issue verifying an account or with a PIN verification, it could take between 1 and 3 business days for your funds to arrive in the external account. 

On Monday morning, XX/XX/23, the funds had still not arrived. I called Marcus again around XXXX ( XXXX ). I spoke to the representative, and she transferred me to her supervisor. Then the supervisor sent me to the Fraud Department. I learned there were two stages of reviews, and the first round was completed on Monday with no issues identified. And the second review was being expedited ( to be completed within 3 hours ). But there was still no information on why the first review was not completed on the same day that I submitted the instructions ( Friday ). As best I can tell, I submitted my wire instructions well in advance of the
same-day cutoff, and Marcus took no further action that day. Is the review team not equipped to handle the volume of daily requests? Or did Marcus decide to intentionally sit on the request to avoid having to disburse the funds ( and continue to receive a few days interest on the funds I needed access to )? 

This whole experience has been incredibly disappointing. I was unable to pick up the car I was scheduled to purchase. Why is Marcus making it so difficult to access my own funds??","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","TX","787XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-01-23,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6476421,2023

The response to my complaint was the VERY FIRST time ( despite XXXX calls ) that I was able to find out why Goldman Sachs XXXX a balance on my account. I was told twice between XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX that the account had a XXXX balance and was closed. Subsequently their response explained that they took it upon themselves to issue me a credit ( that I did not ask for, they re-opened this dispute on their own ). Due to the fact that I had been given so many different answers, I attempted to speak to a supervisor to get this cleared up and pay the balance if in fact I owed it. Even their response to you was full of inaccurate dates and given the multiple different answers I got from them I was very hesitant to take anything on face value. While attempting to settle this matter, Goldman Sachs hit my credit report for a 30 day late on an account that I closed in XX/XX/XXXX. I finally got to an advocate and he said he would work to remove it from my credit report. I did not create the balance and no explanation for it was given to me until after they reported it late. I called to follow up multiple times between XXXX and now and I was told they would not do anything on the account until the credit process was complete. I called again today and apparently someone called me on XX/XX/XXXX and I did not answer. That was the last attempt they made to contact me aside from debt collection and they knew nothing. I was told this morning that they will not change the reporting and now it is showing 60 days late. My credit report has dropped XXXX points due to their error on my account and lack of communication ( until I filed with you ) as to why there was a balance after being told it was a XXXX balance. I would like Goldman Sachs to actually pull the recorded calls. I have contacted an attorney but would prefer to resolve this matter with XXXX  if possible. Whenever I call, no one has any idea as to what is going on and my advocate ( XXXX ) who promised he would stick with me until resolution has disappeared. 

Original complaint filed XX/XX/XXXX, their response to this is how I found out why there was a balance on my account. No one at XXXX could tell me prior to this : In XX/XX/XXXX I had disputed a charge for a rental house on my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I had spoke to multiple reps while the situation was happening and followed their guidance. The rental agency was threatening to call the police so I had to release the dispute then refile after we had checked out per the advice of XXXX. The dispute was ultimately ruled in favor of the XXXX house ( property management ) even though I sent photos of someone else 's dirty clothes, rats, broken A/C and broken elevator etc. At that time, I made the decision that I no longer wanted to do business with XXXX and paid the account balance IN FULL and closed the account. This past XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I got a letter in the mail from XXXX stating that they decided on multiple disputes incorrectly and would be re-opening them to adjust the rulings. I DID NOT initiate this contact, they did. I called into XXXX and the rep I talked to had no idea about the letter or knowledge of the fact that they as a company were reevaluating closed disputes. My account remains closed. Fast forward a few months and I get a letter that states they did not rule in my favor ( again ). I do not care, I didn't ask for any action to be taken. They initiated. Now, I am getting bills every month ( even though my account shows as closed on my credit and when I try to contact them ( see screen shot ). I have spent hours on the phone with them and no one seems to be able to assist. I get a different answer from everyone I speak with.

These charges appeared to come from XXXX as they were accompanied by XXXX characters. 

Apple then credited the fraudulent charges ( as they should have ) and started and investigation. 

Then for some reason, they credited the amounts again, which resulted in a credit balance of - {$2500.00} which was the result of the second crediting less the amount that I actually owed them of {$310.00}. 

I sent them a letter dared XX/XX/XXXX ( copy attached - Applecard.pdf ) explaining that they had made a mistake. I never received a reply. I attached a marked up pdf of my XXXX statement ( also being forwarded to you - XXXX ) which outlined the problem. 

In the last week, I received a series of emails informing me that the dispute had been settled and they were adding the charges to my account as they had been already credited. 

This should have resulted in a total amount owed of the {$310.00} BUT after paying that amount I find that they are still charging me {$1000.00}. 

I called them yesterday and was unable to either resolve the problem or even get them to investigate. I sent them another letter this morning and I am also forwarding that letter to you ( XXXX ). 

It seems illogical to me that they would take off the fraudulent charges TWICE and then replace them and it would result in a total of charges that I did not charge to this card. 

Please help. I do not wish to pay over {$1000.00} that I have not incurred. Thank you!","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","PA","15206","Older American","Consent provided","Web",2023-09-28,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7436062,2023

I didn't have much at the time since I didn't have any of the evidence they had supporting keeping the charge, only the email I sent following up the delivery of the printer that I originally ordered. 

By XX/XX/XXXX I received the Outcome of the investigation, without them providing any evidence, indicating that the charge remained because I failed to provide any evidence against the charge.

Findings after reviewing evidence. 
1. Goldman Sach failed to realize that the evidence that was provided by the merchant was for the purchase of 2 pieces of clothing when I send them information that my order was for a printer.

2. Goldman Sach failed to realize that the documents provided had 2 different IP addresses referenced for the purchased transaction origin. 
3. Goldman Sach failed to realize that the provided tracking number by the merchant was a false number that does not exist in USPS. 

Attachments included : 1. Evidence that the merchant provided to Goldman Sach. This evidence was provided to me after the second time of reopening the dispute.

2. Documented report showing my points 1 and 2 from the findings.

For a period of eight years prior to this transition, I was a responsible and compliant account holder with XXXX XXXX. However, during the course of the transition to Goldman Sachs, which lasted approximately 3-4 months, I encountered significant and unexpected difficulties. 

Access to XXXX XXXXXXXX Account : Throughout the transition period, I was unable to access my XXXX XXXXXXXX account. This prevented me from viewing my balance, paying my bills, or managing any other account-related matters. 

Failure to Receive New Card : Despite diligent communication with Goldman Sachs ' customer support, I did not receive my new card. The support staff repeatedly assured me that the card was on its way, only to later discover that it had been sent to an outdated address. 

Delays in Addressing the Issue : The eventual realization of the mistake by Goldman Sachs led to further delays. The process of receiving my new card and accessing the newly switched Marcus account was fraught with unnecessary challenges. 

Credit Report Impact : During this period, I received a credit report indicating serious delinquency on this credit card account. This was alarming, given my otherwise perfect payment record on this and all other credit cards under my name. Though I promptly paid the outstanding {$30.00} balance upon finally gaining access to my account, the delinquency had already been recorded on my report. 

Impact on Mortgage Application : This erroneous delinquency has had a direct and adverse impact on my attempt to purchase a house, as it reflects unfairly on my creditworthiness. 

Unsuccessful Attempts at Resolution : Despite my best efforts to reach out to the concerned parties and seek resolution, I have been met with resistance and inaction. 

In light of the foregoing, I respectfully request your intervention and assistance in resolving this matter. I believe that the facts clearly demonstrate that I am a responsible consumer who pays debts in a timely manner, and that this incident is an aberration resulting from circumstances beyond my control. 

Your prompt attention to this matter will not only correct an injustice but also facilitate my ongoing efforts to purchase a home. Please find enclosed relevant documents supporting my case. 

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

I was able to quickly call in and confirm the transfer and my account was unlocked. However, my co-tennant was not able to unlock her account after many attempts. She has even mailed in a notarized """" affidavit of identity '' ( AOI ) as per request of the bank fraud department on XX/XX/XXXX. But 18 days later, they still show no receipt of the AOI. 

Currently, the principal balance in the joint account is {$250000.00}, plus interest paid. I have had no access to these funds for over 30 days. 

I asked the bank to return the funds in the joint account to the FUNDING account ( s ) until the account lock issue has been resolved, but they responded that this was not an option for """" fraud '' reasons. This seems ridiculous because the funds are being returned to the funding account, whose provenence is known. The customer service team refused to escalate the issue beyond a first level manager to resolve this problem. They also refuse to accept electronic or photo versions of the notarized AOI to expedite the account verification process. 

There seems to be a business process issue in the way the Fraud department at Marcus by Goldman Sachs manages custody of funds received. Their account verification process relies only on delivered mail and they refuse to acknowlege that this is unreliable or that their mail processing team could have made a mistake. Additionally, the customer service team refuses to allow me to speak directly to the account verification team by phone. 

I can not believe that it is legal for them to freeze my deposits under a pretense of fraud for an indefinite period of time.

Despite storing a down payment on a home for several months earning their acclaimed high interest rates, when it came time to purchase a home they took 2 business days of persistent phone calls to ultimately reject the wire transfer without a reason citing policy of """" case by case '' as justification. 

Money that was deposited to the bank, money that was marked available for several months, was inaccessible at a critical time of need. The phone operators were unable to help because the structure of the company prohibited them from understanding the rejection, prohibited them from contacting the right person, and ultimately made each person who I can talk to repeat the same line of being unable to help get the money I left with the bank.

I am submitting this complaint because I started a dispute with my Apple credit card by Goldman Sachs for a {$4000.00} payment made to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX a contracting company XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX that did not provide the service agreed upon or completed any job as described. The dispute was reverse despite having submitted evidence that supports my claim. I helped my brother and partner, XXXX XXXX, with his home improvement renovations at his rental property by submitting a {$4000.00} payment to a XXXX using my Apple credit card, but XXXX XXXX was victim of fraud. 
I provided expert testimony, the contract, inspection report, and an inspection letter giving a direct comparison to the sales contract, it explains in detail line-by-line what the merchant did not finish or complete correctly, emails, lawsuit, counterclaim, third-party complaint, police report, litigation files explaining all the violations and the fraudulent service to the courts, pictures, and a XXXX XXXX link showing video recordings XXXX a background that XXXX XXXX got from public sources right after he found out everything after the facts, it shows that XXXX XXXX the contractor has a long history of criminal record for fencing and stealing, and any other documentation supporting. 
Regarding the merchants response, I can say that the cancellation and refund policy was not disclosed at the time of sale. Not knowing any better my brother entered a contract that did not comply with New Jersey Home Improvement contract regulations NJAC13:45A-16. The merchant falsely proclaimed a breach of contract and tried to induce XXXX XXXX to remove the disputes. Otherwise stated in the supposed breach of contract he would put a lien on the property which did not happen since work was not completed or performed. The merchant keeps insisting my brother breached the contract when the detailed description of events document in the litigation document sent by my brothers attorney explained XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX failed to properly complete the home improvements pursuant to industry standards ; failed to provide services as required by the contract ; made false representations to my brother ; and violated the Consumer Fraud Act and Home Improvement Act as more fully detailed in the document. Merchant estates my brother received the expected goods/services or encountered. As shown in the inspection report and as stated in the inspector letter drafted by a licensed home inspector, he did not receive such goods/services. As a result, he requested full reimbursement of the amount paid. As stated by my brothers attorney, """" By engaging in the above conduct, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX unconscionable commercial practice of deception, fraud, and falsity or misrepresentation in connection with the sale of the service and goods in that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX made misrepresentations of the facts, concealed facts, suppressed facts, and excluded facts to effectuate the sale of the service and goods to my brother. '' In the emails you can see that as soon as my brother questioned the merchant about the progress of the work ( email response sent XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and advised the merchant that he would not have to pay him in full when the work was not yet completed ( email response sent on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), the merchant realized that the scam was over. The merchant tried to have my brother into a mutual release and settlement agreement and wanted my brother to pay him an additional {$8500.00} under the guise that he would forgive a remaining balance of {$22000.00} ( email sent from merchant on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ). Here is when my brother was convinced, he was the victim of fraud. My brother, not knowing any better, believed he owed him money but when he visited the property on XX/XX/XXXX, and confirmed the merchant did not have anything completed and did damages. He immediately took all steps necessary to mitigate his damages and report his unlawful activity to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Consumer Affairs which I am also attaching to the email showing he is not licensed. XXXX, the contractor, is well aware that the home improvements were not fully completed. Despite this, he demanded payment from my brother and as my brothers attorney mentioned, Said demands are in violation. My brother have already contacted XXXX XXXX Co regarding this matter, but he is not reimbursing any funds, you can see this in the email, the evidence was sent to XXXX and is going to be included in this complaint, the reimbursement is a fair and reasonable course of action in this situation. You can also read the tenant 's letters ; they are witnesses to what occurred. Once my brother refuted the merchant about not paying him more money when he demanded the merchant himself stated he did not wish to work with him anymore ( email response sent on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and that he would move forward with what he needed to do for the situation. Merchant mentioned that """" a breach entitles him to the full contract amount. '' when no job was completed. The merchant failed to provide the service when he left the job unfinished and unsafe. He did not know how to orchestrate the job. He proclaimed maliciously to having completed the job. The merchant contacted my brother by email on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and he responded on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, requesting him to resolve the claim and asking for reimbursement. My brother also solicited specific information regarding what was purchased, and copies of all documentation about these transactions including invoices and the warranties. My brother officially terminated him from the job and let him know about the damage he caused and that he left the work project incomplete. The merchant responded dishonestly by attaching a breach of contract that he drafted himself and falsely claiming he was going to put a lien on the property and suggesting my brother to release the disputes otherwise he will have to assume the consequences. My brother did not receive any credit slip or chargeback approval letter from the merchant to prove they agree he is due credit for this {$4000.00} charge. Documentation that supports my position has already been submitted to the email address XXXX Please, note that Apple Credit Card was utilized as part of a more significant payment made to XXXX XXXX XXXX My brother paid the total cost upfront as per the balance of the contract. The job the merchant started is not finished, and he did not provide the service they agreed upon in the contract. XXXX did nothing correctly at my XXXX house and didn't repair things. 

I am going to include XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  dispute results in which the provisional credit issued to the account is now permanent. Apple credit card should have the provisional credit permanent according to consumer protection they offer and in this case for uncompleted job and poor workmanship. 

Please, know that on or about XX/XX/XXXX, the state of New jersey revoked the license for XXXX XXXX co which it can be seen at my brother 's attorney filing document submitted to the NJ  court. Referred page 11 and EXHIBIT """" J '' I would appreciate it if Apple Credit Card by Goldman Sachs could expedite a permanent adjustment process. Please keep me updated on the progress.

I participated in their promotion, which required depositing {$10000.00} to receive an extra {$100.00}, in XXXX of this year. Despite meeting all the necessary conditions, I have not received the bonus. 

Here is a timeline of the events and interactions I have had with Marcus Goldman : In XXXX, I deposited {$10000.00} into my account to fulfill the promotion requirements and become eligible for the bonus. 

The bonus appeared on my account initially but stopped showing up in XXXX. 
Concerned about the missing bonus, I called Marcus Goldman 's customer service and I was informed that there was a technical error but assured that I was still eligible for the bonus. I was told that the bonus would be credited to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, as the bonus did not appear on my account, I contacted customer service again. I was instructed to maintain the account balance until XX/XX/XXXX. 

Following their instructions, I kept the balance in my account and called customer service once more. On this occasion, I was assured that I had met all the conditions and the bonus would be credited within 1-3 business days. Additionally, I was informed that I was free to move the balance in my account. 

Based on the information provided, I removed the {$10000.00} from my account on XX/XX/XXXX, expecting the bonus to be credited soon. 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I engaged in a chat conversation with a Marcus Goldman agent who was not only rude but also claimed that my account was not eligible for the bonus because there was no balance. This contradicts the information previously given to me and is extremely frustrating. 

Throughout this process, I have been constantly fed inaccurate information and denied the promised bonus, despite fulfilling all the requirements. This situation has caused me significant inconvenience and has damaged my trust in Marcus Goldman.

I kindly request your intervention in this matter. I believe that Marcus Goldman should honor their promotional offer and credit my account with the {$100.00} bonus as originally promised.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NJ","073XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-05-14,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",6974594,2023

The item was purchased on Apple online and pick up in the store ( XXXX XXXX Apple store ). As soon as I saw the notification, I reached out to the Goldman Sachs Apple support team. I told them it was an unauthorized charge. The charge was disputed and I had all my card numbers replaced. Few days later, the transaction still went through and someone picked up the item in the store by using my ID. My dispute got rebilled several times till now. Got a report from Goldman Sachs showing details that I made the purchase and picked up. Seems like the thief has all my personal information including my name, address, phone number, card number, and even my XXXX address. However, I was never there when the item was picked up. I do not own the item, and I do not know who has it. The person used guest checkout when making the purchase. The support team from Goldman Sachs refused to do further investigation. 

( XX/XX/2023 ) I made complaints on XXXX  and CFPB. I also went to my local authority to file a report. However, officer there said that I needed an affidavit letter from Goldman Sachs stating that this transaction was a fraud. I reached out to GS support and asked about the affidavit letter but the person said she couldn't help me with that. I didn't know who to reach out. I held on the report and waited to see if XXXX  or CFPB would push them to do more investigation. But no. 

( XX/XX/2023 ) One of the GS support team manager reached out to me earlier today said that he saw the complaint on XXXX  and told me that there's nothing else they can do unless I provide additional evidence or I can just file a report to my local authority. He couldn't even tell me what kind of additional evidence I can provide. I told him that I want to file a police report and the police officer so that they can know what actually happened that day in the store. The police officer told me that I need an affidavit letter from GS stating that this transaction was a fraud, so that they can start with the investigation. But the GS manager refused to provide the letter. 

I don't understand the logic here. GS wants me to file a police report and provide additional evidence, but they refuse to let the progress start. I even filled out FTC Identity Theft Affidavit report. I now have all the documents ready for filing the report, except for that affidavit letter.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NY","11354","","Consent provided","Web",2023-07-06,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7213246,2023

I submitted applications to extend credit on 13 plus occasions and was denied. As you may be aware, an adverse action against a consumer is against Federal law. Pursuant to 15 USC 1691 ( a ) ( 3 ), I have been violated. I have the right to credit under the Truth In Lending Act, 15 USC 1602 ( f ). I understand what a credit card is and that I used my credit card to credit this transaction, pursuant to 15 USC 1602 ( l ). Furthermore, you proclaiming an adverse action against me is an unauthorized use of my credit card from which, I received no benefit, pursuant to 15 USC 1602 ( p ). 
As seen in the Notice section at the bottom of the adverse action letters Ive received from Goldman Sachs Bank, it states that the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants because the applicants has in good faith exercised ANY right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. Furthermore Goldman Sachs Bank released nonpublic personal information to the consumer reporting agencies, which ultimately violated my rights to privacy pursuant 15 USC 1681 section 604A.

This is the last attempt to give Goldman Sachs Bank an opportunity to cure and rectify this situation. My intent of this letter is to benefit from a fair and honorable transaction, through a right granted to me according to law. You have 7 calendar days from the receipt of this letter to reverse your illegal adverse action against me and approve the extension of credit as well as compensate me for the damages this has caused over the last couple of years. If you do not, you will be held civilly liable in accordance with 15 USC 1691e ( a ) and ( b ) for violating the law and an invoice for damages shall follow.

There was no problem opening the Savings Account online, and no problem having cashback deposited from my XXXX Credit Card directly into the Savings Account. 

However, now that I'm trying to withdraw money from the Savings Account ( from accumulated cashback from my Apple Credit Card ) to my personal checking, XXXX now tells me ( on XX/XX/2023 ) that I have to """" verify '' the checking account I'm trying to withdraw funds into. XXXX opened a text chat window ( on my XXXX ). After texting with customer service, the XXXX told me that I have to call ( can not text/chat ), and have to do so between XXXX XXXX Monday to Friday. ( It was Saturday afternoon when I was trying to take care of this. ) Honestly, this feels like a huge bait-and-switch. XXXX pushed this XXXX Account very heavily through my XXXX ( before sign-up ), and I don't remember needing any information other than my SSN to sign up ( in addition to my name, address, etc. which I already have on file with XXXX and which I believe was entered automatically ). It seems very shady : ( a ) to not actually have a full/working account upon sign-up, ( b ) to hide this fact until XXXX XXXX ( in my case, weeks later ) when the customer attempts a first withdrawal, and ( c ) to then give the run around ( chat, then told to phone but only during certain weekday business hours -- whereas """" opening '' an account seems to be available XXXX/XXXX/365 ).

Recently I learned that the awards that I have been accumulating for a number of years are now being removed from my account. I was told by GM from the very beginning that the awards would never expire, yet Goldman-Sachs has removed hundreds of dollars so far and stated they would continue to take regular monthly amounts until it reaches {$0.00}. They claimed that they could do this because I haven't used any reward dollars to buy a new car for over seven years. As I stated before this was never the case until now. Furthermore, I actually did purchase a new car well within the seven year restriction. The previous amount of reward dollars was approx. {$4700.00} and is now down to {$4100.00} and has been steadily dropping for the past year. I only noticed this recently as I have always been treated fairly and didn't suspect anything until this month. ( XX/XX/2023 ) I received no notification prior to their actions.

I received the card in XXXX XXXX  with a {$1500.00} credit limit. I had some financial emergencies in the fall of this year, fell behind on some payments ( not with my Apple Card ) and took out a loan from my XXXX to catch up. My bank told me the check would clear by XX/XX/XXXX but they decided to hold it longer because it was a large check ( I had to call the bank to correct ). I had made a payment to my Apple Card on XXXX but it was declined by my bank. I then made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX and called Goldman Sachs to tell them what happened. Because this payment was declined and other creditors reported that I had late payments, my credit limit was downgraded to {$800.00} on XXXX I did not know that this downgrade was happening and made payments totaling {$1400.00} on XXXX XXXX  and XXXX. 

Situation : I paid {$1400.00} and I spent {$600.00} by XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX they downgraded my credit limit from {$1500.00} to {$800.00}. Now they're saying that my only available credit is {$190.00}.

I have also noticed that there are certain errors, considerably affecting my credit report in a negative way. This account is already closed, but I am reporting late payments, which there is an inaccuracy of the dates, so I kindly ask that it be deleted from my history. 

This account presents inaccuracies in the 3 most important credit reports, giving a report only in XXXX. 

This account was disputed with your agencies in the past due to a charge that they generated for something that did not correspond to me giving an extremely high amount, which I do not recognize from this account at all. 

Attached you will find all the information corresponding to this dispute. 

For this reason, I kindly ask that this account be removed from my history which is found paid and closed. And it's only affecting me. 

I attach to this letter copies of documents supporting my claim that show that the data on my credit report is inaccurate. 

I ask that you conduct a full review of my credit report and take the necessary steps to correct the errors identified. I appreciate your attention and I look forward to your response as soon as possible.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","FL","33180","","Consent provided","Web",2023-07-06,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7207419,2023

I got an email the following day stating that my application was denied because """" we are unable to verify your identification information ''. I checked the information and applied again on XXXX with the same result. 
I called Apple Card support ( XXXX ) on XXXX to find out what was wrong ( I have a XXXX XXXX so gave permission for my husband to speak for me ). The representative told me to check that all my information was correct ( on my iPhone, Apple ID etc ) and be careful with uploading my ID card. I tried again using the Apple website and again got the """" unable to verify '' email. 
My husband and I carefully checked our credit reports at all three credit bureau ( XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ). All our information was correct. The only possible problem could be that XXXX had our previous apartment number as current despite also listing the more recent unit ( we moved within the same building one year ago ). We contacted XXXX to make this correction. 
Before applying again on XX/XX/XXXX, I called Apple to check if it was OK to proceed. The rep encouraged me to do so but my application was again denied because """" You have applied a number of times and we can not verify the information you have provided at this time ''. I called back and was told that I should wait a couple of days and then apply again. 
To be safe, I waited until XX/XX/XXXX before applying again but was again got the """" ... number of times ... '' email. I called Apple again to ask why this had happened after I had carefully followed their instructions. The rep said that she would transfer me to Apple ( XXXX ) to get help with the identification process. The new rep said she was with Apple support, didn't know why I'd been sent to her, and would transfer me to """" Goldman-Sachs XXXX XXXX In fact, this was back to Apple Card because, while the reps pretend they're speaking for the bank, they don't! This time, the rep told me that I should wait for 2-3 weeks before applying again. I asked to speak with a supervisor and explained the situation but was told she could do nothing. 
MY COMPLAINT Apple Card 's automated application system is like playing the lottery. Their representatives can not help and so are restricted to giving tips rather than providing factual advice to help customers solve problems that may occur. I was not told why my identification was unsuccessful, encouraged to try multiple times, and then prevented from applying again due to an unrevealed limit. This is not the way a serious and fair bank should operate. 
My husband applied in XXXX and was approved within minutes! We have the same addresses, high credit scores and income so why should I have so much trouble?","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","PA","19103","Older American","Consent provided","Web",2023-11-21,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7886385,2023

This worked well, and I was planning to upgrade to a new model. However, Apple and Goldman Sachs changed their terms, materially, earlier this year, while still advertising the product as it was originally conceived. The new terms require a cell phone plan with only a choice of the largest 3 carriers in the US. Apple says you do not need to keep it on that plan, but one is required for purchase, using the monthly installments. This leaves people like me who were relying on Apple to keep their promise in a situation where a new phone can only be purchased with a big 3 carrier plan, whereas before, it could be purchased """" on any carrier '' - which is still the case, but not with the monthly installments, which was 90 % the reason for me getting the card.

2023-12-29,"Payday loan, title loan, personal loan, or advance loan","Personal line of credit","Problem with additional add-on products or services","","On XX/XX/XXXX, two equal payments of {$260.00} were sent by ACH by my bank to GreenSky, a Goldman Sachs Company ( see receipts from XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX indicating that two payments were electronically made to GrenSky, with two different ACH trace numbers-Exhibits XXXX and XXXX respectively ). 
Due to concerns about the payments being applied as intended, I phoned GreenSky on at least two occasions to be sure that one payment was applied to the XXXX payment for the account and the other payment was applied to principle only, without interest being deducted from that payment, and was told on all occasions that the payments were applied correctly. I did not record the representatives names because I did not think it would come down to me having to file a formal complaint with the CFPB just to get the payments applied correctly and obtain proof positive that the payments had been applied correctly. 
Based on the assurance by GreenSky personnel, I did not think much more about it until, on or about XX/XX/XXXX, I received notification that my electronic statement was ready for download. I downloaded my XXXX statement which is payable XX/XX/XXXX. ( See Exhibit XXXX ). That statement alerted me that GreenSky had, in fact, received the double payment, totaling {$530.00} ( XXXX ) but did not give me a clear, concise indication as to how those payments were applied. 
I have had other telephone conversations about how the payments were applied and got the same answer as I received during my first conversations with GreenSky personnel-that the payments had been applied correctly. Again, on at least one occasion, I was told that the payments were applied correctly and again I did not record the representatives names because, giving GreenSky the benefit of the doubt, I assumed that GreenSky would be professional and apply the payments as I indicated they should be applied during our multiple telephone conversations, and did not think it would have to come down to me having to file a formal complaint with the CFPB just to get the payments applied correctly and obtain proof positive that the payments had been applied correctly. 
I began checking GreenSkys website regularly to be assured that the payments were applied as intended, although I did not download or take screen shots of what I was seeing online at the onset. I began communicating with GreenSky about the payments via secure messaging via their online portal ( See XXXX email chain regarding my communications with GreenSky, Exhibit XXXX. ) Finally, because I was not getting satisfaction and was not receiving the positive proof of how the payments were applied, I began downloading and taking screenshots of what I was seeing on the GreenSky website and even that was not a simple task inasmuch as the information was not readable/understandable because it had been scrambled despite me having logged in using my credentials. I lieu of printing out what I was seeing online due to printing issues, I took screen shots ( see Exhibits XXXX ). 
I have given GreenSky every opportunity to resolve the issue regarding the double payments and provide positive proof that the payments were applied as they should have been. Absolutely nothing lets me know how the payments were applied or that they were applied correctly and as of this writing, I still have not received the written proof that the payments were applied as they should have been. 
I regret that I have been pushed into filing a formal complaint, but it seems as though this is the only way to resolve the issue with XXXX. There are no clear, viable reasons not to be able to obtain a complete accounting of my account, letting me know exactly what they do with my money. Simply stating """" applied '' is not sufficient proof of exactly how the money is applied to the account and is not acceptable. 
It was/is my intent to begin paying down the principle and paying the loan off early and that has not and will not change. I'm either going to do it monthly by sending double payments to GreenSky and if they can not /will not provide me with an full accounting of how the money I send them is allocated, that is acceptable to me, then I will put the money aside to pay the loan off early and will collect the interest from that money until I do make a final payment, paying off the account. Either way, the loan is going to be paid off early. I have a double payment set up for XXXX but if I do not get the proof as to how the money I sent them in XXXX was allocated, that is acceptable to me, I will cancel the second payment intended for principle only, and send only the monthly payment and begin putting the money aside and collecting the interest until I make a lump sum payment to pay the loan off in its entirety, which will be before the loan 's maturity date. 
Until now, GreenSky and I have had a good relationship and it saddens me that something so simple, that they should be doing anyway, has tarnished that relationship.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","MS","396XX","Older American","Consent provided","Web",2024-01-03,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8077149,2023

Even though this is an Apple branded card, it is part of the XXXX network making this a standard credit card and is therefore bound by standard and customary rules and regulations for a credit card product. This would include how transactions are posted to the account and how information is reported to the three credit bureaus. However, Goldman Sachs is treating Apple transactions on this card as a """" loan '' product and reporting transactions to the credit bureaus as a credit card transaction, which they shouldn't be doing. Loans are regulated differently than credit card purchases. 

This is how they are doing it. Say your credit limit is {$2000.00}. As an Apple Card holder, Apple allows you to make a purchase and pay over time. It's a benefit of the card. You agree to pay a specific amount each month. Apple also offers a """" loan '' option via XXXXXXXX XXXX for the same monthly payment, further differentiating these two options as different products not alternatives to one another. The Apple Card is a credit card product and the XXXX XXXX option a loan product. 

Now say you make a {$1000.00} purchase with Apple and choose to take advantage of the card benefit and pay over time. Your monthly payment plan on the Apple Card is say {$50.00} but the product you purchased was say {$1000.00}. Goldman Sachs will take {$1000.00} out of your available credit of {$2000.00} and then your {$50.00} will go towards that {$1000.00} not the card itself, making this a loan within a credit card. Goldman Sachs will then report to the credit bureaus in a confusing and misleading way. They will report as if it's a credit card transaction, but they are treating the purchase as a loan. When it reports to the credit bureaus it will report with a """" balance '' on the card of {$1000.00} and your available credit is {$1000.00}. This then reports as a 50 % credit utilization rate which damages your credit score. Under FCRA you can not report one product as another product, that violates FCRA regulations. Apple and Goldman Sachs claim, well you as a consumer agreed to their terms and conditions therefore, they can do whatever accounting maneuvering they want and this some how gives them a """" pass '' from abiding by any corporate accounting and banking regulatory laws.

I am writing to express my deep concern and frustration regarding the recent issues I have been facing with my Apple Card account. Over the last month, I have noticed mysterious charges appearing on my balance repeatedly. Each time I call to address the problem, the charges are credited, but to my dismay, they reoccur again later. A formal inquiry has been lodged with the Apple Card dispute department, and I have been informed that the matter should be resolved by Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 
However, my primary concern lies with the accuracy and clarity of the Apple Card Credit Card Statements. I only discovered statement issues when I decided to investigate these mysterious charges further by reviewing the statements. Allow me to outline the transactions that led up to the issues : 1. On XX/XX/XXXX, an unauthorized charge of {$2.00} was made by Apple XXXX without my consent. 
2. On XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX Statement was published, including the {$2.00} charge. As I was unaware of this charge, I did not make the payment. 
3. On XX/XX/XXXX, the {$2.00} charge accrued {$0.00} in interest. 
4. On XX/XX/XXXX, my XXXX notified me of my Apple Card Account being past due, prompting me to dispute the XX/XX/XXXX charge. 
5. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a purchase of two XXXX totaling {$970.00} from Apple using the Apple Card, opting for a XXXX-month installment plan with 0 % APR. 
6. On XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that the tax for the XXXX  was not part of the installment plan and was instead placed on the APR Balance with a variable APR. 
7. I subsequently set up my bank to pay XXXX installments of {$81.00} each month ( XXXX ). 
8. On XX/XX/XXXX, my bank paid Apple Card {$81.00}, resulting in interest charges for the tax on the XXXX as it was not included in the installments. 
9. On XX/XX/XXXX, the Apple Card XXXX Statement was published, and my XXXX received a notification that my account was past due. 
10. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I paid the APR balance of {$81.00}, and Apple Card credited the interest. However, both the Apple Card Specialist and I believed that only {$81.00} was owed. 
The main issues I have encountered with the statements are as follows : 1. XXXX Statement : The statement appears to show an APR balance of {$81.00}, but it is actually {$84.00}. The statement should begin with the XXXX APR Balance, with subsequent transactions calculated accordingly, and the last line reflecting the XXXX APR balance. 
2. XXXX and XXXX Statements : These statements are very confusing and lack transparency in several areas : a ) Payments are posted to the statement, but it is unclear how much of the payments are applied to the APR balance. b ) The 0 % monthly installment calculation is not clearly presented on the statements. c ) Similar to the XXXX statement, the XXXX and XXXX statements suffer from inaccuracies in the """" Balance Subject to Interest '' section, which hinders a clear understanding of the account status. 
It is my belief that if Apple Card provided more transparent and comprehensible statements, such issues could be quickly identified and addressed. In light of these difficulties, I have included the statements from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX for your review. 
I kindly request a prompt resolution to these matters and that necessary steps be taken to ensure the accuracy and clarity of future statements. Your cooperation in resolving these concerns would be greatly appreciated.

XXXX : I realize the transfer request had been cancelled. Contacted Marcus through on-line chat help in the Marcus web site. Was told help could not be provided through chat and needed to call. Called the provided phone number, and after talking to a CSR and a specialist, that there was an attempt to verify the transfer by phone. Since the verification was not completed the transfer was cancelled. They would now confirm the transfer, and I should re-initiate the transfer request through the same on-line transfer process as before. I then went to the web site and requested the same amount be transferred to the same verified back as the XXXX transfer request. The phone call required approximately 30 minutes. 

XXXX : checked my account for the status of the transfer. Did not see that any transfer request had been made. Again, initiated a transfer request for the same amount to the same verified bank as the XXXX transfer request. Upon completion I received an error message on the web site indicating that there was some system trouble, and I should try again in a few hours. 

XXXX : returned to the web site. Confirmed that there was no pending transfer. Again, re-initiated a transfer request for the same amount to the same verified bank as the XXXX request. Received the same error message on the web site as seen on XXXX. Called the help number shown on the Marcus web site. The CSR could not complete the transfer herself and needed assistance from a specialist. After being put on hold 5 times waiting for a specialist, I cancelled my request to the CSR for the transfer. Instead, I requested that the account be closed, and all of the funds in the account be moved to the credit union account that was initially used to fund the Marcus account. This also required specialist assistance, and being placed on several holds. At one point I was kicked back to the automated answering system and needed to go through the process of explaining the concern again. There was also a request by Marcus to have the secondary account holder verify the closure of the account. I had the secondary account holder verify with me to close the account, and was told this would be completed in 1-3 business days. In total this phone call required 90 minutes. 

XXXX : The secondary account holder received a phone message that there was a concern with the account closure. After returning the call she was told that the account could not be closed without the primary account holder confirming the closure again because there was a fraud hold put on the account. Since the primary account holder was not available, he would need to call in to the Marcus help line later. Although requested, the CSR could not give a direct phone number to reach the same person to complete this, and the call would need to go through the same help phone process as previously done. This phone call took 60 minutes. 

XXXX : I ( the primary account holder ) called in to the help line and informed the CSR that I had been requested to call in and speak with the fraud department. She placed me on hold for a few minutes, and after returned confirmed that I was trying to close the account. She then went through the process of re-confirming the closure of the account and informed me that the funds would be in the requested credit union account in 1-3 business days. I reconfirmed that this meant Wednesday would be the latest day I should see the funds, and the CSR confirmed. This phone call took approximately 15 minutes. 

XXXX : Received an email stating that someone from Marcus had been trying to call me, but could not reach me, and requesting a call back. I confirmed both phone numbers on the Marucs account, and neither had received any phone calls that day. I called into the help line and spoke briefly with a CSR. She then placed me on hold twice in order to reach a specialist. XXXXXXXX the specialist then confirmed my information, sent a 1-time PIN to my phone which I confirmed, and confirmed an in-coming transfer from XXXX. After that she informed me that a 3-way call with my credit union was necessary because a hold was placed on my account. Since the credit union was closed for the day, she informed me that I would need to call back tomorrow to have this 3-way conversation. The phone call took approximately 30 minutes. 

XXXX : I called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to inform them that Marucs would be calling to have a 3-way call to confirm information. They informed me that they dont normally do this, since they have no way to confirm who is in the call. However, they agreed that they could give out limited information. I agreed to give them permission to give out this limited information to Marcus by Goldman Sachs. This phone call took approximately 20 minutes. 

XXXX : I called Marcus to initiate the 3-way call. I spoke to the CSR and explained that I was calling back to initiate this call, and he would likely need to get a specialist for assistance. He agreed and placed me on hold to get assistance. He then came back and explained the specialists were busy and he needed to continue to ask me to wait. This repeated 2 more times, requesting to repeat the hold process. The final time he informed me that there was a restriction on my account placed by either the state or the IRS, and I would need to contact them to clear this up. He could not identify who had placed this restriction. After I complained that this was another new concern for transferring money that Marucs was bringing up, as in similar attempts Ive made, I asked to speak with a supervisor. After another hold period a supervisor discussed further and informed me that the IRS had placed a garnishment on my account, and they could not remove it without the IRSs permission. I asked when this occurred, and she was unable to tell me. After some further prodding about what was going on, she asked me to hold while she contacted a specialist. When she returned, she informed me that only a 3-way call with my credit union was required to clear up the concern on my account, and transferred me to a specialist to complete this. The specialist, XXXX, placed me on hold to contact the credit union. When she returned, she a person from the credit union on the line. I explained to him that I wanted to close my Marcus account, and transfer the balance to my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account. XXXX then explained that she needed to confirm a few items with him, before this could be completed. She asked him to confirm the last four digits of my social security number, my birthdate and my address, all of which she read to him, and he confirmed they were correct. Then she let him go from the call. She then informed me that she would complete the closure and transfer to my credit union. I asked if there was anything else that needed to be done to complete the closure and transfer the funds, and she replied that nothing else was needed. I then mentioned that when I last spoke to someone at Marucs who was closing the account ( XXXX ) they told me it would be 1-3 business days to transfer the funds, which would make the completion date by Wednesday. I asked her to confirm that the funds would still be transferred by tomorrow, and she confirmed. This phone call took a little more than 1 hour. 

XXXX : There doesn't appear to be any closure or transfer initiated on my Marcus account, and there is no receivpt of funds on my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","OH","43040","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-26,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8056280,2023

2023-05-18,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Managing an account","Deposits and withdrawals","Dear CFPB, I am writing to file a complaint against Goldman Sachs regarding their arrogant, unreasonable, and unlawful practices regarding my credit card and saving account. 

Recently, I applied for a Goldman Sachs credit card through Apple and also opened a saving account. When I attempted to withdraw cash back from this card, I discovered that the card was issued in the name of XXXX XXXX, while my legal name, as stated on all my identification documents and XXXX XXXX records, is XXXX XXXX. Consequently, I am unable to make withdrawals. 

I have made numerous attempts to contact Goldman Sachs to resolve this issue, but they continuously transfer me from one customer service representative to another. 

I explicitly pointed out that the problem lies with Goldman Sachs using a name that has no legal basis to open my bank account. I spent a considerable amount of time proving this by calling my bank, XXXX. I fail to understand why Goldman Sachs can not simply change the name on my credit card to my legal name. 

When I was transferred to another bank representative, they informed me that if I wanted to change the name, I would need to provide court documents as proof. 

I am utterly perplexed. It is clear that Goldman Sachs made the error in my name, yet they expect me to provide court evidence. All my legal documents, such as my U.S. driver 's license and Social Security Number, bear the name XXXX XXXX. How can I provide court evidence to change my name to XXXX XXXX? 

The actions of this bank are not only arrogant but also illegal. They have allowed me to deposit money into an account with a name that lacks any legal supporting documentation. Furthermore, they unreasonably demand that I provide court documents. 

I urge the relevant authorities to closely monitor Goldman Sachs. They attract funds with high interest rates of 4.15 % while maintaining chaotic management. Such circumstances often lead to misappropriation of funds. For the safety of the U.S. financial system and the security of all small clients, it is crucial to expose this menace. 

Thank you.

I have submitted applications /securities/promissory notes 2 additional times in XX/XX/XXXX after recording over 20+ emails to Preview my new credit limit. And after receiving denials, I received 10+ additional advertisements. I initially was excited receiving the email because I thought I was approved all this time while experiencing financial difficulties and I thought that was a means of an end to the issues. Just to see that I was completely denied. This is considered bait and switch. This is false and misleading representation. I have also read on their documents on the Security Exchange Commission and saw that they are securitizing our applications and pooling them into trusts to trade across the secondary market ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) after turning the application over to get the Original Issue Discount from the Treasury Department without giving me MY EXTENSION OF CREDIT. They are committing securities fraud and they are not reporting anything to the IRS which is now going into tax evasion. I sent an email in response and no one responded. I then called the investment line and explained my issues and the individual had a supervisor call me back and that individual stated they do not have to comply with UCC, they do not go off of third party websites ( SEC.gov ) and stated the decision is final.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","OH","45239","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-23,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8047725,2023

The first person I talked to said the account couldnt be closed because I had recently updated my email address on their website. The next 2 people I talked to said someone would have to call me back and Id have to give them a one-time 4 digit PIN. The first time, I was told someone would call me as soon as our call ended. They didnt call. I called back after over 30 minutes. After being put on hold 3 times, I was told again that someone would call to ask for the PIN but this time it would take 20 to 30 minutes for them to call for the PIN. There was no call back for several hours. I cant hang around for hours and keep my phone line open waiting for Marcus by Goldman Sacks to call. 
They also require me to be at home to sign for the check sent via USPS. That would certainly be another delay. 
Seems clear that this is a runaround to avoid closing a CD thats paying only a third of a percentage point interest.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NC","27615","","Consent provided","Web",2023-03-29,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6658049,2023

I have exhausted all reasonable efforts to resolve this matter directly with the issuer, Apple, but the issue remains unresolved despite numerous attempts. Here are the details of the situation : On XXXX, XXXX, I initially set up a XXXX order, and subsequently canceled the order after the initial trial period. Between XXXX and XXXX, no charges appeared on my Apple Card account, indicating that the cancellation was successful. On XX/XX/XXXX, an unauthorized charge of {$77.00} was authorized on my Apple Card account by the merchant. I promptly disputed these unauthorized charges on XX/XX/XXXX, with Apple Card customer service. Disputes were filed again on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, as the unauthorized charges were not rectified. The charges for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, were recently reversed. However, these reversals came after multiple disputes were filed, indicating that the charges were indeed unauthorized. Throughout this process, new card numbers were issued each time by Apple due to the unauthorized charges. Despite this, the unauthorized charges continued to occur due to Apple 's participation in an updater program with the merchant. Apple acknowledged in my communications with their customer service that the updater program does not function as intended in the case of unauthorized charges, demonstrating their own awareness of the issue. I have made diligent efforts to resolve this matter with Apple, but their failure to prevent unauthorized charges and their lack of effective action have led me to this point of filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The recurring unauthorized charges, despite multiple disputes and new card numbers issued, have caused considerable frustration and financial inconvenience. I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau intervene and investigate this matter on my behalf to ensure that these unauthorized charges are properly resolved, and appropriate measures are taken to prevent such incidents in the future. At a minimum, I am asking that they credit my account for the charges that were reversed for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( and to really honor their zero liability pledge, the dispute for XX/XX/XXXX should also be honored ). I believe that it is in the best interest of consumers to have a secure and reliable financial system, and Apple 's inadequate response raises concerns about their commitment to protecting their customers ' financial well-being. Enclosed with this letter, please find copies of relevant documents, including communication records with Apple, transaction statements, and dispute documentation. I appreciate your attention to this matter and thank you for your assistance in resolving this issue. I look forward to a prompt resolution and your valuable support in holding companies accountable for their actions.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","CO","80111","","Consent provided","Web",2023-09-19,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7574160,2023
2023-03-04,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem when making payments","Problem during payment process","On XX/XX/, I made a payment in the amount of {$1200.00} and this payment got held. I totally understand the reason that this payment was held due to me making an unusually high payment. I would make a comment that prior to this payments like {$25.00}, {$75.00}, {$100.00}, {$120.00} were not placed on hold. Now no matter what, this bank is holding payments, which makes no sense to me. I have spoken to representatives that state the reason that payments are being held is that of payment cancellations, but that is false, because I never started truly cancelling payments like I have recently when I noticed that everything was going to be held for not even 7 days but 10+ days now. I understand this if I bounced a payment, but seems like these XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX  can't trust they will get money themselves while they line their own XXXX  pockets. I feel like this is an advantage to continue collecting additional interest on my account. My account needs to be returned to credit payments same day, as this is I think extremely unfair that now these people arbitrarily do whatever whenever however they feel and DO NOT inform the borrower. I think that credit card companies if they are holding payments need to explain to the consumer how come and when it will be released. They do not do this. It is biased and somewhat racist.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","IL","60654","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2023-03-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6647878,2023

I got an email this morning notifying me that they had lowered my credit limit from {$2500.00} to {$1000.00}. The stated reason is : Your XXXX credit report shows you have recently been past due on another credit card account. In fact, this reasoning is false. I pulled my report after receiving the email and it shows no derogatory activity since 2019, well before this account was opened. I have received no correspondence from my current creditors that I am past due at all, much less more than 30 days to have this information appear on my credit report. 

I called and first spoke with a representative who identified herself as a supervisor ( I did not ask for a supervisor, I simply got one ). She stated I would have to obtain the credit report TU furnished. It seemed as though she believed it was most likely there was simply information on the report I was not aware of because she asked if I was getting my information directly from XXXX  or a third party like XXXX XXXX. I informed her I had a contradictory credit report more recent than the email, directly from XXXX. She advised that I call XXXX anyway. So, I called XXXX and was informed that my current copy of the report was the same information that was furnished to Goldman Sachs. They said this would be something to dispute with the creditor directly, since my credit report doesn't actually contain any recent derogatory information. 

I called Goldman Sachs back and reached another representative. He apologized for the inconvenience and informed me that this is an automatic process, he can not see why beyond the stated reason, and my only recourse is to apply for a limit increase in the future. He said he would note my concern on the account, but that there was nothing he could do. 

Goldman Sachs admittedly has no escalation/dispute process for something like this, or they are being elusive in offering it. They assume that their system correctly assigned adverse action, and that if there are any issues I must contact the credit bureau ( the adverse action email says as much ). The only thing that makes sense is that they are using my bankruptcy and the accounts discharged in it, which occurred years prior to my account opening with them, against me now, when they did not choose to use it against me when I applied for an account in the first place. Or perhaps it's an inexplicable system error. I don't know, they can't tell me, and it doesn't make sense. I can provide a copy of the credit report on demand to prove this. 

I do not know what rights if any I have to dispute this, but it's literally not an honest business practice to deal with a consumer based on false information and then refuse to investigate its accuracy.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","CA","91941","","Consent provided","Web",2023-09-26,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7601000,2023

This happened in XXXX of 2022 but he has been logged in and monitoring my activities for much longer, once again, without my knowledge or permission. He has since been impersonating me ( digitally ) and apple refuses to shut the account down. I have called them numerous times to try to resolve the issue but they always treat me like I am the criminal/identity thief. I still had the physical card and had to use it all the way to the credit limit because my ex has been financially abusive towards me. Apple let me make every charge in that card but will not give me access to make payments. That appleid had my entire life on it including years of photos of me and our XXXX kids. He knows everything about me such as social security number and all other information that identifies me. This knowledge, along with the photos, has granted him access to take over my entire life. I can not even get rental assistance because I believe he is also receiving this in my name. I am struggling immensely due to this and they refuse to help me. I did not want to close the card because I knew my credit would take a huge it but finally I broke down and clised it even though there is a {$2000.00} balance.

It still said I have another account when I tried. I was then told I would not be able to so that until it is paid off and maybe not even then if I am niot approved due to a low credit score. This has been a complete nightmare for me. I do not understand how the credit card can not be untied from the stolen appleid. It is the same as if a physical credit card was stolen and all other credt card companies will immediately shut down a stolen credit card. Actually it is much worse because this account verifies my identity for any other online account. It is impossible that Apple does not realize how devastating this is so I feel they just so not care what happens to a single mother who is struggling simply because I have a measly little {$2000.00} credit limit. I am simply not worth their time. My time, on the other hand, is consumed by this. Time that I was unable to spend with my children as they are growing older.

A few months ago, I fell victim to an identity theft incident wherein my XXXX login credentials were stolen and subsequently disseminated on dark web markets.

Upon discovering these fraudulent activities, I promptly filed reports with both the local police department and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ). Copies of these reports were forwarded to the major credit bureaus XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX as part of my dispute process.

Despite my subsequent exercise of this right by mailing a notice to Apple Card, explicitly denying consent to share my personal information with third parties, Apple Card reported my account information to the top three Credit Reporting Agencies ( CRA ) without adhering to my Opt Out request. 

Recognizing this as an impermissible disclosure of my personal information and identity theft, I promptly disputed these items with the CRAs and provided them with copies of my Affidavit and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) Identity Theft Report. As a result of my dispute, the account and related inquiry were immediately removed from my credit reports.

In response to my exercise of privacy rights under the GLBA and FCRA, Apple Card, issued by Goldman Sachs, engaged in discriminatory actions against me, constituting a violation of 15 USC 1691 ( a ) ( 3 ). Apple Card retaliated by closing my Apple Card account, citing """" There was a failure to comply with the terms of the Customer Agreement. '' I wish to emphasize that the Customer Agreement 's section on """" Credit Information & Credit Reporting '' does not provide a compliant GLBA and FCRA disclosure, which is required by federal law. This disclosure should clearly explain consumers ' rights under the GLBA, specifically the right to Opt Out of third-party sharing, and the consequences of non-compliance by the financial institution.

Furthermore, after closing my account, Apple Card re-furnished the account information back to my credit report as """" verified. '' This action is unwarranted and in direct violation of the FCRA, given that my dispute led to the removal of this information.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","WA","98058","","Consent provided","Web",2023-10-08,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7663863,2023

The offer was for XXXX Bonus points when you spend {$200.00} thru XX/XX/23.

When I called Golden Sachs, the agent could not answer my question and asked me to submit a written request so they could research it, which I did. 

Today on XX/XX/23, I received a call from a customer service agent at Goldman Sachs. She advised that I did not qualify for the promotion because any Returns or Payments that posted to my account would have been subtracted from the Spend total that would count towards the Rewards Promotion. I told her I definitely understand Returns being subtracted, but subtracting Payments ( thus making them count against a cardholder ) makes no sense. By doing that, Goldman Sachs is penalizing cardholders for keeping their accounts current and/or paying more than the Min Pay Due. I also told her that was not disclosed in the Promotion.

The customer service agent was adamant that is how the Promo is supposed to work, and offered to walk me thru their Rewards Terms & Conditions to prove it. She pulled up her copy and I followed along online using a link in my online account. She read thru every section tied to Rewards Offers/Promos and there was absolutely nothing even close to stating that Payments would be subtracted from the amount used to calculate Spend ; but she still stuck to her guns, stating it would fall under other terms & conditions. 

I was reminded at the beginning and throughout the call that we were being recorded, so our entire conversation is on a call recording at Goldman Sachs.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NE","68116","","Consent provided","Web",2023-08-19,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7424352,2023

On the aforementioned date, I received a notification from Apple Card stating that my card had been """" restricted. '' The notification did not provide any specific details or reasons for this restriction, leaving me bewildered and worried about the status of my card. 

The only potential reason I can fathom for the restriction is a transaction I made on Friday morning ( XXXX monthly installment for {$880.00} ), which may have been deemed unusual by the company 's systems. However, I promptly verified this transaction through the Apple Card app, confirming that it was indeed me making the charge. I expected this action to resolve any issues related to the transaction and assumed that my card would function normally thereafter. 

Subsequently, I received a phone call from Apple Card, which I missed due to a prior commitment at work. I have since been diligently attempting to contact the company to gain clarification regarding the card restriction and to resolve this matter. Unfortunately, my attempts to reach out to Apple Card have been met with limited success. The only response I have received is that my card is currently under review, with no indication of a specific timeframe for resolution or further communication. 

This situation has left me feeling not only frustrated but also concerned about my financial security and the protection of my personal information. The lack of transparency and information provided by Apple Card regarding the reasons for the card restriction is deeply troubling. It leaves customers like me in the dark and without proper knowledge of why our cards have been restricted, thereby hindering our ability to address and rectify the situation. 

I firmly believe that this situation is not only unfair but also unacceptable. As a loyal customer, I deserve to have my concerns addressed promptly and to be informed about the status and reasons for any actions taken on my account. I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigates this matter thoroughly and ensures that Apple Card takes appropriate measures to rectify this issue promptly. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a swift resolution. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information or clarification regarding this complaint.

It is also worth noting that Goldman Sachs has refused to take into account the confirmation from both the merchant and the merchant 's website that the transaction was unsuccessful.

2023-10-17,"Credit card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem with a purchase shown on your statement","Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement","Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint against Goldman Sachs and Apple Credit Card , for practices that I believe to be unjust, potentially deceptive, and in violation of our agreed-upon contract terms. The transactions posted to the account on XX/XX/2023, XX/XX/2023, and XX/XX/2023. Initially I opened the disputes on XX/XX/2023, and XX/XX/2023. 

I agreed with XXXX for the development of a custom-coded website and related services. The issues began with what I perceive to be an unreasonable charge of 18 billable hours for a simple monogram design, a figure that is grossly inconsistent with industry standards. 

Moreover, the project, which caused a phased approach, encountered insurmountable hurdles when the merchant refused to implement specific feature requests. These features were not only integral to the project 's success, but were also services that the merchant explicitly advertised. Their refusal effectively rendered the contract void, as the services promised were not delivered. 

Despite numerous attempts to resolve these issues through Goldman Sachs, the responses have been unsatisfactory and, from my standpoint, display a clear bias towards the merchant. My concerns seem to be dismissed without a thorough investigation, and the evidence I've presented has been, in my view, largely ignored. 

I've meticulously reviewed the evidence provided by the merchant, and I'm baffled by the conclusions drawn by Apple Credit Card Services. Here 's where things don't add up : 1. Yes, there was a contract, which isn't in dispute. However, the crux of the matter is the merchant 's failure to fulfill their contractual obligations. They've produced no solid proof that the website was fully developed to the agreed specifications, nor is there any indication that I gave my stamp of approval on a completed site. 

2. The merchant did provide evidence of my initial approval of the logo and the website 's preliminary design. However, this in no way justifies billing XXXX XXXX  of the hours for merely XXXX XXXX of the entire scope of work. The math just doesnt work out.

3. The most glaring issue, which both the merchant and Apple Card Services have chosen to overlook repeatedly, is the absolute lack of custom coding involved in the website 's creation. The merchant 's advertising explicitly included custom coding in the package I purchased. This omission is not a minor oversight ; it's a fundamental breach of contract. Yet, this critical point is being willfully ignored, resulting in the merchant being unjustly rewarded with their transaction fees, while I'm left grappling with unwarranted charges. 

This situation doesn't just raise a red flag ; it's a glaring signal of a process that has, in my view, gone seriously awry. The merchant 's failure to deliver on key contract elements and the subsequent financial implications for me are concerns that I believe warrant immediate and thorough review. 

I have enclosed all relevant documentation, including the original contract, email correspondence, and promotional materials from the merchant that clearly state the inclusion of custom coding services. 

I respectfully request the CFPB to comprehensively review this matter and to consider possible violations of consumer protection laws. Furthermore, I seek guidance on how to proceed with this issue, as traditional resolution avenues have proven to be ineffective. 

I appreciate your prompt attention to this serious matter and look forward to the opportunity to discuss this further. Please contact me. 

Thank you for your time and assistance.

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I opened a CD account ending 8604 with interest rate at 1.98030 % ( 2 % ) for 24 months with an initial deposit of {$250000.00} ( fund was raised from the entire family ).

Instead of earning interest for the 5 months ( XXXX XXXX ), ended up I had to pay over {$2000.00}. That's a rip off, in sin and unacceptable. Marcus is worse than a loan shark. Is such an illegal activity being monitored by the government?

I strongly believe Marcus is a big SCAM on this penalty. I wish could step in and help to get our hard earned money back. Thanks.

I have had the account for a couple years and have established a track record of making full payments, each month, on time. 
I have diligently been making payments each month over the last 3 months, but have relentlessly been charged interest and have not been offered any help with the continual charges, notwithstanding my longtime account member status. 
In addition, the interest calculator tool has been incorrect, and the system increases the amount of interest in large excess than what it states it will be as the month goes along. 
I have been charged over {$250.00} in interest over the last 4 months despite proactively reaching out to ask for disaster relief ( stemming from XXXX damage to my family member 's home in FL ) and health crisis considerations. When I call, I receive discourteous, unhelpful service, along with false promises about what interest can be waived and what can be done for my account. 
Additionally, I was told that I couldn't receive any help since I had already made the minimum payment in a given month and to call back early the next month ( which means that I'm being penalized for making as many payments as possible! ). However, when I called back the next month before making any payments, I was told I STILL could not receive any assistance. 
Apple Card has been the worst experience, from a customer service standpoint, imaginable. As a comparison, when I called XXXX with a similar request, I was given a XXXX interest waiver and an offer to be put on a zero-interest plan for 12 months.

I called them immediately, and they walked me through the convoluted process of setting up the XXXX XXXX and then provided me with detailed instructions for making payments by check through the mail. None of the information I received at the Apple Store turned out to be correct. ( 1 ) In order to function properly your XXXXXXXX XXXX must match your current email address.

2023-11-17,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","Domestic (US) money transfer","Money was not available when promised","","I initiated a wire transfer as part of a home buying process for $ XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, there were no questions asking about what type of account it was. I was informed on XX/XX/XXXX that Marcus by Goldman Sachs did not transfer out to Trust accounts- this makes no sense as they do wire to external escrow/title companies on a case by case basis. This initially delayed the process. I was then forced to change the type of account at my receiving bank. 

I initiated another wire transfer on Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. This was after the wire cut off time and was informed that the wire would be processed next day but may take 1-3 business days. I asked that the wire be expedited and was told that it could not be. I noted that this was very time sensitive and we needed the funds transferred over to meet the close date for our mortgage closing process for a new home. I followed up the next day after the transfer did not complete and asked what could be done, and the representative escalated to a manager to expedite, I was told it was through the first verification and would be ready. I called to check in this morning at XXXX EST to check and re-iterated that in order to meet close, I needed them to verify the wire transfer this morning ( Thursday ) - they said it had not in fact been verified. They had no way of contacting the department in charge of verification and no updates beyond that the wire was in queue. I was told to call in in an hour to check. I called multiple times today and there was no change and no insight into what stage of the process it was in. The wire has still not transferred. In fact the bank 's notes incorrectly said that I told them that I needed funds by Friday - I told them no fewer than 6 times in the last 3 days that I HAD to have the funds by Thursday AM. Understood that they say 1-3 business days, but the communication has been poor and there is no accountability about how to manage the wire process and intercept and escalate if there are issues. We are now going into the third business day, which essentially means the expediting was meaningless. We have now missed the deadline for our close of escrow. Everyone felt bad for me but they were powerless to do anything. 

Generally speaking as a commercial bank Marcus by Goldman has failed in my eyes. My money is held hostage as it clears wire transfer timing, the rules behind where you can/ca n't wire to are not clearly articulated- especially at time of wire which I did OVER THE PHONE, and we missed close and there was no accountability.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","CA","94114","","Consent provided","Web",2023-11-17,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7860273,2023

It is my knowledge that several customers were given a goodwill credit in the amount of {$100.00} due to the lag in processing of outgoing withdrawals. In XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, Goldman Sachs had extremely negative user reviews and several articles published within multiple news sources that described the failure of Goldman to properly process withdrawals, which dissuaded me from attempting to withdrawal from my account, especially in the month of XXXX. Upon contacting Goldman, I was informed that a case was submitted to review my request for a goodwill credit by representative XXXX, my case number was XXXX. I received a follow up phone call from supervisor XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2023, at approximately XXXX, informing me that my request had been denied. When I questioned why, I was informed that it was because Goldman conducted an internal review and identified impacted customers. The reason I did not attempt a withdrawal is due to the serious issues many consumers faced in the month of XXXX, all of which are clearly available to view with a simple XXXX search. I requested a formal letter be produced so I could forward to the CFPB, and I was told the matter needed to be reviewed with Goldman 's Legal and Compliance Teams and that I would receive a call back. On XX/XX/2023, at XXXX I received an email stating that Goldman was unable to reach me and to utilize the chat feature within the Apple Card Wallet app to get in touch. I did so, and spoke with a XXXX, who transferred my chat to a supervisor, XXXX, who informed me that he had escalated my request for a formal letter and that I needed to """" check back with them in 2 days ''. I am extremely frustrated with the lack of responsiveness, the lack of empathy, and the disparate treatment I have received from Goldman Sachs. I am requesting that my goodwill credit request be honored as I AM an affected customer. Goldman 's declination to provide me this credit could be considered disparate treatment. Goldman neglected to provide thorough Account Disclosures at the time of account opening, and lacked directive on how long funds transfers would take when initiating a withdrawal, which has since been updated. Please advocate on my behalf to get this credit approved. No one should have to spend hours chatting and calling to get told the exact same thing, that it was escalated and to check back.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NY","14225","","Consent provided","Web",2023-07-25,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7302140,2023

2023-08-31,"Credit card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Fees or interest","Charged too much interest","I've had at least 6 phone calls with Goldman to resolve this issue. First phone call in mid-XXXX  was to inquire about my XXXX balance as the statement shown didn't add up. 

A case was opened as person I spoke with couldnt explain it. I called twice to check on case progress as my payment was coming due. It took 3 weeks for me to receive an incomplete response in XXXX to my original inquiry. While waiting for this response my payment was coming due. I called to inquire on progress and explicitly asked how to handle the upcoming payment and was told that because I had disputed the balance, I would not be charged interest. 

In fact, I was charged interest and the card company is refusing to refund all the interest charges. This is my first ever partial payment and I want to be clear, I made a partial payment under the companys representation to me that interest would not be charged. If the associate made a mistake in providing this guidance, it is not on me and I shouldnt have to pay. 

To add, it took an additional 3 people, each at a higher level, and over 2 hours on the phone to finally explain my balance discrepancy. In fact, during my 6th call, the manager that called me almost gave up and wanted to create a case to be reviewed. Goldmans obscure accounting of my activity and balances led to several different explanations as to the discrepancy in my purchase activity and total balance due. At one point telling me that the extra balance due was due to incomplete XXXX payment when I had it on autopay for full amount and was told the reason interest was not charged in XXXX was due to some weird accounting done by Goldman. Turns out that was not the case, but again, it took an additional phone call and an extra hour to resolve the mystery. 

I took every action to ensure I would pay my balance on time. I called Goldman several times to get an explanation of the balance due, I called to inquire about case status before payment was due, and I explicitly asked how to handle the upcoming payment and was told that because it was in dispute, no charges would accrue if I didnt make payment. Luckily, I did pay the majority of the balance on time. I didnt pay the amount I could not understand, and no one could explain to me in a timely manner, why it was being charged. Goldmans inability to explain its own statements and the incorrect information provided to me can not possibly be my problem to pay for.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NY","10552","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2023-08-31,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7484293,2023

There is an on-going identify theft alert in my name with FTC. Ive also put a year fraud alert with credit companies for this entire year. Please re-open an investigation for this fraud case on my behalf. Furthermore, I have also enclosed a police report for the illegitimate charges as well circumstances that have caused the identify theft in the first place.

I can not see anything on my end I have no access to see what is happening to my account. However, I was afraid of interest would accrued on the card I just kept paying until I was able to reach out. They never returned my emails or phone calls and I'm left in the dark on why my fraud claim isn't resolved. As explained when I have reached out to them about those charges, which I can't see since my account was closed without notice, that are fraudulent due to identity fraud. 

They recently claimed they found not fraud on my account which is inconsistent to what I have originally reported to them. My phone was lost with my wallet, my virtual card is on that phone. How can you not find fraudulent activities on my card when that happened?? 
Moreover, I don't have access to this email address XXXX anymore because it was hacked into when I lost my phone.

2023-06-12,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Closing an account","Funds not received from closed account","In XX/XX/2023 I opened an HYS account with Marcus by Goldman Sachs as it came recommended by my financial advisor. My request to open the account was promptly approved on XXXX XXXX and I transferred {$100.00} as an initial deposit to make sure everything was was working fine. The transfer went smooth and without any problem so after almost two weeks, I transferred {$20000.00} of savings into this account. Following that transfer I categorized the money into three separate categories/sub-accounts. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email informing me that my account and funds were frozen and that action was required. I promptly called customer support and to my surprise they claimed that Goldman Sachs had trouble verifying my identify without specifying why. It was agreed that I was to be sent an affidavit to verify my identify with a notary. As I split my time between the XXXX and XXXX it was necessary for me to go to the US consulate in XXXX ( XXXX ) as that per definition is US soil. My identity was successfully verified and notarized with the name and authority of the notary as well as the seal of the US government. The original documents alongside a verified copy of my US passport were overnighted to Goldman Sachs. Contrary to customer support claiming that this procedure would be fine, Goldman Sachs dismissed the evidence submitted and permanently closed my account. This endeavour alone cost me around {$300.00}. Goldman Sachs did not reach out to resolve the issue and I was only provided with an automated e-mail notifying me of the closing on XX/XX/XXXX after having attempted to reach out multiple times via phone in order to try and resolve the issue. At least 6 attempts by myself to resolve the issue over phone were dismissed by both customer support and specialists claiming there was either nothing that could be done or that no information could be provided over phone. In addition, no one was willing to discuss why I was allowed to be able to transfer funds and fully use a bank account and associated services without Goldman Sachs apparently having even verified the identify of the bank account holder. 

I was never given back the funds that I initially transferred and Goldman Sachs showed no meaningful willingness to resolve the issue claiming that the bank was unable to transfer back the funds.They informed me that the only way to obtain my funds back was by filing a claim with the bank where the funds originated from ( XXXX XXXX ). Upon multiple requests Goldman Sachs claimed they were unaware of where the funds were and that the account could not be accessed. On XXXX XXXX, one customer service representative told me that my funds ( including interest ) had been transferred back to the XXXX XXXX account the funds originated from on XXXX XXXX. I was provided with this input after having received misleading information about the whereabouts of my money for about 1.5 months. I was provided with the transferred amounts and transfer numbers and promised to receive more detailed information by mail. Goldman Sachs considered the situation resolved and claimed this issue was now between me and XXXX XXXX. I never received the promised information by mail and XXXX XXXX specialists were puzzled over the ( 1 ) Goldman Sachs ' handling of the situation and ( 2 ) their claim that this was a XXXX XXXX issue. XXXX XXXX never received the funds and was unable to verify the Goldman Sachs provided information. XXXX XXXX informed me that unless money was fraudulently taken there was nothing that could be done on their end. Confronting Goldman Sachs with this information yielded no success and it was repeatedly attempted to send me back to XXXX XXXX claiming there was nothing Goldman Sachs could do or had to do with the situation. 

I have had no access to my funds since XXXX XXXX. I was never given a reason why my account was frozen, why my identity was not able to be verified, why my attempts to resolve the identity-issue were disregarded ( spent {$300.00} having everything verified at the US consulate in XXXX ) XXXX why my account was closed and how Goldman Sachs managed to lose all of my savings. Goldman Sachs has been either unwilling or reluctant to resolve the issue despite multiple phone calls between XXXX to XX/XX/2023. In addition, I am puzzled as to why Goldman Sachs provides banking services to customers whose identity has apparently not been fully verified and enables large sum transfers over its systems. 

It is now XXXX XXXX and I still do not have any answers. As per my last call with customer support a week ago Goldman Sachs is searching for my money and promised to have a supervisor reach out. This has not happened yet. After 5 months of desperately trying to receive my funds back I have been mislead and not taken serious by a large bank. As per Goldman Sachs I have no reason to expect the return of my money in the near future which is inflicting significant financial pain on my family. 

All contact with Goldman Sachs happened via phone. I requested the sharing of all our calls in order to have evidence to make my case. Goldman Sachs refused to provide me with transcripts of our phone conversations claiming they were unable to share that information with me as a customer. All calls were held on recorded lines. The only documentation I have are the automated e-mails from Goldman Sachs informing me of the freezing and closure of my accounts. I can provide bank statements from XXXX XXXX that prove that the money was never received after the alleged transfer by Goldman Sachs on XXXX XXXX. I may also be able to provide receipts for the US consulate notarial services and the overnighted documents. Confusingly, I still received automated emails regarding monthly account statements even after the alleged account closure.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","OK","74014","","Consent provided","Web",2023-06-12,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7107317,2023

I thought this was an error because I had been waiting all day during normal delivery hours and I hadnt seen a package at my door or a delivery service vehicle in my driveway. I checked and there was no merchandise at my door or around my front door. The next morning, I checked again and still there was no package at my door or anywhere around my front door. I even checked at the mailbox and asked neighbors. I didnt find the package and my neighbors hadnt received or seen the package. I reached out to XXXX XXXX immediately to inform them that my package was marked as delivered but I didnt get it. I checked the XXXX XXXX app to see the delivery tracking and it was marked as delivered by XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXXXXXX XXXX  This was the first indication that something wasnt right.

Also in the same email, XXXX XXXX stated that theyre not responsible for any delivered packages that XXXX have been stolen or picked up by mistake. I reached out to Goldman Sachs ( Apple Credit Card ), the issuer of my credit card, on XX/XX/XXXX, to initiate a billing error due to XXXX XXXX  statement that they arent responsible for items marked as delivered. In the interim, 72 hours had passed, and I reached out to XXXX XXXX  again to inform them that I hadnt received the items. XXXX XXXX refused to refund the {$89.00} because the delivery service marked it as delivered and there was nothing they could do. The billing error claim was initiated on XX/XX/XXXX. I explained to Goldman Sachs that XXXX XXXX sent me two different delivery dates and times. I hadnt received the package and the package was marked as delivered far outside of normal delivery hours. I also explained that I had asked for delivery confirmation like a picture of the package at my front door to corroborate the delivery. I was issued a temporary credit for {$89.00}. I was informed that the investigation could take up to 90 days. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received notification from Goldman Sachs regarding the outcome of my transaction dispute investigation. The results were unfavorable to me because the evidence submitted by the merchant confirms that the merchandise was delivered, and/or services purchased have been completed. The {$89.00} credit was reversed. I requested copies of the evidence submitted by XXXX XXXX. I received the copy of the evidence on XX/XX/XXXX. The evidence was copies of the three orders that I placed through XXXX XXXX and the details regarding those purchases. One order was from XXXX and was delivered as expected. The second and third orders were the orders I placed in XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX marked the third purchase as returned and refunded which was incorrect. That third order was cancelled because the order was delayed, and the delivery date wouldve been too late for me. I never returned a purchase to XXXX XXXX. And the second order was the only order that I was disputing. I found it strange that XXXX XXXX would submit details about orders that had absolutely nothing to do with the current dispute. And I didnt understand why Goldman Sachs would find that the purchase had been completed simply because the package was marked as delivered by the delivery service company. I immediately reached out to Goldman Sachs to re-initiate the claim because I didnt receive the package. Yes, the item was marked as delivered at two different times, well outside of normal delivery hours, but that didnt mean that it was delivered to the correct address or delivered at all. I re-submitted my billing error dispute again on XX/XX/XXXX. I submitted emails between myself and XXXX XXXX as well the proof that I was given XXXX different delivery dates and times for XXXX package, and both were out of normal delivery hours. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received email notification from Goldman Sachs that the results from the re-submitted billing dispute were ready. And once again, they found that the order had been completed. I have initiated the claim once again. On XX/XX/XXXX, I re-submitted the dispute because I didnt receive the package. The merchant marked the package as delivered but it wasnt received by me. I asked for proof of delivery and the merchant couldnt provide such proof. I reached out to XXXX XXXX the same day the package was marked as delivered to try to come to a resolution. That was all in vain. I reached out to my credit card issuer within the time frame for billing disputes. Im not legally responsible for items that I didnt receive.

Upon reviewing my consumer report, I have identified several discrepancies and errors that have been reported by XXXX XXXX. These inaccuracies have had a significant impact on my creditworthiness and financial reputation. I have attached copies of my consumer report, highlighting the incorrect information, for your reference and review. 

The following issues require your immediate attention and corrective action : XXXX.

This inaccurate account status has negatively affected my credit score and has created unnecessary financial hardship. 

XXXX. Erroneous Late Payments : There are several instances on my consumer report where late payments have been reported for accounts that have been consistently paid on time. These erroneous late payment entries have distorted my credit history and have caused substantial harm to my creditworthiness. 

XXXX. Inaccurate Balance Reporting : The reported balances on my consumer report do not align with the actual balances on my accounts. This discrepancy has led to confusion and misrepresentation of my financial standing, potentially impacting my ability to obtain credit or secure favorable terms. 

I kindly request that you conduct a thorough investigation into these discrepancies and take immediate action to correct the inaccurate information on my consumer report. It is imperative that XXXX XXXX  ensures the accuracy, fairness, and integrity of the information reported to credit reporting agencies. 

I also request that you provide me with written confirmation once the necessary corrections have been made and the accurate information has been reported to the credit reporting agencies. 

I understand that errors can occur, but it is essential that XXXX XXXX  takes prompt and appropriate measures to rectify these inaccuracies. As a responsible customer, I have a legitimate expectation that the information reported on my consumer report is accurate and reflects my true financial standing. 

Please be aware that under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), consumers have the right to dispute incorrect information on their consumer reports. If the necessary corrections are not made within a reasonable timeframe, I may be compelled to exercise my rights under the FCRA to protect the accuracy of my consumer report.

2023-07-16,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem with a purchase shown on your statement","Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement","On XX/XX/2023, I upgraded to the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Order # XXXX ) through the XXXX online store. I was driven to this by the rapidly depleting battery of my previous XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, especially given my ongoing health issues. The new phone was financed via Goldman Sachs Apple Card 0 % APR offer, and after a trade-in value of {$440.00} on my old device, I was left with an installment balance of {$550.00}. 

Around XXXX, my health condition worsened with unpredictable spikes in my XXXX XXXX, often reaching hazardous levels of XXXX. The doctors, however, were unable to diagnose the problem or provide conventional treatment due to my XXXX  condition. This left me reliant on XXXX, while vigilantly monitoring my XXXX XXXX at home. 

Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, the new phone arrived at my doorstep. However, its battery would only charge up to 30 % despite being plugged in overnight. This became critical on XX/XX/XXXX when I was rushed to the hospital due to another XXXX emergency, and my phone battery, despite being charged, dwindled to a mere 19 % after four hours more charging at the hospital. 

Upon my return from the hospital on XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to XXXX 's customer service for assistance. After speaking with three representatives and explaining my predicament - living alone and needing a reliable device for emergencies - I was disappointed to learn they couldn't expedite a replacement. Despite living near an XXXX Store and having received same-day deliveries in the past, they suggested I call the store directly for any possibility of expedited service. 

Following the advice of the customer service, I reached out to the local XXXX Store and spoke with the manager, XXXX. She informed me that I received a 'dead ' phone, i.e., a device with a non-functioning battery. My only option, she said, was to purchase another XXXX XXXX XXXX under the same financing conditions ( through Goldman Sachs Apple Card 's 0 % APR offer, with a trade-in value of {$440.00} and an installment balance of {$550.00} ), with a new order number, XXXX. XXXX assured me that a box would be dispatched to return the defective phone, and that the first phone 's installment loan would be removed from my Apple Card once they received it. However, the replacement couldn't be delivered until XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I dispatched both my old phone and the faulty XXXX XXXX XXXX in separate XXXX XXXX boxes. Unfortunately, XXXX had mistakenly sent me a trade-in box instead of a return box. As a result, both my phones ended up at the trade-in facility. Despite this, my Apple Card still reflected two installment loans for both phones after two weeks. Meanwhile, I started receiving contradictory emails : some confirmed the receipt of both phones at XXXX, while others claimed the received device didn't match the description of my trade-in. 

When I attempted to rectify this confusion with XXXX, she was unreachable. My emails went unanswered, and customer service didn't provide any resolution, even when I called from my hospital bed in early XXXX. In the midst of this chaos, the trade-in department charged my Apple Card {$440.00} to cancel my trade-in. 

Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX, a senior manager at XXXX XXXX, XXXX, managed to piece together the situation. She retrieved the defective phone from the trade-in department, refunded the {$440.00} charge, reversed the additional tax charges, and sent the money to GS Apple Card to clear off the second installment. Attached are the screenshots of these transactions. 

However, the saga didn't end there. On XX/XX/XXXX, the second installment was finally removed from my Apple Card. But just around XX/XX/XXXX, Goldman Sachs Apple Card erroneously reapplied the second installment to my account, resulting in charges for two {$550.00} installments, despite having only one phone. 

Adding to the confusion, Goldman Sachs increased my credit card balance by {$550.00} in addition to reinstating the second installment. I reached out to XXXX XXXX, explaining the latest issue. After reviewing their records, XXXX confirmed that there should only be one installment, provided me with a credit transaction code ( XXXX XXXX ), and instructed me to call GS Apple Card. 

This code, they said, would compel GS to adhere to federal law by removing the second installment, refunding any payments made on it, and refunding the associated taxes. However, despite my efforts to rectify the situation, and after more than five calls to Apple Card, they stubbornly refused to remove the second installment. They argued that since XXXX had already issued a refund, it meant I had lost my case in any dispute over the second installment. It made no sense. They seemed unable to comprehend that charging two installments of {$550.00} for a single phone was a mistake. XXXX XXXX even contacted them while I was on the line to reiterate that they had received the faulty device and had only one installment loan on their records for me. XXXX twice requested Apple Card remove the installment and comply with the transaction code. 

Despite all the efforts to rectify the situation, Apple Card remained unyielding, failing to acknowledge the mistake when Goldman Sachs Apple Card reinstated the second installment on my card. I bought and own one phone. Even XXXX has told Apple Card I only have one installment loan. Why cant they understand that they are charging me for two phones?

I verified this with my bank about 2 weeks ago. The receiving company gets the payments within 2 or 3 days of when the money comes out of my account. 

I have photos of the statements involved. In general, the entire last year. The transaction date on the statements will support my claims. 

Payment due : XXXX of the month Initial Bill Pay send date : XXXX of the month Bill Pay send date over the past year : XXXX of the month Summary : My payments on this account are arriving on time. This is even reflected in the statements. However, the company has been delaying posting for as much as 3 weeks. I pointed this issue out to the CS representative a year ago. This has been happening every other month at this point. 
The only other delay in paying this account was when a 3-month extension was offered due to the COVID outbreak, and that was authorized. 
In fact, I happened to notice this happening last year and I put my payment date back 2 more days. In addition, Greensky and Home Depot are each calling me daily ( I have not answered ) about this account. I have a life and no staff to go back and audit the account, write letters, make or take phone calls where I just end up explaining to morons that the issue is not on my end. The problem is on their end, and I am very busy with my life. The proof is on the account statements. Luckily, I have paper statements on this, but they have it all on computers and it should be easier for them to have noticed and fixed this issue. The problem is that the customer is always blamed. To make things more difficult for me, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Im trying to update this older home while taking care of it. These calls make it more difficult for me to function.
When I did speak to their rep, I was only credited for 1 late fee because that was all that she had the power to do. Waste of my time. Fix it all! 
I pay monthly, automatically, through the bank web bill pay option. On the first payment, I keyed in the number of payments to get to the final one. This means that for nearly 3 years now, the payments have been untouched by me and sent in exactly the same manner other than when I adjusted the payment date last year. I generally dont even open the statements for a couple of months, until I go to file them away. 

Additional information : I purchased an air conditioning system ( including ductwork ) from Home Depot 's vendor at 0 % interest a little over 3 years ago. Additionally, the system has proven to be far below the quality that was described to me by their salesman ( lower-level ductwork and a system that the repairman stated has a part that is known to fail annually, and the concrete pad was cracked on day 1, I did send them that information in my first complaint ). In fact, we had to have a repairman come out to have a known defect ( his admission ) replaced when the system was only 1-1/2-years old. On top of this, they have never closed the permit on the installation. 
I paid extra for this A/C system in the first place for a few of reasons ; American made product, Home Depot vendor , product support ( although it seems more like they take advantage of you ). My son was XXXX when he saw the ductwork they were using, and I dont think the system operates as described either. 
We recently had a different service company ( XXXX ) come out instead of XXXX having had a bad experience with our first XXXX  service call. XXXX offered a lower service fee and didnt even charge us for the visit as opposed to XXXX who charged us for what seems should have been a warranty visit ( we have learned the failing part should have been covered ). XXXX stated that it would be cheaper to have them come out for an annual maintenance call. Our issue would be incorporated in that work, but they also gave us free advice on how to correct the issue we had ( a clogged line ) that had stopped the system from working that day.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","FL","347XX","Older American, Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2023-06-12,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6940441,2023

I was supposed to be issued a refund of {$3500.00} to my XXXX account. I waited until XX/XX/XXXX and since I still hadnt received my refund I opened a dispute with Apple Card Goldman Sachs, they initiated a dispute with XXXX. Then on XX/XX/XXXX I received a credit of {$240.00} which I was confused about because this is not the amount of my dispute which is {$3500.00} When I spoke to a XXXX over the phone they told me that they seen I had been refunded from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$3300.00}. However this is a refund for a returned item that I purchased on XX/XX/XXXX using my actual Apple Card number, not XXXX. I was confused as to why they would think that this had anything to do with my initial dispute of {$3500.00} from a transaction that I made using XXXX. If I make a purchase and received a refund it will be refunded via XXXX. Apple Card Goldman Sachs exclaimed that they made a mistake and put in another dispute to correct the amount owed to me with the subtraction of the {$240.00} that I was credited on XX/XX/XXXX. However most recently on XX/XX/XXXX I was charged {$3300.00} onto my available balance. So I still do not have my refund for this item that I never received and was returned back to XXXX. Once again they have filed another dispute for the amount of {$3300.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I do not believe this issue should take this long. I have provided all necessary XXXX  tracking information as well as all of my transactions to show that I should be refunded, but somehow I keep going in circles over and over again.

This situation not only affected me but also impacted several other passengers. I spoke to 10 other individuals who were suffering from the same last-minute flight changes. Unfortunately, this is not the first time XXXX XXXX has made such changes, and it reflects poorly on their service.

Because I did a wire transfer from the same saving account in Marcus by Goldman Sachs to the same XXXX XXXX checking account on XX/XX/XXXX and the transfer was processed on XX/XX/XXXX, I am expecting this wire transfer should be processed on the same day because the money is wire transferred to the exact same bank and account. But my wire transfer was not processed on XX/XX/XXXX. So, I contacted Marcus in the evening of XX/XX/XXXX and the agent has no idea and submitted an expedited request for me. In the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, a customer representative from Marcus called me and said they need verification of my ownership in another bank to process the transfer and another bank customer service representative is in the conference call already. I answered all the questions from another bank customer service representative in the conference call and they verified my ownership successfully. Then I ask the Marcus representative when my wire transfer will be processed since you already verified, and I need this wire transfer be processed asap. Then she asked me why you are moving this money to XXXX XXXX. This really made me feel not comfortable, but I still told her because XXXX XXXX has better rate and promotion to open an account and that is why I need this wire transfer to be processed asap so that I can meet the promotion deadline. Then she told me she can not tell when, the wire transfer will be approved by another group. 
Again, my wire transfer was still not processed by the end of XX/XX/XXXX. So, this morning on XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Marcus again and the representative told me it is still in process, and they don't know when. 
This is ridicules. I chose wire transfer because I think this is the fastest way to transfer money from XXXX bank to another bank.

2023-08-09,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Credit reporting","Incorrect information on your report","Information belongs to someone else","I have been subjected to unethical practices by GreenSky that have left me deeply concerned about the financial industry 's ability to protect consumers. GreenSky, in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 ( CFPA ), engaged in unfair practices that allowed unauthorized loans to be processed and serviced through their program. These loans were initiated without proper authorization from consumers, leading to unjust financial obligations and a breach of consumer trust. 

Details of My Experience : I began to notice unfamiliar charges on my billing statements and collection letters from GreenSky, accompanied by calls urging me to make payments on loans I had neither requested nor authorized. As someone who had never applied for a loan from GreenSky or even heard of the company prior to these notifications, I was baffled and concerned about the origins of these charges.

After conducting further research, I discovered that GreenSky had engaged in the unethical practice of processing and servicing unauthorized loans, allowing merchants to initiate loans on behalf of consumers without their consent. This practice resulted in at least XXXX complaints from consumers, myself included, who had experienced similar unauthorized loan applications. Investigation into these complaints revealed that the fault primarily lay with the merchants, amounting to at least XXXX instances. 

Impact and Consequences : The actions of GreenSky have had a profound impact on my financial stability and peace of mind. The unauthorized loans have created financial burdens that were never part of my financial planning, leading to unnecessary stress and anxiety. Additionally, the lack of proper merchant training and oversight, as well as the company 's failure to manage consumer complaints adequately, demonstrates a significant oversight on the part of GreenSky.

Expected Resolution : Given the extent of harm inflicted on myself and other consumers, I implore the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to take swift and decisive action against GreenSky. I expect GreenSky to refund or cancel the unauthorized loan, as mandated by the consent order as a consequence of their unethical behavior. It is essential that GreenSky also implement robust procedures to prevent the recurrence of such fraudulent loans in the future.

Conclusion : I trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will take my complaint seriously and undertake appropriate measures to ensure that GreenSky is held accountable for its actions. The wellbeing of consumers is paramount, and it is imperative that actions are taken to rectify the financial and emotional damages caused by the company 's irresponsible and unfair practices.

At the time of the refund, I had a {$4000.00} balance on my credit card from previous purchases. {$4000.00} of the refund was applied to my credit card balance. ( I am ok with this ) Separately, I also had two installment purchases from Apple, also through Goldman Sachs. Both installment sales were 12 month 0 % interest. The first installment sale was from XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) and had a balance of {$420.00} remaining. The second was from a XX/XX/XXXX for a XXXX XXXX and had a balance of {$3200.00} remaining. 

I spoke with Goldman Sachs on XX/XX/XXXX and requested a full refund and cash return for the {$10000.00}. I was originally told I would receive it. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I only received {$1700.00} credit reversal to may account. {$4000.00} was applied to my credit card ( I am not disputing this ) The remainder refund balance has been put on hold and will not be returned to me. I have spoke to Goldman Sachs on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

I have been told that because I have two installment balances, the excess from my XXXX XXXX University refund will be held for the remainder of the life of the installment sales and will be applied against my installment balances monthly. I have been told that this is in the credit card agreement. 

regardless if this is in the agreement, this is an unfair business practice! My refund from XXXX University was absolutely unrelated to the installment sales of the both apple products. As well, I used my card to pay XXXX XXXX University. And then promptly paid off the balance on my card from that transaction. 

I was told 5 times by the Goldman Sachs reps, Supervisors and Manager that they have had several complaints about this practice. 

I am seeking a refund of {$3700.00} from Goldman, which represents my remainder balance from Goldman Sachs {$10000.00} refund and equals the balance of the XXXX and XXXX XXXX installment balances.

This works for all but my GM Rewards Card by Marcus Goldan Sachs. For that card I have my bank send them a check XXXX day earlier, so XX/XX/XXXX when the payment is due by XX/XX/XXXX. That is because the GM credit card will issue a late fee/interest fee if the payment is received on the day it was due. The late fee/interest fee are then reversed automatically. But Ive had to also call to make sure it was reversed. So a waste of my time. Why are they this? I believe they are pressuring consumers to send their payment in a day or two earlier, thus having MILLONS or maybe BILLIONS of dollars on hand one or two days earlier, which is a HUGE bonus for them. 

My most recent payment was due XX/XX/XXXX, so I had my bank send them a check on XX/XX/XXXX. Yet I received a letter saying I missed a payment. So I called and sure enough the payment was recevied XX/XX/XXXX and the fees were automatically reversed. So now even one day early is not enough?

2023-07-01,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Managing an account","Problem accessing account","For 3 months and counting, Goldman Sachs ( GS ) has denied me, an XXXXXXXX XXXX living on a fixed income, access to my Marcus Online Savings Account ( OSA ). This is my second CFPB complaint regarding this issue. 

Each time I contact GS they tell me there's something else I need to do to resolve this issue, an issue which GS has never explained to me. Here 's a summary of the rabbit holes GS has sent me down over the past 3 months : XXXX XXXX XXXX GS told me that if I confirm my personal identity information ( PII ) with their identity verification team, they would unlock my OSA. After providing my PII, my OSA remained locked. 

XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX GS told me that if I get on a conference call with GS and XXXX XXXX, they would transfer my OSA balance to XXXX XXXX. After completing the call, GS unlocked my OSA, initiated the transfer to XXXX XXXX, relocked my OSA and recalled/reversed the transfer. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX  GS told me that if I submit an Affidavit of Identity ( AOI ) they would unlock my OSA. After receiving the AOI, GS unlocked my account only to relock it XXXX minutes later. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX GS told me that if I have the banks that funded my OSA recall/reverse the ACH the funding transfers that I would get my OSA money back, minus the OSA earned interest. I met with my XXXX XXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXX managers who told me it was impossible for them to recall/reverse an ACH that was initiated by GS. 

Question 1 : Why was my OSA locked upon transferring money to an external bank account that I had successfully transferred OSA funds to? 

Question 2 : Why hasn't GS mailed a check for my OSA account balance to the address associated to my OSA and verified in the GS requested AOI? 

The following details what's happened since submitting my first CFPB complaint ( Complaint ID XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX along with some associated questions for GS. 

In GS 's response to my XX/XX/XXXX complaint, GS stated that they were waiting for me to submit an Affidavit of Identity ( AOI ). I mailed the AOI to GS on XXXX using next-day shipping. After hearing nothing from GS for over two weeks and still not having access to my OSA, I called them on XX/XX/XXXX for a status. GS told me they'd received my AOI, that it looked good, and that they would unlock my OSA while I was on the call which they did- I verified it was unlocked using the OSA app. I immediately requested GS to close my OSA and mail me a check for the account balance but was told by GS XXXX XXXX that the account had been relocked, was under investigation and that I would get an email explaining the results of the investigation in 1-3 days. 

Question 3 : Why was my account unlocked on XX/XX/XXXX then relocked on XX/XX/XXXX after GS received the AOI they requested? 

After waiting a week without receiving an investigation results email and still not having access to my OSA, I called GS on XX/XX/XXXX and was told the investigation hadn't started. I immediately asked to talk to a GS supervisor but was told I had to submit a request to do so. I submitted a request and was told I would get a call from a supervisor on XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. My son, who has my Power of Attorney, received a call from a supervisor on XX/XX/XXXX. However, I was unavailable to talk at that time and the supervisor refused to reschedule the call ( e.g., call later in the day ) per my son 's request. 

Question 4 : Why did I never receive an investigation results email from GS in 1-3 days as promised? 

Question 5 : Why to this day have I never received an investigation results email from GS? 

After hearing nothing from GS and still not having access to my OSA, I called GS on 6/2 for a status and was told by GS XXXX XXXX that my OSA had been CLOSED and that I would get an OSA closure letter in the mail in XXXX business days documenting the following : * Date OSA was closed * Reason OSA was closed * Current OSA balance * How to get my money, including interest, out of the closed OSA XXXX did tell me that I would need to have the banks that funded my OSA recall/reverse the ACH fund transfers. Shortly after this call, I received an email from GS stating that my account was closed. However, the email did not contain any of the bulleted information bulleted above. 

After waiting almost three weeks and not receiving an OSA closure letter, I received a copy of my XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX OSA statements in the mail and a letter stating that the account was open! However, when I tried to access the account using the OSA app, I got the familiar """" OSA Temporarily Locked '' message. 

Question 6 : Why did I never receive an account closure letter from GS in 7-10 business days as promised? 

Question 7 : Why to this day have I never received an account closure letter from GS? 

Question 8 : What is the status of my OSA? XXXX XXXX stated on XXXX that it was closed, the GS email I received on XXXX stated that it was closed, the GS letter I received on XX/XX/XXXX with the XXXX, XXXX and XXXX OSA statements stated that my OSA was open and the OSA app states today that it is temporarily locked. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I went to the XXXX banks ( XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  ) that funded my OSA and asked them to recall/reverse their respective ACH fund transfers as instructed by GS. Both the XXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXX mangers told me it's impossible for them to do that since GS, not their banks, initiated these ACH fund transfers. They said that GS has to mail me a check for my OSA balance. 

Question 9 : Why did GS instruct me to have my banks do something that's impossible? 

A few weeks ago, a representative from Virginia 's Fairfax County Department of Family Services Office came to my house regarding my son helping me get access to my OSA. As my son and I have mentioned to GS, he has my financial Power of Attorney. On top of that, my son has never talked to any GS representative regarding my account without me first explicitly telling the GS representative that he has my permission to do so. GS contacting this organization is harassment. I should be the one contacting this organization to file a complaint regarding GS denying me access to my OSA for over 3 months. 

Question 10 : On what grounds did GS contact the Fairfax County Office of Adult Protective Services? 

If I don't get meaningful and accurate answers to these questions and a check for the balance of my OSA, CFPB has advised me to contact the Virginia State Banking Regulator and Virginia Attorney General regarding my CFPB complaints.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","VA","22182","Older American","Consent provided","Web",2023-07-01,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7186627,2023

'' Additionally, """" I'm not given information as to why it happened, I do know that the turn around time is based on a case by case basis. '' Days later I was able to have Goldman Sachs unlocked the credit card by answering some simple questions, and was told that there a declined charge and they attempted to contact me even though I verified the charge was correct when notified via the Apple XXXX messaging. I was able now to use the card and since I was told by the savings account XXXX that they could not unlock the savings account until the review by the credit card product was completed, I asked to speak to them to proceed with the unlock. I was notified by the savings account XXXX that there was indeed still a review on my credit card product irrespective of the ability to now use the card without any lock. They informed me that they were not able to unlock the savings account due to that department 's continual review. 

From the aforementioned complained I filed on XX/XX/2023, today is XX/XX/2023 - XXXX business days later and no communication from Goldman Sachs regarding this matter. I was advised today to file another complaint to the same department which failed to return communication within their promised XXXX business days. I was told by a supervisor in the fraud department for the credit card product that that is the best which they can do to contact any superiors for escalation. 

Since XX/XX/2023 I am still unable to access funds in my savings account now for over 16 days - and with no recourse to rectify the situation. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I was not concerned as I had XXXX savings accounts with Goldman Sachs and had dealt with them previously. 
Through my bill pay i made the following payments, and Goldman Sachs accepted them, XX/XX/XXXX - {$20.00} ; XXXX XXXX - {$100.00} ; XXXX XXXX - {$25.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$25.00} XXXX XXXX {$25.00}, XXXX XXXX {$100.00}, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX {$25.00} XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX {$250.00}, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX - {$25.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$25.00}, XX/XX/XXXX, {$25.00} XXXX XXXX {$25.00} Additionally these payments were made by XXXX XXXXXXXX {$29.00} The payments not accounted for in XXXX were more extensive. 
An example of the issues are on the statement from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX The following payments were finally credited- XXXX {$50.00}, XXXX {$40.00} ; XX/XX/XXXX {$40.00} ; XX/XX/XXXX - {$20.00} ; XXXX XXXX - {$100.00} ; XXXX XXXX - {$25.00} These payments had sat with Goldman Sachs for months , and while they had refunded the late fees, they stated it would not happen again, The following month it happened again. 
A couple of days ago, i got another phone call, my payment was late again, only the previous month i had set up autopay from my Goldman Sachs account again. Only this time i was told they had fixed the issue, because I couldn't have XXXX accounts attached for bill pay. 
I was notified i was not making payments but in reality they did not put the funds on my account. They then charged me late fees, and stopped my card from being used. They notified the credit bureaus I am consistently late and it has adversely affected my credit score. I have spent hours on the phone with the representatives, """" managers '', leads all without resolution. 
Yesterday, a manger XXXX, notified me that the autopay i had set up was removed as the bank account did not exist. The account is a savings account with Goldman Sachs, and they were able to verify it existed when it was set up. She then told me they only pull from checking accounts and this was a XXXX account. I noted they had pulled a XXXX time payment from my XXXX  account with a different financial institution in the past without issue. She then said i must have had a XXXX account attached to the account. When i pointed out it did not, she got snarky and informed me I was wrong. I could only make a one time payment from savings attached to checking. 
I have spent hours and hours on the phone, and no resolution has been offered. Instead i get told i am wrong, and the fees roll in and my credit takes a hit. 
When I call I get told there are a couple notes, nothing showing all i have had to tolerate in the last XXXX  mnths","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","OR","97123","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2023-06-30,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7189256,2023

I originally had a card with them, that has been closed for over a year now. My bankruptcy discharged my debt with them, and the subsequently, the account was closed. After trying on three separate ocassions to rebuild my credit and apply for a new card, they refuse to accept or provide a decision on the application because I have an existing/open account with them. This is extremely predatory and violates discrimination laws. They purposely wont accept my application because my debt was discharged with them, and they are annoyed that they can not harass me about it anymore. I have been working very hard to be responsible with my spending, and attempt to fix my credit. No matter what I do, how long I wait, or who I talk to, Apple/Goldman Sachs says there is nothing they can do, despite Apple employees named XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX who insisted that they would fix the problem, but they havent. This is a never-ending problem that can simply be fixed, which would be to allow my applications for credit to be processed normally ( like everyone else ) but they refuse to let me sign up for another account ever again. Barring me from the application process based on my financial status is a violation of federal law, and I will take immediate legal action, should this not be addressed and solved.

I got an Apple Card as a back up. I maybe had XXXX dollars total charges on it the year and a half I had it before I stopped making payments from the ridiculous lack of any fraud protection and continuous fraudulent charges. For two years, I tried to get this resolved. I would always have to start over at stage one as Goldman Sachs would either not keep records, or when the person who could finally help me was to call me, they literally would not every single time, and Id finally get a call from someone who had apparently no idea of the 11-12 previous times at the end I had proven these charges fraudulent and awaited resolution. ONE TIME, they finally reversed all those charges. I happily paid. BUT THEN, despite these fraudulent charges coming from websites or states I had never visited, for example Goldman Sachs claimed my physical card was used in Texas while I was in Florida, and I would give them all the evidence, and eventually after the two hour grueling irritating runaround that they had set up as on the internet you can see this was clearly a business practice of theirs, theyd tell me theyd be able to help, and then either never return a call, have someone call without any idea of the past discussion and start over, or try to claim the charges were valid. As a soon to be lawyer at the time, in XXXX, I finally sent them the federal statute saying no one can be liable for more than {$50.00} in fraudulent charges. Told them I would report them. Then sue. Then I passed the bar and life got crazy. However, it just turned up again, as they know I dont owe the money hence why no collection is present, as when they tried to I put my foot down and explained how many fines and damages theyd be looking at if the forced me to sue, and that the tens of thousands of dollars theyd have to pay to defend compared to the hours of my life and court filing fees as they clearly were engaging in unlawful and deceptive business practices to avoid taking accountability that DESPITE REQUESTING THEY CHANGE MY CARD # THREE TIMES, THE REASON THE FRAUD PERSISTED WAS THEYD ONLY CHANGE THE PHYSICAL CARD #, AND I TOLD THEM EACH TIME CHANGE BOTH BUT THE DIGITAL NUMBER WAS COMPROMISED AND THEY EVEN PERMITTED FRAUDULENT CHARGES FROM VENDORS I HAD ALREADY SOMETIMES THREE TIMES PRIOR ALERTED THEM TO. Now, they have a status on my card as revoked. It doesnt look good to the bar, worst of all, it was not revoked. I paid as long as I could but finally when two years went by and I was paying off fraudulent charges and interest, I just couldnt and shouldnt and legally am not obligated to. They breached the contract, failed to provide fraud protection, failed to make proper good faith investigation into such, failed to provide any proof to their findings for either claiming the charges were valid, or when one time I finally thought I had at long last gotten justice, all charges were reversed, until two weeks later, somehow they magically became valid and were put back on. I am having my financial reputation, and my financial and credit score-based interests harmed by this practice that a simple XXXX search will show they have been deliberately doing and already sued over many times since before I even got my card. I kept telling them I want to pay what I owe but why would I pay statements that were, at the end 95-100 % principle and interest of fraud. I frankly wish to have an Apple Card again so I dont mind compromising but a compromise after all they put me through is paying the I believe {$500.00} left that are valid charges. Telling and demonstrative of their blatantly illegal and unlawful business practices is that magically a year ago they claimed I owed {$5700.00}, yet rather than increase it as would a legit debt, right now they say I owe {$3000.00} roughly, because just like the collection, they seem to be quite aware that they cant get away with everything but clearly are trying to manipulate and frustrate attempts to gain proper resolution in order to save a few dollars themselves despite contractually being obligated to have protected my information and indemnified or covered me for fraud charges, especially when three times I ask them to change the number and the say yes but dont change the compromised digital number. Anyway, the collection being dropped, the balance dropping, THE FACT THAT EVERY TIME I AM SUPPOSED TO FINALLY GET A CALL FROM SOMEONE WHO EVEN HAS THE AUTHORITY TO REMOVE THE CHARGES, as it takes three phone calls and the runaround to get even an appointment with them in disputing which is absurd, they NEVER CALL. And whenever I get a call, despite all calls being recorded and documented they claim, for some reason its another basic level customer representative without any idea of my situation that there must be 50-100 hours of recorded phone calls on and more notes. Eventually I had to give up trying it was wasting too much time, and am just reporting it now as frankly Ive been so busy it didnt come up till I was asked about a revoked credit card. That also is a violation of the Fair credit reporting act and fair financial reporting statutes. They are doing this to so many people I can not believe how many have had my experience, reading articles and peoples posts about it and XXXX  complaints, being successfully sued as I am about to possibly engage in again so many times and not even trying to defend it but settling for everything plaintiffs are asking for yet somehow someway the CFPB to my knowledge has not done anything. They need to be reminded of all the federal statutory considerations mentioned above and theyre need to adhere to their contractual obligations. It simply violates numerous consumer protection and fair credit reporting laws every day they continue to claim my card is revoked and I owe any more than {$500.00}, which frankly is more than I owe, but I simply want to get this nonsense over with and calling them is literally futile theyve designed their corporate runaround to ensure that. Please help me finally get this resolved because XXXX cant believe how many times I was supposed to get a call back from them to finalize it and did not. It is disgusting.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","ME","040XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-04-30,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",6908910,2023

I called them on their phone number ( XXXX ) and answered all security questions successfully. They said that they need a phone number to provide a security code and I gave them the phone number on file which I was also using to call them. They said they were unable to send it to that phone number and would not give a reason. Despite this, the app sends a OTP pin to my phone number no problem and lets me sign in with it. Anyways, they said the only thing that would let them disclose why they had told me to call them was an notarized affidavit of identity sent to me by mail. Fast forward 5 days and I still have not received the letter, so I call them again. They said it takes up to 10 days and to call them back. I asked if there was an online form I could print out instead of being sent it and they said no, despite one being available on XXXX when you search """" Marcus Affidavit of Identity Form '' on their website, marcus.com. Now, 10 days after the initial phone call I am given the same routine on the phone. They tried to put in a new request for the form, but I informed them that I had called 10 days ago and the request for the form was already put in. They found the request and said it was still processing. I was told that they were escalating the issue and I should hear back from them. I have missed rent and credit card payments as a result of not being able to withdraw my own FDIC insured funds from the bank. They even accepted the direct deposit to the account from my work and won't let me access it.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","WA","981XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-10-07,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7655361,2023

Well some of these disputes have been re-disputed 4 or 5 times. 3 ) This mess has been going on since XX/XX/XXXX which all the disputes were disputed in XXXX of XXXX. There were 8 disputed on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX disputed on XX/XX/XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX there were 44 transactions disputed. That is a total of 75 disputes and that is all I have disputed. So where they are getting all their numbers is beyond me. I have receipts for them all and have had 75 ruled in my favor and have proof of that, so dont know where these 5 disputes remaining came from, because I have not disputed any since XX/XX/XXXX, 4 ) As far as I am concerned this ACCOUNT IS TOTALLY CLOSED. 5 ) Are they adding disputes to get more money from me? They still owe me for the 13 disputes for {$1000.00} that they never credited my account. 6 ) On XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone call from Goldman Sachs regarding needing evidence for the remaining disputes. I told them they had to send me an email so I could send the evidence but after waiting all day I never received it, so I notified them per chat and was able to send the evidence through chat. The next morning I received an email from them ruling the disputes not in my favor so I re-disputed them. There is no way they had time to investigate the evidence, They were harassing me. 6 ) Today XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from them requesting more evidence for the re-disputed transactions and I resent all he evidence which is the same as I sent for the last 75 that have been ruled in my favor. I dont know why I have to keep sending the same evidence if they already have it. 7 ) This is total fraud and they have stated the merchant had contact with me and I authorized these transactions and that is a complete lie, I did not authorize any of the disputes that I have disputed. I have the merchants evidence and Goldman Sachs authorized all the disputed transactions by a name and address. There is no evidence of a charge card number, CVV number, password, or PIN number. I dont use Face ID or fingerprint ID and the IP address belongs to someone in XXXX XXXX over 400 miles away from where I live, I have proof of that. So it was not my device that was making the transactions so you need to do more investigating which you seem not know how to do. I had to investigate myself from the merchants evidence.

Since XX/XX/2022 I have been trying to have them replace my ITIN number with my Social Security number on my account. Despite multiple attempts on my part to resolve this matter, my request remains unattended. 

The first time I called Goldman Sachs to request the change, they assured me that the change would be reflected in 10 days. Two months passed and no change was made. I then called back and was connected with a supervisor who escalated the situation and promised that the change would be made in 10 days. 

Since then, I have called two more times and have spoken with supervisors, each of whom assured me that the situation was being escalated and that I would be contacted in 10 days. However, despite these repeated promises, no change has been made and I have received no communication. 

These ongoing delays and the lack of resolution are not only frustrating, but are also negatively affecting my credit score. Each time I speak with a new supervisor, there seems to be a new reason why the change has not yet been made - that the previous supervisor made a mistake, that a ticket was not created, that my contact information was not entered correctly. 

As a customer, I am not getting the attention to this matter. I feel that Goldman Sachs is not acting and prolonging the situation, each time telling me that I will have a response in 10 days and then doing nothing to resolve the problem. 

Therefore, I am submitting this formal complaint in the hope that you can help me resolve this matter.

The credits of the payment was supposed to be processed, and the book entry was supposed to show that nothing was owed. I called USPS to confirm that the Registered Security was delivered. They stated that it was delivered to a Mailing Agent for final delivery at Goldman Sachs. I called the Principal Office at the phone number listed on the SEC Indenture Agreement filings to confirm receipt of the Registered Security, and was transferred to the mail room and told by the mail room attendant to send an email to an internal email address in order to confirm receipt of the Registered Security. Upon sending the email, I received two MailerDaemon notices stating that my email was blocked and that email did not receive external emails. I called Office of Goldman Sachs again and asked for the corporate secretary. The representative asked who the mail was attention to and I advised it was the CFO ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), the rep stated that they would take my name and number and advise XXXX XXXX 's office of the message.

That was when I turned to my credit card company in hopes for them to represent me and get my money back. On XX/XX/XXXX I was issued a temporary provisional credit of {$110.00} from Goldman Sachs Apple Card. 
On XX/XX/XXXX they notified me that they were unable to resolve it with the company, XXXX, and that it was ruled in the favor of the merchant.

After a month or so I checked back in with them and spoke with a supervisor providing all the info/evidence both verbally and via e-mail that I had. They reassured me saying that if I don't hear back from them by XX/XX/XXXX that it most likely was ruled in my favor. 

But on XX/XX/XXXX I received an email AGAIN saying that with further investigation it resulted in the favor of the merchant. I was then charged the {$110.00}.

I've given permission to my child in the past to use the apple XXXX but not by this much after scolding him for such reckless degenerate behaviour I became immensely worried as this was simply too much money wasted way too quickly. 

I thought to myself why does APPLE not flag these purchases at all and deny them? 
I'm not wealthy by any means and so having that much money disappear from my bank account that fast is just something that has caused me immense financial difficulty. 

I had looked up ways to recover my funds i thought at first of going to my bank but realized that apple must have some way for customers to be refunded for virtual content purchases. I've heard horror stories before from games like fortnite where kids would spend thousands of dollars and place their parents in debt with charges that'd never be refunded from lootboxes and other virtual content so I was worried this would be a similar situation. 

I contacted apple support under 1 and 2 hours immediately after these purchases for a refund. 
exact date and time I had contacted them was Mon, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX so I was within a reasonable timeframe for a refund. 
as the purchases were made XX/XX/2023, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX It should've been rather simple for apple to rollback any purchases made instead I had several days of my time wasted by their support in which time I've been in the red on my bank account. 
the fact that their support takes an insanely long time to resolve trivial issues like this says something alot about them and their total disregard for the customer. 

This mind you was the first time in my entire life I've ever been through their refund process. Perhaps they discriminated me because of my foreign sounding name? Or simply just didn't care enough whatever may be the case I'm extremely angry at how they've handled my case. 
Apple in app purchases shouldn't EVER have a refund denied if its done in a timely manner especially for someone first time especially in the case of lootbox/virtual content that has no tangible nor material presence. 
i've literally lost money because of pixels on a screen and apple simply can not just rollback all of the content?

I spoke with XXXX. He informed me that he could see the credit balance on my account. I inquired as to how I could get my money back. He informed me that he would process the balance refund request. He stated that since the payment was made by paper check, I had to receive the refund by paper check ( I could not receive it electronically ). I found this odd as my credit union has an """" established relationship '' with Marcus, but I accepted it. XXXX  stated that he typed in the urgency of my request as I needed the money back to make payments to XXXX XXXX as we always pay our bills in full. He stated it would take 10-12 business days to receive the refund. 

On the XXXX business day, XX/XX/XXXX, I had not received the refunded money. I contacted Marcus GM Card by Goldman Sachs again. I spoke with XXXX - I somehow ended up in the financial institution help line. He first insisted he had to offer me a sales pitch. After giving him all of my information, he said he couldn't help me, but would connect me with someone else. I hung up and called again to get to the credit card division. I spoke with XXXX. He said I could link my bank account with Marcus and then the refund would be faster than paper, but it would still take an additional XXXX to XXXX business days. I asked to speak to his supervisor. I then spoke with XXXX. I explained that the first mistake was mine, but this was now Marcus 's mistake because allegedly XXXX did not process it correctly. I explained that I needed this money to make payment to XXXX XXXX. He said there was nothing he could do except process a digital request that would still take 8-10 business days. It is now XX/XX/XXXX ; they now have been holding my money for 30 days. The first mistake was mine, but I did what was needed to correct it. I told them that it was unacceptable that it would take 8-10 additional business days to process the request again. He told me that there was nothing else that could be done. I explained that I had no guarantee that he would process the request as XXXX assured me it was processed and it wasn't. 

I informed XXXX that I would be filing a complaint with CFPB for documentation and that as soon as the money was returned, I would be closing this card. I have spent approximately three hours of my time trying to resolve this issue.

2. Total balance in account was approximately {$5600.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX. 

3. Attempted to make a withdrawal on the Marcus by Goldman Sachs website in the amount of {$5600.00} via ACH to my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 

4. Marcus by Goldman Sachs NEVER transmitted the ACH per my instruction in the amount of {$5600.00} as a result I did not receive MY funds the following day. Repeated calls to customer service stated that the ACH transfer was sent and to check with the receiving Credit Union. Customer service/their Supervisor had the intellect of a teenager and could not answer basic questions like the exact timestamp of the ACH. Customer service would not provide a 15 digit ACH trace number either. Attempts to speak with a higher level representative at Goldman Sachs Bank have been unsuccessful. The bank simply does not care and will not escalate concerns to higher levels of management. I was hung up on, screamed at several times by Goldman Sachs Bank customer service representatives. Marcus ' website advertises SAME DAY TRANSFERS of less than {$100000.00}.

5. Next business day on XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone call from XXXX in the Back Office ( XXXX UT ) in an attempt to confirm I performed the subject transfer via their website. Because the funds originated from different financial institutions to Marcus, she reversed ( money not back in my Marcus account until XX/XX/XXXX ) my transfer and told me it could not be completed UNLESS I transferred the original amounts back to their originating financial institution. She wanted to verify these were MY funds. Funny, Marcus had no problem accepting my funds for weeks but when it comes time to withdraw said funds, they provide all kinds of roadblocks trying to do so. XXXX said that my funds would be reversed and I need to re-initiate ACH transfers of exact amounts given to the originating financial institutions in order to get my money out of Marcus. I questioned the accountability of her statements and she hung up on me. This is because several customer service representative previously stated my funds had already left Goldman Sachs Bank via ACH in route to my financial institution as requested. No one knew the transfer was """" stopped '' by the back office. 

6. Furious, I contact Goldman Sachs Corporate Offices in XXXX XXXX. They assure me someone will contact me that can help. No one from Corporate or HIGHER level Management has contacted me to date. I have been in communication with a XXXX XXXX in Texas who is a Call Center Manager, but she does not even have the abilities to confirm/ensure ACH transfers leave Goldman Sachs Bank per her own words.

7. XX/XX/XXXX I re-initiate the ACH transfers as instructed by the representative in Marcus ' Back Office. My funds still have not been sent out via ACH.

Marcus by Goldman Sachs has stolen {$5600.00} of my funds and I do not have a pathway of getting the funds back. THIS IS THEFT. There are reports and complaints about this very problem already at the CFPB and on XXXX.

Rather than asking for Apple Card/Goldman Sachs to resolve the dispute in my favor like I did in my original complaint, I would like to complain about the fact that these disputes have been resolved in the merchants favor despite the merchant not actually existing. Apple Card/Goldman Sachs said in their reply to my first complaint that they dont have any merchant evidence because they looked only at my account, not involving the merchant. If they had looked into the merchant, they would see that the merchant doesnt even exist. I was given this information from the credit card company : The merchant is XXXX XXXX, their address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX, and the category of the transaction is clothing. 

There is no clothing store at that address, nor is there any company called XXXX XXXX. There is no information to be found online about XXXX XXXX, nor any contact information. According to the Texas Comptroller website, there is no business license in the state of Texas for a company called XXXX XXXX. It does not exist. It is not possible for me to have made a purchase from a merchant that does not exist. 

I am now submitting this complaint because the credit card company did not do this due diligence, and instead focused only on my account. I could not have made the purchase, because there is no merchant for me to have purchased from. 

For additional information, I did make a purchase last year from a company called XXXX XXXX for a similar monetary amount and received those funds back after the company was found to be fraudulent and ended up closing before opening under a new business name ( XXXX ).

My contention primarily revolves around XXXX distinct charges, namely {$970.00} ( Reference XXXX ), {$1800.00} ( Reference XXXX ), and {$1200.00} ( Reference XXXX ). The items associated with these charges were returned in a singular package, as per the instructions provided by XXXX 's, who furnished me with a single return label. 

The purported evidence provided by XXXX 's is, upon closer inspection, insufficient to substantiate their allegations. It merely confirms the receipt of goods, a fact I have never disputed. My contestation lies in the subsequent return of these goods through XXXX, utilizing XXXX 's provided shipping label. 

The allegations of being an """" abuser '' are not only grossly inaccurate but also wholly unsupported by any tangible evidence or precedent. A cursory review of XXXX 's internal records would substantiate my claim that this was my maiden online purchase through their platform. The absence of any historical orders or returns under my name and billing address should further corroborate my assertions. 

The narrative of events could not be simpler : I received items that were unsuitable for myself and my partner, requested a return, and dutifully sent the items back using the provided XXXX shipping label. Regrettably, the package was reported as lost in transit. Despite multiple assurances of a forthcoming refund from XXXX 's representatives, the repayment remains outstanding, a source of great frustration. 

The role of Apple Card in this matter has, unfortunately, left much to be desired. The institution 's apparent endorsement of XXXX 's unsupported assertions has been disappointing. 

In essence, I find myself in an undesirable situation where I am without the items I initially purchased, saddled with the associated debt, and deprived of a much-needed refund. It is my sincere hope that this explanation provides clarity and prompts a re-evaluation of my case. 

In light of these experiences, I have resolved to discontinue any future transactions with XXXX 's. I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your assistance in resolving this.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NY","10459","","Consent provided","Web",2023-08-14,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7395341,2023

Their approach towards dispute resolution demonstrates a blatant disregard for the gravity of the situation and reflects an alarming lack of professionalism. The subpar service provided not only raises questions about their commitment to customer satisfaction, but also severely undermines the trust that consumers place in such an esteemed financial institution.

1. Dispute Case Number : XXXX ; {$14.00}. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I was extremely dismayed to receive the case result from Goldman Sachs, the issuer of Apple Card, which indicated a credit of {$2.00} and a subsequent rebilling of {$11.00}. According to Goldman Sachs, I had already received a credit from the merchant for the disputed amount, which I firmly believe should have been {$11.00}. However, upon closely examining my transaction history, I discovered that the only {$11.00} credit I received was dated XX/XX/XXXX. Furthermore, the merchant 's website clearly states that this amount corresponds to an entirely different order. 

2. Dispute Case Number : XXXX & XXXX ; {$350.00}. 
After receiving the result of my initial dispute, I found significant inaccuracies in the evidence provided by the merchant, prompting me to file an appeal on XX/XX/XXXX. In my appeal, I highlighted four issues and submitted three supporting documents to bolster my case. My dispute was not about a cancellation but rather a hygiene issue with a hospitality service. Additionally, I pointed out the misleading 12-hour request that the merchant 's evidence couldn't even support, and the fact that the document provided by the merchant wasn't accessible to customers at the time of booking. 
However, upon receiving information on how Goldman Sachs made their appeal decision, I was dismayed to find that the documents and information used were identical to those in the first dispute. This raises serious concerns about whether my appeal was even duly considered. Furthermore, when I attempted to request information about the appeal decision through chat customer service on XX/XX/XXXX, I encountered strong resistance from the representative, who even stated, """" there is no need to do that, the decision has been made. '' This entire experience has left me extremely dissatisfied with the dispute resolution process of Goldman Sachs. I am disappointed by the lack of transparency, unresponsiveness, and apparent disregard for the additional evidence provided in my appeal. I urgently request that my case be re-examined by a different team or supervisor to ensure a fair and thorough assessment of the matter. Additionally, I would like to receive a clear explanation of the decision-making process and the factors considered in reaching the final determination.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","WA","98029","","Consent provided","Web",2023-04-16,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",6843880,2023

2023-11-06,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","Mobile or digital wallet","Unauthorized transactions or other transaction problem","","On XXXX, my Apple ID was hacked and taken over. That evening I received a call from XXXX, the Apple Card Goldman Sachs number. I had two recent fraudulent transactions : {$9600.00} on XXXX and {$3600.00} on XXXX both attempted at XXXX XXXX somewhere in Florida. The caller claimed to be a representative from Apple Card services. The caller told me that they could see that I had fraudulent activity on my account. The caller knew the specific amounts of the two fraudulent transactions and where they were from, as well as my last legitimate transaction {$32.00} at XXXX. The caller also knew my address and asked me to confirm it. The caller said he needed to send me a message to my Apple ID with a code to verify my identity so that he could secure my account. 

That is where everything went wrong. 

As soon as I gave the representative the code, I got an alert saying that my password had been changed. I began trying to change the password backand was not as fast as the hacker. 

That code is what gave the hacker access to my apple account -- which allowed him to change the trusted phone number, password, and ultimately the email/Apple ID on the account. Once he took over my account, he then had access to my apple wallet which not only had my Apple Credit Card, but also my XXXX XXXX, and my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Within moments, he had transferred {$500.00}, {$500.00}, {$500.00} out of my account checking account through Apple Cash.

In the same moment of the first Apple Cash transfer and realizing he was actually a hacker/scammer, I also received a text from my bank asking if the {$500.00} was a fraudulent transaction. The text message allowed me to report the transaction as a fraudulent charge and request a call from the fraud department. Within moments, I spoke with the fraud department and canceled my card. However, the hacker had already succeeded in completing the three charges before I was able to cut off my card. My bank began a fraud investigation with Apple Cash at this time. 

Next, I opened my XXXX mobile app to lock my card and request a new number. Thankfully, the hacker had not made any charges on my XXXX card. 

After that call, I contacted Apple Card Services to place a hold on my account so that the card could not be used while I attempted to sort out the Apple ID credentials and hopefully regain access to my account. It took a few hours to speak to a person from Apple Card Services, so some charges were made during that timebut Apple Card was able to deny them without problem. Once I spoke to someone, a hold was placed on my account and I was told to call back once I got everything sorted out to regain access to my card.

That evening, I began my first of many conversations with Apple Support trying to recover my account. Each conversation with Apple has been extremely difficult simply because my apple identity no longer is supported by Appleessentially when the hacker took over my account, he erased my identity. ( While there is encrypted data that will always live on in the Apple world with my previous Apple ID, my old Apple ID is no longer supported, and therefore it appears as if it doesnt exist ). Working with the specialist, I submitted tickets to Apple technical support to help with account recovery or activation lock. Unfortunately, I was unsuccessful in gaining access to my original Apple ID, and it was apparent that I was going to have to create a new Apple Identity and then get past the activation lock. Throughout this entire process, each time I spoke with a specialist, they told me they were leaving detailed notes on my account. Each time I spoke with anyone from Apple Card or Apple Support I continued to have to detail the entire ordeal over as if the notes did not exist while new notes were being created. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, as soon as the fraudulent transactions were posted to my bank account and I was able to see the phone number for Apple Cash, I called in to see if I could start a dispute on the charges. At first it was not easy to do because my Apple ID was no longer supported by Apple. Thankfully, because I was the family organizer within our Apple family, using my childs device, I was able to see the email address of the hacker who took over my account -- and was able to provide that email address/Apple ID to the Apple Cash representative. With that information, the representative was able to see all of the transactions. That day, I created a dispute case with Apple Cash representative. She also helped me by blocking the hacker from having access to my children 's accounts. She told me that I should be hearing back from someone within about ten days about the dispute. 

Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, I got a letter from my bank stating that they have granted me a provisional credit for the {$1500.00} while they continue to investigate the fraud. 

Then on XX/XX/XXXX, I got another letter from my bank, with included documents from Apple Cash stating that because all of the charges were done through the wallet using """" XXXX  '' they must have been authorized by user -- and if I felt like I had a legitimate dispute to respond in writing to them. Before I sat down to respond, I called Apple Cash back to check on the status of my dispute, speaking with XXXX, which is when I found out that they had been sending emails and not getting any response. I asked which address the emails had been going to and was told that the emails were being sent to the Apple ID on file. The emails about the dispute were being sent to the hacker himself. Imagine how dumbfounded I was to find out that I had opened a dispute case to get money back that was stolen from me only to find out that the person who stole it from me was receiving emails about the dispute. I was told """" this is just how the system works and you should pray about it. 

The information from Apple Cash stated a few key points which I sent to my bank in my dispute email : This dispute was not from my original dispute, but the banks dispute. 
The phone number of the account holder ( XXXX ) is not mine ( ending in XXXX ) ( nor my husbands -- ending in XXXX ). Our phone numbers have been the same for well over a decade ( I did change my number when I moved from XXXX, NC to XXXX NC in XXXX -- but I've had the same number since ... My husband has had the same phone number for at least 20 years. ) In the dispute paperwork, it says that for tenure """" most recent card added in the last 7 days of transaction. For device trust is a """" new device with not enough history and information to establish trust in the XXXX XXXX. '' The Phone number trust is a """" new phone number on a device '' with """" insufficient history and information to establish trust in the Apple ecosystem '' How was this not called into question? 
At the top of the same sheet, it shows that I sent apple cash to my child in XXXX. Considering the previous tenure/new device/new number, how would any of this be possible if I have been using Apple cash with my debit card, Apple ID ( established XXXX XXXX ), and ( this ) phone ( since XX/XX/XXXX )? 
The Apple Cash was sent to """" XXXX '' which XXXX tells me is a """" prepaid mobile phone. '' I have never sent money to any prepaid mobile phones through any of my apple cash .... And, my carrier is XXXX XXXX XXXX, and have never had a prepaid service. I mainly only send my children money through apple cash, as this is their main way of receiving their allowance. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to an Apple Genius Bar where I was able to complete the process of resetting my phone and getting a new Apple IDwhich will finally allow me to start over in the XXXX XXXX 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Apple Support to update my Apple ID in the system. Then I was switched to Apple Cash where I first found out that the hacker was awarded the dispute, so the money was given back to the hacker -- but thankfully with blocking the account that my first Apple Cash representative did, it locked the hacker from having access to the money. But, I also don't have access to it. Then I was sent to a supervisor who worked very hard to connect a lot of dots to help possibly get the money that I do not have access to awarded to me so that I can pay my bank back. 

Finally, I think spoke with Apple Card where I was hopeful to sort out my Apple Card issues. Previously, I had been given the impression that I could transfer the card account to a new ID ( so much so that I have notes about it ), but I found out on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX that my Apple Card could not be transferred to a different account -- that it would always be associated with the previous account. I asked to close the account, and then inquired about how I would receive my bills, as Apple Card users receive their bills within their Apple Wallet app. I was told that the bill would be sent via email. When I asked the representative if the email containing the bill would be coming to my new Apple ID email or if she wanted another email address, she let me know that the bills would be going to the Apple ID email on the account associated with the Apple Card. Meaning that the hacker will get a monthly email from Goldman Sachs Apple Card with my personal information. I challenged, and begged the representative to change this and not allow this to happen and was told """" there is nothing we can do '' and """" I can put a note in your account. '' I told the representative that I had very little faith in the notes that were left on my account. I asked to escalate to a supervisor above her and was told there was no one who could do anything to prevent the hacker from getting my personal information -- or for me to get a bill without calling in, verifying my identity, and requesting one each month.

I am very concerned about the fact that the hacker already had so much access to my personal information from the security breach that took place when he hacked my Apple ID, but finding out that he got more personal information during the Apple Cash dispute, and that he will continue to get my personal information monthly for the foreseeable from Apple Card until the outstanding balance is satisfied is alarming and should be easily preventable. 

-- - In addition to all of this, I have also created a police report, a report with my attorney general, a report with the FBI, and the FTC.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NC","27103","","Consent provided","Web",2023-11-06,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7804794,2023

If there is a penalty due to my not understanding the complexity of the transaction so be it, but the damage done to my credit does not reflect my credit worthiness accurately and resulted from correspondence between Apple and its credit account partner.

Upon applying for the Savings Account 's prerequisite Apple Card on XX/XX/2023, I was denied due to """" insufficient credit history '' after Goldman Sachs only checked my XXXX credit history, which had a thin file on me. If they had checked my credit history with XXXX or XXXX, they would have approved me immediately. This situation exposes consumers to Goldman Sachs ' bias towards a credit rating company that does not take all possible measures to mitigate a thin file on an individual with a proven high credit score with other rating companies -- especially when the consumer 's ultimate goal is a Savings Account. 

I contacted XXXX regarding this issue and they advised me to plead with transaction parties sending data to other rating providers to also send data to XXXX, which is completely unscalable. 

I suggest the following action items be taken : 1. Apple should fix its Card application flow to have an appeal process with manual triage to review and mitigate obvious case errors. Their robotic denial process currently refers the consumer to XXXX to resolve issues. 

2. Goldman Sachs should reduce sampling bias by asking for credit rating from more than a single provider, namely XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. 

XXXX. XXXX should be held accountable for the consumer experience from a thin file and should be responsible for backfilling data available at other rating providers when a consumer can objectively prove the disparity. 

I request that CFPB investigate this issue and take appropriate action to ensure that consumers are treated fairly by financial companies. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","WA","98103","","Consent provided","Web",2023-04-19,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6862775,2023

When I contacted them after the first payment drafted I asked them to cancel any and all payment drafts that were still showing. Every hour following I continued to receive notifications that payment was drafting. After each notification I kept calling and asking that they cancel them and they refused stating you need to contact your bank and have them cancel the payments because it looks like there was fraudulent activity on your account. When i asked if they would reimburse me any fees that were incurred because of this fraud the rep said he would notate my account. I had to contact my bank to put a stop payment on all of the amounts. I then proceeded to have billing issues with the devices that I had on installments with the Apple Card and reached out to the Goldman Sachs representatives who claimed that in order for my billing issues to be resolved I needed to add a bank account back onto my account with them. I asked to speak to a supervisor again and they only said that there were no other representatives that I could talk to and did nothing to resolve my issue or answer any questions.

She said it rolls over from the previous months balance. When I asked why there would be a rollover if there was no previous balance she said thats just our billing policy.

2023-05-24,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem with a purchase shown on your statement","Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card","Subject : Complaint against Apple Card and Goldman Sachs Bank USA Dear Sir/Madam , I am writing to file a complaint against Apple Card and Goldman Sachs Bank USA regarding a fraudulent transaction that has been erroneously attributed to me. I have taken all necessary steps to resolve this matter with the companies involved, but they have failed to provide a satisfactory resolution. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, a fraudulent transaction was made on my Apple Card in the amount of {$1100.00}. As soon as I noticed the unauthorized charge, I promptly contacted Apple Card support and opened a dispute on XX/XX/XXXX. The charge was temporarily removed from my card while further investigation was conducted. 

However, to my surprise, on XX/XX/XXXX, the charge was added back to my statement. Apple Card and Goldman Sachs Bank USA claimed that after their investigation, they determined that the transaction was legitimate and made by me. This decision is unfounded and contrary to the evidence and information I have provided. 

Despite the assurance in an email from Apple Card and Goldman Sachs Bank USA that I have the right to see the information they gathered to make the decision, their customer service representatives have been unable to provide any details regarding the transaction. They could not inform me of the nature of the purchase, the shipping details, or the recipient 's information. The only information that I was given is that transaction was made in California and/or shipped somewhere to California. 

This lack of transparency raises serious concerns about the legitimacy of the transaction and the investigation conducted by the companies involved.

Throughout this process, I contacted Apple support numerous times to request the promised link for uploading supporting documents. However, days later, I found out that three Apple support representatives gave me false information, apparently, the promised link does not exist and I was finally instructed by the fourth Apple Specialist to submit everything via the phone chat.

The promised link that was supposed to be emailed to me is a myth and Apple Support Specialists seem to be not aware of that. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I compiled all relevant documents demonstrating that I was not in California on XX/XX/XXXX, or any time thereafter. These documents include XXXX record screenshots showing my presence in XXXX, a hotel checkout receipt with the date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and my name on it, a XXXX confirmation email, demonstrating that I was catching the flight from XXXX to XXXX that day, and my ID, which clearly indicates my address in XXXX, FL, not California. 

Today, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received another statement with the charge reinstated, stating that no error occurred and that I authorized the transaction. I want to emphasize that I did not make this transaction, nor did I authorize anyone to do so. I strongly disagree with their assessment, and I am unwilling to accept responsibility for someone else 's purchase.

On a separate note and something that I have included in my communications with Apple Support, I am an avid Apple user, have numerous subscriptions, and bought numerous devices, including XXXX phones in the past year, everything has always been paid and paid on time. I also have impeccable credit and a spotless history with all and any financial institutions I ever had business with. The above behavior is out of character and if anything should have been taken under consideration by Goldman Sachs Bank USA, in addition to the hard evidence provided. 

In light of the unsatisfactory response from Apple Card and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, I hereby request the assistance of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in resolving this matter. I kindly request a thorough investigation into the fraudulent transaction and the actions taken by the companies involved. I trust that the CFPB will ensure a fair and just resolution, based on the evidence provided. 

Enclosed with this letter, you will find copies of the relevant documents, including XXXX  record screenshots, a hotel checkout receipt, a XXXX flight confirmation letter, the entire """" evidence '' file that was put together for Goldman Sachs Bank at the time of the dispute and my ID, which demonstrates my absence from California on XX/XX/XXXX, and my permanent residence in the state of Florida. These documents serve as crucial evidence supporting my claim of innocence.

2023-04-20,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem","Their investigation did not fix an error on your report","Subject : New Complaint Against Apple Card ( Goldman Sachs Bank USA ) for Repeated Inaccurate Reporting and FCRA and CCRA Violations Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to file a new complaint against Apple Card ( Goldman Sachs Bank USA ) for their continued inaccuracies in reporting my payment history to the three major credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ) and the violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act ( CCRA ) and also to clarify the nature of the four complaints I submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) that are now closed. While my initial complaint that is still open for the data of XX/XX/XXXX, is indeed related to the erroneous credit reporting by Goldman Sachs USA Bank, the subsequent complaints were filed due to new and separate issues that arose as a result of the financial institution 's ongoing handling of the matter. 

Since filing my initial complaint as of XXXX XXXX XXXX the following new issues that have impacted my credit report and violate the FCRA and CCRA have emerged, prompting me to submit this additional complaint : 1. The financial institution reported an additional 30-day late payment to my credit reports for a different month than the one mentioned in my initial complaint, further damaging my credit score. The initial complaint on XX/XX/XXXX, only mentioned the XX/XX/XXXX XXXX mark. Since XX/XX/XXXX, Goldman Sachs Bank USA Apple Card changed the 30-day and 60-day late mark to the month of XX/XX/XXXX, which resulted in a drastic change in my credit score. When called about this issue, Apple support admitted they made a mistake, yet had no record in the system of this why XX/XX/XXXX was reported as late by 30 and 60 days, as I was never late. This warrants a new complaint. 

2. A 60-day late payment was added to my XXXX credit report, which is a separate and distinct issue from the previous 30-day late payment reports noted in my first complaint made on XX/XX/XXXX. The 60-day late mark for XX/XX/XXXX, then XX/XX/XXXX, then removed and placed back to XX/XX/XXXX since my initial complaint on XX/XX/XXXX, to CFPB impacted my credit and overall stress during my current XXXX XXXX  When I reached out to Apple Card about this, they had no explanation for why the 60-day late mark was added as they only showed inaccurately that I was late by 30 days which Apple admits is both incorrect. This warrants a new complaint. 

2. The Goldman Sachs Bank USA since my initial complaint on XX/XX/XXXX has repeatedly removed and re-added the erroneous late payment reports to my credit history over two times, first changing the month from XX/XX/XXXX, initially reported XX/XX/XXXX, yet since that time on multiple occasions including removing then reading the 30 days and 60 day late payments on XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX causing confusion and inconsistency in my credit reports. Since my complaint to CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX, Apple, as recently as a few dates ago, noted XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, removed and readded the complaint. After receiving a call from Goldman Sachs Bank USA yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, from XXXX XXXX from the number XXXX, It was shared that the reason for the removal and readditions was because multiple customer service representatives are working on my case. XXXX XXXX with Goldman Sachs Bank USA shared during this call yesterday that some customer service representatives have applied the negative marks 30 days and 60 days late. In contrast, others removed it, showing this is not a computer error but made by people within the Goldman Sachs company despite my multiple complaints and disputes with the company. XXXX XXXX shared he listened to the recorded calls and could only apologize and send in another letter to the bureaus starting the inaccuracies. Yet, since my initial XX/XX/XXXX complaint to the CFPB, this has led to significant drops and changes to my credit since the initial CFPB complaint on XX/XX/XXXX, due to the removal and readdition, and changes to the months reported inaccurately, including the time frame of 60 days and 30 days. 

These new issues are not merely duplicates of my initial complaint, as shared in the four complaints to CFPB notes before, but rather a result of the financial institution 's continued mismanagement of my credit reporting dispute. I kindly request that the CFPB consider these complaints separately and take this new complaint with the developments that extend further than my initial complaint on XX/XX/XXXX, and note the severe violations of the FCRA and CCRA that have been committed by Goldman Sachs Bank USA after the initial complaint, as they pertain to distinct issues that have arisen due to the financial institution 's ongoing negligence in resolving my credit reporting problems. 

Below is an in-depth explanation of how this is a completely new complaint to my initial XX/XX/XXXX, CFPB complaint and should be considered as a standalone complaint that shares the new instances of FCRA and CCRA violations XXXX New Complaint 1 : The XX/XX/XXXX negative mark was moved from the month of XX/XX/XXXX to the month of XX/XX/XXXX since the XX/XX/XXXX, CFPB complaint. This led to my credit score being impacted further with a loss of points. When Apple, Goldman Sach Bank USA was called to ask why, they had no notes or explanation for this change. Please reference the attached documents. 

New Complaint 2 : A 60-day late reporting on my XXXX credit report for XX/XX/XXXX, despite never being 30 or 60 days late after my XX/XX/XXXX, CFPB complaint. Before I was only reported 30 days late, yet I am now being reported 60 days late this showed both in the new XX/XX/XXXX report and then back to the initial XX/XX/XXXX report as of today, XX/XX/XXXX. The complaint emphasizes the significance of the discrepancy and requests further investigation as initially, on XX/XX/XXXX, the CFPB reported the 30-day late mark on my credit for the month of XX/XX/XXXX. 
Since that time of XX/XX/XXXX complaint to the CFPB, Goldman Sach has changed the month I am late to XX/XX/XXXX without explanation or documentation for why- further impacting my credit, written me a letter and has multiple customer service representatives call me to apologize only to remove then readd the negative marks, included negative marks for both 30 days and 60 days. Please reference the attached documents.

New Complaint 3 : Over three times since my initial complaint on XX/XX/XXXX to the CFPB regarding Goldman Sach Bank USA the 30 day and 60 day mark has temporariarly been removed following multiple complaints and disputes to Apple Card directly and most recently to three credit bureaus. Yet they have been subsequently re-added as 30-day and 60-day negative marks by Goldman Sachs Bank USA Apple Card repeatedly to all three credit reporting agencies. Most recently the deletion and readditin happened via both XXXX and XXXX credit reports on XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. Please reference the attached documents. Please reference thetattached. 

These new developments have occurred since my initial complaint to CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX, and warrant a completely new complaint being filed against Goldman Sachs Bank USA Apple Card 's practices as they continue to make new violations to FCRA and CCRA and violate my rights despite admitting both verbally and in writing that these reports or erroneous and in no way my fault but the result of negligent and willful behavior by the company. Due to since my initial complaint on XX/XX/XXXX to the CFPB, Apple Goldman Sachs Bank USA has made multiple removals and re-additions of the negative marks after their removal, coupled with the constant changes in my credit report causing significant damages, demonstrating a continued willful and negligent violation of the FCRA and CCRA regulations. This ongoing negligence has severely impacted my credit, XXXX   XXXX, and family well-being, in addition to affecting our home-buying plans and the closure of one of my {$6000.00} credit cards that I have had for years and overall credit usage. 

I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau thoroughly evaluate the new violations since my initial XX/XX/XXXX complaint to the CFPB against Goldman Sachs Bank USA, for the new violations of the FCRA and CCRA against my rights since my initial complaint on XX/XX/XXXX CFPB complaint. 

I assert that this written complaint is completely different than my XX/XX/XXXX CFPB complaint currently open and thus should not be marked as a duplicate, as detailed above. This complaint here in written should stand alone as a completely new complaint with multiple new violations of both the FCRA and CCRA made after my initial complaint on XX/XX/XXXX that Goldman Sachs Bank USA should be accountable in being held responsible for and responding to. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your assistance in resolving this persistent issue.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","CA","91765","","Consent provided","Web",2023-04-20,"Closed with non-monetary relief","Yes","N/A",6869173,2023

2023-12-18,"Payday loan, title loan, personal loan, or advance loan","Installment loan","Problem when making payments","","Marcus by Goldman Sachs gave no notice to their customers that they would sell off their loans to another servicer. I found out I am caught by surprise and they have now added more challenging work on the customer to get the transparency they deserve about their loan. If one elects paperless, one should still have access to legacy statements from prior months if their customers need to reference them.

Ever since Marcus by Goldman Sachs sold off my loan- which was literally within the last two weeks possibly ( early XX/XX/2023 ), I can't get access to my prior statements from the Marcus by Goldman Sachs online portal. If we were supposed to save those statements prior to Marcus selling off our loan, we need notice to save the statements needed before they discontinue online access to any loan information via the Marcus by Goldman Sachs online portal.

SST is scheduled to autopay/autowithdraw over {$800.00} on XX/XX/XXXX from my checking account, and I have yet to see a statement through the XXXX website. I have no statement visibility via my online account in Marcus by Goldman Sachs online banking portal. 

XXXX 's notice to customers from XX/XX/XXXX was vague and unclear about what we should do if we haven't received a statement. XXXX 's online portal is so terrible that it looks like an interface from the late XXXX XXXX. Not user friendly and hard to navigate to even find their data privacy notice. 

Marcus by Goldman Sachs should've worked in tandem with SST to ensure an effective transfer of the loan, which includes full transparency into my statements from the inception of this loan.

When one agrees to paperless statements and then transfer the management of my loan to some other unknown financial institution WITHOUT my ability to have any control over the decision and one can not see any statements, how am I to understand if the data integrity of the account balances from current and prior months match up with what SST is quoting me today? 

I need the transparency, and I am not getting that with XXXX or Marcus by Goldman Sachs.

This transfer of my loan to XXXX by Marcus by Goldman Sachs was done with no transparency or paper statement mailed to me. If I can't get access to my statements online via XXXX 's ancient non-user friendly web interface for account management, then I should be receiving a paper statement mailed to my address every month going forward. This is not hard to ask for. 

Even though Marcus sold off the loan, they should still be held accountable to ensure we ( the customer ) receive sufficient paperwork or loan statements to assist us with the transition to the new servicer.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","DC","20010","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-19,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8018721,2023

Marcus was advertising on their online portal a 5 % interest rate on this CD. It is to be mature in mid XX/XX/XXXX. I had no issues doing this on the online portal. One week later my online access to check on my three Marcus accts was completely cut off and I was locked out of my accts and they were frozen, restricted. I called Marcus as they have no brick and mortar locations. I was passed from representative to representative at what sounded like a large call center. No one seemed to know why or what I could do. I was repeatedly put on hold and told so and so has to look over the notes, and for me to call back in three business days. That scenario went on for two months every time I tried to get answers. Finally in XXXX XXXX XXXX I was told when I called after being passed from person to person over a two hour time frame that they would mail me an affidavit of identity form to fill out and have a notary sign it. The form never arrived. I called two weeks later to say they never sent me the form. Finally I did receive the form in the mail at the end of XX/XX/XXXX. I filled out the one page form asking me every detail of my three Marcus banking accts, including their account numbers. It also asked extremely private details of my identity including dob, all names used over lifetime including married and status. It asked my mothers maiden and my complete SS #, addresses and previous addresses. And then I was to take it to any notary to look it over and sign it after I presented my valid ID to the notary. In my experience during XXXX XXXX during a real estate sale I was involved with the notary at that time took photographs of all documents that she notorized. I assumed thats what they do these days. Since this seemed to be the case I was not at all comfortable having a random notary who I had no personal knowledge of, look over and photograph every detail of my banking data with my complete SS # in plain view along with as stated previously all my account numbers, addresses, phone number, XXXX XXXX XXXX. since this was my entire retirement funds, it caused me great XXXX to reveal all this information to a perfect stranger, so to try and protect my assets from possible theft I did not put the complete SS # on the form. As is often customary when Ive had concerns like this in the past I xed out all the numbers but the last four of the SS #. I figured this was acceptable common practice and no where on the form did it say it must be filled out completely or it would be rejected. Also the bank already knew my SS #. That was not the issue. The issue was with my name. Marcus was unclear if my first name was XXXX XXXX XXXX Anyhow I returned the completed and notarized form back to Marcus with a USPS return receipt. Which I got confirmation Marcus received it on XX/XX/XXXX. Nothing seemed to change and I was still locked out of my accounts and still had not received any paper statements for any of my Marcus accounts that I opened the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. By mid XX/XX/XXXX I started calling Marcus again but got even more of a run around then previously with no one seeming to know what was going on and why I had no knowledge or access to the status of my funds. I got so frustrated and XXXX over the whole situation I decided for my own peace of mind I would take a wait and see approach since I was at a complete loss about how to gain access to my money again. This went on month after month since XXXX of XXXX. Whenever I called XXXX I got absolutely no answers about anything. Just now in XX/XX/XXXX I have found out through numerous recent calls to Marcus and numerous different representatives spoken to, that my affidavit of identity form that they received from me in XX/XX/XXXX was not accepted by them because I did not put my complete SS # on it. Yet for 6 months they failed to inform me of this or send me a new form to complete to their satisfaction. They had my correct address, mailing address, email address and phone number. Yet they failed to tell me that my affidavit was rejected and all my retirement funds would stay frozen indefinitely. This was for those entire 6 months my only source of money to pay my bills and expenses. I have had numerous expenses over that 6 month period that I could not take care of. I have suffered a considerable financial hardship as a result. Even today I have bills mounting up and businesses angry with me for not paying those bills. It is terrible to be put in this situation after spending my life working and saving to be able to retire. It is only now in XX/XX/XXXX that I have been told this by Marcus that my form was rejected. This week when I called to tell them Ive already lost my car and I may be homeless soon, because of this horrible situation with my savings accts at Marcus. I told them I would like my CD account closed and the money moved into my new account at my new brick and mortar bank. I was told by one of the numerous reps I was passed around to, that they can not send me a cashiers check for my funds or close my account because the affidavit was rejected by them. I am at my wits end, I have no idea what to do to get access and knowledge of my retirement funds again, it has already been nearly ten months at this point.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","CA","947XX","Older American","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-18,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8015891,2023

XX/XX/XXXX, I called Goldman Sachs bank to follow up on my investigation status. This morning, two account specialists told me, my investigation was denied. This is the final result, and no further investigation will be done, they told me. The same day, I called Goldman Sachs Bank requesting a supervisor. The dispute team supervisor, XXXX, confirmed that the previous two account specialists provided me an incorrect information. My dispute is still in the investigation status. Not completed it yet. 
XX/XX/XXXX, the email address as a username of the online banking was updated by me as well. I requested Goldman Sachs bank 's dispute department to keep locking my online banking for security.

The restrictions have not only caused me undue stress and inconvenience but have also resulted in the unwarranted withholding of my own funds. 

Starting from XX/XX/2023, my Apple Credit Card has been restricted three times, with each instance leaving me in an extremely difficult position. Subsequently, my Apple Savings Account was also restricted. Upon contacting the company, I was informed that my accounts were under review, a process they claimed would take a maximum of ten business days. 

However, today marks the end of the third week since the initial restrictions were placed, and no resolutions have been offered or intimated to me. I have made numerous attempts to rectify this situation through Apple Card 's customer service and the corresponding department, yet these attempts have proven to be futile. My requests for a legitimate reason for the restrictions imposed have been consistently ignored or inadequately answered. 

Despite my diligent efforts in escalating my case four times in conjunction with both Apple Card and Goldman Sachs ' team, the responses I received were generic and non-committal. This lack of concrete communication and action from their side has put me in an undesirable position where my own funds are effectively inaccessible to me. 

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter. I trust that you will act decisively to uphold my rights as a consumer and help me regain control of my financial resources.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","WA","980XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-05-26,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7033315,2023

The staff member I met with proposed a service package and price. I was uncomfortable with the price and told her that I could not afford it. She responded by offering an installment payment plan through a third-party company called Greensky. I asked multiple times to confirm that it was NOT a loan product and it would NOT be attached to my personal credit. It was simply an alternative payment option to pay over time as I attended my treatment sessions. I agreed to this payment option. 

A couple weeks later the COVID pandemic began and XXXX XXXX  suspended services. I was ( and still am ) a XXXX XXXX worker working directly with XXXX XXXX  patients. When XXXX XXXX  reopened it was not safe for me to expose myself, XXXX XXXX staff, or my patients to illness for an optional cosmetic procedure. I informed them that I was suspending my service indefinitely and cancelled my appointments. They understood and did not have an issue with this. 

Greensky frequently sent me bills in the mail for these services that I was not receiving. When I would call the numbers on the bills to explain the situation, I could not get through to them. They continued to send bills for services that I was not receiving. Eventually they acknowledged my issue and established internal case number XXXX. Screenshot attached. To my knowledge I never received another update on this case, and I'm not convinced that it was given true consideration or resourcing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX they sent notice that a """" temporary suspension of payment obligations on your Patient Solutions loan due to the COVID-19 pandemic '' would end on XX/XX/XXXX. Yet during this same period of XXXX - XXXX, XXXX they were actively reporting that my ( unauthorized ) payment obligations were past due to credit bureaus. I've attached screenshots documenting this. 

This month I became aware that this derogatory mark for late payments is still on my credit report, which has harmed my ability to pre-qualify for loans, increase my credit limit, and qualify for rental housing, among other issues.

-- Goldman Sachs, through Apple Card, reported a missed payment to the credit bureaus despite the fact that they did not properly send the bill to me.

-- Once paid, it took 3 months for Goldman Sachs to report to the credit bureaus that the payment had been made.

-- My credit score plummeted 80 points as a result of this. It has not recovered.

-- I attempted to resolve it through a dispute with the credit reporting agency and by contacting Goldman directly. Goldman refuses to resolve it.

After reviewing my XXXX and XXXX XXXX determining that he can make it possible for me to get XXXX XXXX, I began to ask him questions about the procedure in terms of pricing. He didn't share the amount immediately, but he did ask me about my credit. I shared that my score was XXXX ( XXXX ), and that I had {$14000.00} cash set aside to pay towards the procedure.

The first set of XXXX boasted a lot of discomfort for me. They were huge, it Hurt when I would try to XXXX XXXX so I immediately shared my concern with XXXX XXXX, I then had a subsequent appointment scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ( see screenshot ) so he can help alleviate the discomfort. He ended up having to create another, smaller version of XXXX  ( he contoured it a bit more this time ). It was a lot more bearable. Next appointment scheduled for XXXX XXXX XXXX was XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. 

However, I MUST NOTE my Disdain because I was completely under the assumption that I was receiving the end-product I agreed to pay {$36000.00} for, which was well communicated to XXXX XXXX that he insisted I would be happy with the completion of the procedure. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, the day the XXXX XXXX were to be installed XXXX XXXX never explained the full procedure to me, nor explained if there was any need for modifications or issues with my XXXX that would prevent me from obtaining the perfect XXXX  I requested with the exact XXXX XXXX XXXX I paid for ( see treatment plan attached ). 
During the operation to my XXXX as a patient I was totally unable to view what was taking place in my XXXX by XXXX XXXX while conducting this transformation. 
Once he was done he stated I have the XXXX and the look I anticipated for so long. Once the mirror was given to me I was told to XXXX  and all I saw was white XXXX  which was a huge difference and a great tone to my face, however I explain to him that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  which look very obvious looking at my face that the XXXX was too big for XXXX XXXX XXXX 
He said that is the immediate appearance thats common for all his patients undergoing this type of procedure and that once the swelling goes down, I would be able to see the difference. 

Days after final installation I reached out, I made complaints to XXXX XXXX that I was not satisfied with the outcome due to the bulkiness of the XXXX that didnt fit my face, and that I was experiencing discomfort while XXXX  ( again ), Extreme sensitivity, and my XXXX was NOT aligned. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I had an appointment, He asked me to come in so he could see what he could do. He continued insisting that he can make XXXX XXXX and contour my XXXX  as small fixes assuming that would do the trick, but I wasn't happy at all! I constantly shared that this is NOT the end result I hoped for. 

I had another appointment on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, to AGAIN, try to arrive at a place of satisfactory, because I continue to have unsightly bulkiness and extreme sensitivity while XXXX. XXXX XXXX again, tried to contour some more, and attempted to further adjust my XXXX 

On XX/XX/XXXX I traveled to XXXX, XXXX for vacation. While in XXXX, my fianc chose to start his process to get his XXXX done with a well known dentist to many in the states. XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. So I made a mental note to question her once she completed the evaluation with my fianc for the purpose of identifying the work done on myself, so as a curiosity she allowed me to be seen for a consultation and informed me that I have all XXXX  in my XXXX which explained the bulkiness of the XXXX that didnt resemble the flat appearance of ACTUAL XXXX. In complete befuddlement, I asked her what can I do to get the XXXX XXXX XXXX I requested and she disappointingly informed me that I was not able to receive that look anymore. 
After being fully educated at that moment with XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX, I learned that for XXXX  your XXXX  would have to be filed down no less than [ XXXX ] so that it can be placed on the exterior of XXXX XXXX As for XXXX your XXXX have to be shaved down even more at a [ XXXX ] to fit over the existing XXXX 
This means my XXXX is shaved down too low to ever receive the look and product I paid so much money for because XXXX XXXX took the liberty to do a procedure I did not ask for without confirming with me what I thought about it or what I feel about it before he did a irreversible operation without my authorization, which was not in our Treatment plan agreement, nor does the paperwork I signed indicate a XXXX XXXX of XXXX to the financial department that helped me fund with these installment loans that I am obligated to pay for ( with interest ). 
The paperwork submitted to each of the above financial companies also received the exact document I received that clearly stated. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
I insisted after I returned from my vacation to XXXX with my fianc that I was going to address this issue with XXXX XXXX one last time with hopes he can explain what he did and what type of material he used to place in my XXXX

As I sat in the waiting room I mentioned the receptionist whom I ask purposely of her opinion for the record to identify why my XXXX are so huge and bulky and her response was said on the recording that she didn't think they were bulky -looking but she sees what I mean. I made sure my Audio recorder ( see audio attached ) was on to get a full statement from the XXXX XXXX that seemed very upset and aggravated with a hint of frustration to my direct questions about XXXX XXXX XXXX  What he stated made no sense to me, and very much not what I was told in the beginning or I would have never allowed myself to sit in his chair to do what he did to me without giving me the privilege as a client or consumer the option to decline or accept his method used. 
Now I have an irreversible situation that will not allow me to reach the perfect XXXX I worked so hard to achieve by saving all my funds accordingly to anticipate this process with great results for the money I was spending. 
I felt very much violated and discriminated against because of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX knowing that if I was of another ethnicity I would not have been treated in such a manner with no regard to what I requested, nor any type of real explanation for so long. 
So I decided to contact the CFPB within the statute of limitations to report this dental office and specific dentist as well as the financial companies that were either lied to by XXXX XXXX of the type of procedure he was doing or participated in the type of procedure received. 
Either way, the paperwork never changed to identify the incorrect work done. ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
In Conclusion, I would like to see the paperwork from each financial company : Green Sky Program  and XXXX XXXX XXXX in full detail that reveals the breakdown of the requested work that was to be performed by XXXX XXXX describing these services that I agreed to pay for. 
If this paperwork has not been corrected with either one of these companies I need an explanation why? And if the documents were changed, why did I not get the change order of the treatment plan paperwork as well clearly stating I received crowns and not XXXX and the reason why? I received NO FURTHER CONSULTATION from XXXX XXXX describing the need to install ALL XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which is what I asked and agreed to pay for, per my attached treatment plan. Furthermore, im also pointing out that I was charged for an XXXX  that I DID NOT receive. This in and of itself warrants an investigation because the paperwork does not match the procedure.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NJ","07017","","Consent provided","Web",2023-04-21,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6867096,2023

Following the opening of this account, I did not receive any copy of the Apple Card Customer Agreement, which is required to contain key information about my account such as the terms of interest on new purchases, details regarding the prime rate, the arbitration provision, and other important terms and conditions. 

To my understanding, this may constitute a violation of the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) and the Credit CARD Act of 2009. These Acts mandate that credit card issuers provide clear and conspicuous disclosures of the account 's terms and costs to the consumer. I believe the non-disclosure of such important information has deprived me of my right to be fully informed about the financial product I have purchased. 

The lack of disclosure has resulted in an unfair and deceptive practice that hampers my ability to make informed decisions regarding my finances. I hereby request the CFPB to investigate this matter, enforce necessary actions against Goldman Sachs Bank USA for any potential violations, and ensure my rights as a consumer are upheld. 

I am prepared to provide all necessary documents and records in my possession to support this complaint.

The representative confirmed the promotional was visible and active on her end but re-enrolled me per my instructions to be safe given my issue viewing it in the app. Then at least 2 more times during the promotional period ( XXXX ) with concern that I was not able to see the status of enrollment in my Marcus application. All three times, Marcus representatives confirmed to me in a recorded line that all requirements were met for the {$100.00} bonus in the system and I will receive the payment if I maintain eligibility until XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX ( two after weeks after the end of the promotional period XXXX ), I once again reached out to the customer service center regarding the missing {$100.00} cash payout. The representative informed me verbally that all the requirements have been met and the delay was driven by a technical issue for which she raised a ticket for me. I called back again in 2 or so weeks later on XXXX and the representative informed me that she also sees the promotional requirements are met but since there was already a ticket raised on my behalf there was nothing she can do. But she did confirm I can move my funds now without endangering my eligibility given I was advised not to do so by representatives in the past. 

It was not until I checked in on XXXX, that the representative informed me that given XXXX my money transfer into a CD account with the same bank on XX/XX/XXXX made my {$10000.00} deposit on XXXX ineligible for the promotion and XXXX the first representative I talk to did re-enroll me but at a later date XXXX than the funds hit my account on.

2023-09-01,"Credit card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Getting a credit card","Application denied","Formal complaint against Goldman Sachs Bank USA for discriminatory and erroneous practices in the credit application process I am filing this formal complaint against Goldman Sachs Bank USA to investigate and resolve what I believe to be unfair and discriminatory treatment in my application process for the Apple Card credit card. Despite having a good credit history, my applications have been denied multiple times for reasons I believe to be inaccurate and possibly discriminatory. 

Background XXXX. Date of first application : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. Date of last application : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. Total number of applications rejected : XXXX Problem XXXX : Incorrect Information on the Credit Report In my most recent application, made on XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed that the reason for the denial was the existence of a """" recently closed CHECKING/SAVINGS ACCOUNT '' according to the XXXX report. I have confirmed with XXXX that no such information exists in my credit history, and to date Goldman Sachs Bank USA has not corrected this error. 

Problem XXXX : Inconsistencies in Rejection Reasons Throughout my many applications, I have noticed inconsistencies in the reasons for my credit denial. For example, on my last application, I was told that they couldn't verify my information, which is incorrect. 





Problem XXXX : Third Party Supplemental Information ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) Goldman Sachs also based its decision on additional information from a third party XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), which I have also verified and turns out to be incorrect in my case. 

Allegation of Discrimination I have observed that people with less favorable credit profiles than mine have been approved for the same credit card. This leads me to ask if I am being discriminated against for unknown and unstated reasons. 

Attachments : XXXX. Copies of all my requests and responses received from Goldman Sachs. 
XXXX. Copy of my credit report from XXXX and other relevant agencies. 
XXXX. Copy of my report from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Resolution Requested I request a thorough review of my credit applications and a detailed explanation of the reasons for the denials. If it is determined that errors or acts of discrimination have been committed, I ask that they be corrected immediately and that my credit application be processed in a fair and transparent manner. 

Since XX/XX/XXXX I am trying to apply for an Apple credit card sponsored by Goldman Sachs USA Bank. This Bank in the course of 1 year has been able to demonstrate what is being discriminatory in unfair with my applications. 
I will attach all the applications that I made during this year and the past where it can show a number of incidents and inconsistencies in the answers. I will attach copies of my credit reports behind junior and other agencies that report credit histories. I am applying for a credit card and consider that I qualify to have it. I also consider that I am being a victim of injustice and discrimination when it comes to receiving a decision. In my credit history you can see that my credit does not have negative information. I only have a few credit cards with a low credit limit for which I am applying for the Apple card so that my credit limit can grow. 
I can show from my credit history that I was worthy of a credit line increase on my XXXX credit card because of my good payment history and that speaks volumes about my commitment to good credit. 
Today in this letter I will detail step by step the unfair process that they have done towards me. It is not the only Bank that has been unfair to me and I have already reported it previously and thanks to the fact that I have reported it this way, the Bank has proceeded to grant me the credit. Example of this XXXX XXXX was unfair to me when it came to denying me credit and I reported it this way and thanks to the investigations that were carried out they granted me the credit. Therefore, I am once again relying on you in accordance with the law to sue Goldman Sachs Bank USA and trusting in a positive decision. 







On XX/XX/XXXX I applied for a credit card Apple Card is a credit card created by Apple INC and issued by Goldman Sachs. My application was denied because Goldman Sachs Apple tells me in the application decision that my XXXX XXXX credit bureau tells them I have a recently closed CHECKING/SAVINGS ACCOUNT. I contacted the company XXXX and a manager informs me that in my credit history it does not appear that I recently had a SAVINGS BANK ACCOUNT OR RECENTLY CLOSED CHECK, therefore, there is incorrect information in the credit application decision. 
I contacted the credit bank Apple Card is a credit card created by Apple INC and issued by Goldman Sachs Apple and a manager responded to me informing me that the only way they can reconsider my application is for XXXX to confirm that there is incorrect information on the card. decision. I contacted XXXX again and they do not have a letter format to send Goldman Sachs Apple bank the rectification that there is incorrect information in the decision of my Apple credit card application and that there are no negative accounts in my credit history. Only they can give me a copy of my credit record, which I must send to Goldman Sachs Apple so they can see that I don't have a recently closed CHECKING OR SAVINGS ACCOUNT on my record. I as a client am being a victim of this injustice. 






Credit denial decisions by Goldman Sachs Apple. I can show the inconsistencies in each of the decisions. Until showing my last recent application where it says incredibly that they can not verify my information that I provide them. 
The bank relies on the fact that this information is taken from my credit history by the XXXX XXXX, in addition to requesting XXXX information from a third party ( Third Party Supplemental Information ) which in this case is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and I attach a copy of My history with this company showing that I have no recently closed accounts. I further request that the bank verify with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX this information and verify it in this complaint. That is to say that Goldman Sachs Apple has no basis to deny me credit and what it is doing is unfair. I can see other people who do receive credit and have credit with late payment accounts and Goldman Sachs Apple authorizes credit for them. Why not me? That is injustice and discrimination.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NY","11372","","Consent provided","Web",2023-09-01,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7487889,2023

Since then, several investigations into the dispute have been opened with fraudulent evidence submitted by the merchant and in the last iteration evidence from my side that clearly proof that the charges are unwarranted. However, Goldman Sachs insists that the evidence from the merchant is sufficient, and the charges are correct. Therefore, I am reaching out to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, hoping to resolve this for once and remove these fraudulent charges. I am feeling severely mistreated by Goldman Sachs and the psychological and emotional distress this process has enforced on me, as a XXXX  XXXX speaker and XXXX  in the XXXX is immense. Please find a detailed description of the events below : On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  I received a message informing me about a {$730.00} charge with the description WF * XXXX in my Apple Wallet. At the same time, I received an email with a FedEx notification and tracking ID XXXX about a package being shipped to my address. At this point this was the only reference number about the order I did not make. I immediately ( XXXX XXXX  ) contacted the Apple Card support team to report this unrecognized transaction. I informed the Apple Card specialist that I have never done business with XXXX before or on that day and that no one had access to my device to make the purchase at XXXX. At the time of transaction my phone and card were in my pants pocket, and I had never used the card outside of the Apple pay app. Additionally, I told the Apple Card specialist that I had already contacted the merchant ( see next paragraph ). As a next step, the transaction was marked as fraudulent, my Apple Credit Card was cancelled, and the card number was replaced. Further, I enrolled in XXXX XXXX protection. Finally the Apple Card specialist told me : I have completed the disputes for you. Since your transaction is pending and hasn't cleared yet, we'll watch if it clears. If the transaction clears in the next two weeks, we'll initiate a dispute and a temporary credit will be applied to your account. If the transaction doesn't clear, it won't show up in your transactions or balance anymore. However, on XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Apple Card Support that the dispute was opened and that they would contact the merchant for further information as the charge went through. I was informed that no additional information is required from me at the time. 

At the same time, I tried to contact XXXX about the order. For this I created an account ( this is required for the customer chat and also to make any order ) and contacted the customer chat. I was told that the reference number ( ID XXXX ) is not from XXXX, that they could not do anything about it, and that I should contact my bank. As an additional step, I contacted XXXX to cancel the package and block the delivery, however, they told me that this was impossible. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  I received a XXXX  envelope ( see picture with reference number and pen for scale ) with the order I did not make. I did not sign anything to confirm the delivery. However, as I did not have any order number or contact, I was unable to send it back to XXXX or the merchant indicated on the package. So, I stored the envelope in my apartment and waited for the evidence or information from the merchant in the dispute. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email that the merchant had responded and that an Apple Card Specialist would review the information. And on XX/XX/XXXX I was informed that the transaction dispute investigation was completed and that the merchant charges remain on my account as The merchant provided sufficient evidence that you made the purchase. I contacted Apple Card Support to ask for the information gathered to make this decision. I received those via mail on XX/XX/XXXX. This information included the proof of delivery ( photo of the envelope done by the XXXX employee ), an email from XXXX, and an invoice from XXXX. The email from XXXX says : We do not agree with the dispute. This is not a fraud order, the amount charged to the customer is valid. All items have been delivered to the customer. The customer has not contacted us to report any fraudulent charges. As an online store, XXXX does not have physical contact with their customers, and is therefore unable to provide you with a copy of the receipt signed by them. We expect that we will not be charged back any portion of the XXXX XXXX. The problem with that is that I had contacted XXXX about the order and was told that there is no order with the reference number I had during the time of the charges ( XXXX ). On the invoice, however, is another XXXX XXXX ID XXXX and therefore they were unable to find it, claiming that I had not contacted them to report the order as fraud. The order product was described as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Chair and XXXX ( XXXX ). Now obviously the envelope I received is not a chair or XXXX  but just two face masks. The invoice says that I have a 30 day return window which had already passed when I received this copy of the invoice. The invoice also does not show my phone number or email address. This might also be the reason for not receiving an invoice in the first place as I do not have an account at XXXX ( which is a prerequisite to order ), and they do not have my email address. Therefore, it is unclear how they could claim that I made the order. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Apple Support to reopen the dispute. I told them : First, I did not order the item. Second, I did not receive the item. Third, I dont have an account at the merchant. Fourth, the merchant never send me a receipt for the order that I have not made. I assume because they dont have my email address or phone number ( as visible in the invoice ). I was told : If we need any additional information from you, this will be requested via email.. Therefore, I did not submit any additional evidence at this time and waited for the outcome of the investigations. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was informed that the transaction dispute investigation was completed and that the merchant charges remain on my account as We further investigated the dispute and reviewed any additional information that may have been provided. Based on our review, the original decision remain because there is no evidence to substantiate the claim. At this point, I had not been asked to provide any additional information or evidence. Once again, I reopened the dispute and asked how to submit my own evidence. I described to the Apple Card Specialist, that I had contacted XXXX with the reference number provided from XXXX and was told that this is not from XXXX. I submitted a series of photos ( see attachment ) with the envelope ( matching Tracking number as in the evidence submitted by XXXX ) with a pen as scale as well as the content of it. I described that this clearly did not contain a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Chair and XXXX ( XXXX ). I also emphasized that I do not have an account at XXXX, never ordered the item, and obviously never received the claimed item. I also said that I never received an invoice and was therefore unable to complain to XXXX about the fraudulent order or send it back within the XXXX policy. In addition to that I emphasized that the phone number on the envelope was incorrect and that their receipt did not show my email address or phone number. If I had actually ordered the item they should have a record of my email address and correct phone number in their system ( which they obviously do not have as I do not have an account or made the order ). I concluded : I expect a full back charge to my card as XXXX ) I did not order this item, XXXX ) did not receive this item, XXXX ) did not receive a receipt to make use of the XXXX return policy, and XXXX ) this is obviously a fraudulent order. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was informed that the transaction dispute investigation was completed and that the merchant charges remain on my account as We further investigated the dispute and reviewed any additional information that XXXX have been provided. Based on our review, the original decision remain because there is no evidence to substantiate the claim. I contacted Apple Support to inquire about whether my evidence had been considered during the process and they said : Any evidence that you've submitted would be looked over while the case was opened. 

It is unclear to me how these obviously fraudulent charges can remain on my credit card. I hope that the issue will be resolved now that I have contacted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It seems to me that the investigations are not conducted in a fair way, and it is unclear how a financial product that is claimed to be secured with face ID and only existent in my Apple Wallet can be used for fraudulent activities that easily. I am shocked about the ignorance of the evidence I submitted and the clear violation of my customer rights. Looking at the CFPB reports this seems to be a common problem with the Apple Card which makes it even more outrageous.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","MD","212XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-10-21,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7733937,2023

2023-12-18,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Closing an account","Can't close your account","On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX  I called Marcus by Goldman Sachs Bank U.S.A. At the following phone number, XXXX I asked that my savings account be closed due to being locked out of my account and denied access to my funds for nearly nine months now. I recently opened a brick and mortar local bank checking/savings/invest accts. and requested over the phone three separate times during the week stated above, that a cashiers check for the funds be sent me at my new mailing address, as I recently sold my home in XXXX XXXX and no longer live or receive mail there. ( As of XXXX XXXX XXXX ) I was told different answers each day I called. Was transferred to numerous different people and spent on average two hours each day on the phone trying to get a resolution with still none in sight. Feeling completely at a loss, I asked my new local banker at XXXX XXXX if he could help me with this problem so I can fund my new XXXX accts before they close them on me and or I owe extra fees due to the accounts not being funded. I explained to him the ongoing problems I have had since one week after inception of these three Marcus accounts. He agreed I could call them from his office and put my phone on speaker so he could hear what they would tell me regarding closing the accounts and wiring the money into the new accts at XXXX or sending me cashiers checks to take to XXXX to deposit on my own. I called two more times with him present both times. Each call lasting well over an hour on Wed XXXX XXXX and Friday XXXX. As was my experience when I called on my own, I was passed around from rep to rep. One person saying one thing, then the next person saying something that was just the opposite. No consistency between reps on the plan of action. And in fact on XXXX the XXXX was told they would close the account but the check had to go back to the institution that funded the acct originally. That seemed rather odd considering the acct was not funded from an institution but from a real estate transaction and was wired in from an escrow company. In any event, the rep did not believe me that the acct was funded from an escrow company wire transfer and refused to take any action on Wed XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX to close the acct and issue a cashiers check to me for the funds to be deposited into the new acct at XXXX. She stated I would need to call back in two or three business days to further discuss how the account was originally funded. In fact she stated she had to do a three way call with my former bank, XXXX to confirm that in fact that XXXX account was now closed. Meanwhile my new banker at XXXX was listening to all of this. All the while I was telling the Marcus rep, XXXX in fraud servicing that the money came from an escrow company wire not XXXX. When she got XXXX on the phone he said he could not confirm or deny anything while being on three way call. After two hours of utter frustration and wasted time. I agreed to come back and call again on Friday XXXX XXXX after she reached out to another rep to get answers on how the acct was funded. I asked my new banker if I could come back to his office on Friday, as we both thought even though it was entirely XXXX  provoking and problematic I was making more traction resolving the long standing communication problems with Marcus bank better with a little moral encouragement than on my own. Although my new XXXX banker did tell me who could not say anything or advise me during my conversations with the Marcus by Goldman Sachs reps. I said OK, since also I am on the XXXX XXXX so I have some difficulty with communication frustration generally speaking. I was grateful for any help with this awful situation. I had a plan that I would go home and try to find some paperwork regarding how that initial savings acct at Marcus was funded so on Friday the XXXX when I called Marcus again, I would have a solid plan to get the new accts funded by cashiers check or wire. I was able to find the escrow company wire transfer paperwork from XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  proving the savings accts at Marcus were funded through that and not XXXX. I was sure it would be just a short call to finalize the closure and return of my funds. On Friday XXXX XXXX I placed the call to Marcus by Goldman Sachs at XXXX XXXX  with the escrow document in front of me in the XXXX bankers office. Rather than picking up where I left off on Wed. With XXXX request of providing proof of how the acct was funded so they would know where to return the funds to from my closed savings account. I was once more given the run around from person to person. Starting all over from square one as if all the previous conversions on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX did not take place. Not only that but each of those previous conversations where nearly two hours in length, not just one liners, but in depth conversations. During this new call I was constantly being transferred and put on hold numerous times. Now I was talking to a XXXX whom said he didnt really care who funded the accounts, because basically I wont be getting any of my funds back because they don't even know if its really me, requesting to close my acct. mind you, Ive provided all the security question answers and Im sitting across from my new banker in his office. XXXX said he could not verify my identity because I did not have my same phone number that I had when I opened the Marcus accounts. My recently acquired XXXX cell phone number that I received 6 weeks ago, of XXXX in anticipation of a long hoped for retirement move to XXXX was still connected to another persons name when he did a public records search. He said he wont be issuing me a cashiers check or closing my account. Then he transferred me to another rep named XXXX who told me I would have to call back again in two or three business days. At this point its two hours again of my and this XXXX bankers lost time. I apologized for wasting the new bankers time. Utterly despondent I said I can not call Marcus any more times. What is going on is beyond belief. I will file formal complaints against this company with the government because this whole entire situation is beyond anything I can get a handle on. Im a XXXX  XXXX  and I have lost access to all my money to pay my basic needs and bills. I dont know what to do anymore. Every passing day my situation is getting worse and worse. Ive already lost my vehicle, because of this situation. I was supposed to be looking for a replacement home and purchasing a new home by now. My family member whom Ive been staying with said I cant stay past another week or two because her boyfriend will be moving in on XX/XX/XXXX. This is an absolutely intolerable situation, to have a bank hold my life savings hostage like this for nearly nine months, Im a XXXX XXXX, I fear I may be homeless soon.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","CA","947XX","Older American","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-18,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",8015377,2023

On XX/XX/2022, I attempted to make a purchase in the amount of {$430.00} at the XXXX XXXX store using my XXXX XXXX. However, the transaction was unsuccessful, and I had to use another credit card to complete the purchase. 

Afterward, I noticed an erroneous charge of {$44.00} on my Apple Card statement, which was clearly an incorrect amount, given the applicable 8.125 % sales tax rate. Upon contacting the store manager, I provided them with the purchase receipt, which was automatically emailed to me at the time of purchase, to highlight the issue. The manager acknowledged the error and promised to forward the receipt to the Sales Audit Team for prompt resolution.

Despite these efforts, Goldman Sachs failed to locate the receipt and deemed it insufficient to resolve the dispute. Moreover, they demanded additional proof from me, even though I had already provided the only evidence available to me. They did not even request the store to provide the receipt for the {$44.00} transaction, which would have been a logical first step in addressing the dispute.

I am writing to request your assistance in this matter, as I have been unfairly burdened with proving the non-existence of a transaction that I did not authorize or make. This request for additional documentation is unreasonable and places an undue burden on me as the customer.

I trust that you will look into this matter and ensure that I receive a fair resolution to this dispute.

This is a nationwide scam, and there could be liability on your part by not completing a thorough investigation. These scammers terrorized me by saying my children were at risk. They knew where my grandchildren went to school. They even sent someone to my home. I do not understand why such a reputable company, such as yours, has no desire to know the facts and return my funds. Wait time on the phone is incredible. Calls are cut off, and it is not uncommon to be sent to different departments with extraordinary wait times. No representative has the authority to say or do anything, and even in a conference call with XXXX XXXX, they had no interest in helping us or wanting to know what happened. I am XXXX years old, a recent XXXX, and you allowed my funds to be stolen. My account was closed, and was told that I would never be able to open an account with that bank.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","FL","XXXXX","Older American, Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2023-03-01,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6627870,2023

On XX/XX/2023, I purchased a sports camera from XXXX, advertised with a 12-day delivery, free returns, and an on-time guarantee. However, upon receiving the item, I discovered that the camera was malfunctioning. I requested a return and refund, but the seller failed to provide a free return label, instructing me to send the item back to a XXXX address at my own expense. 

The seller did not honor their free return policy. Subsequently, I initiated a dispute with Apple Card Goldman Sachs. Despite providing all necessary evidence, the bank failed to resolve the dispute, insisting that I continue making payments. I requested a re-opening of the dispute, but on XX/XX/2023, they again claimed that the dispute had failed. 

I have presented conclusive evidence that XXXX did not adhere to their return policy, proving them to be fraudulent. Moreover, Goldman Sachs engaged in unethical conduct by reverting the funds in XXXX, informing me afterward, and demanding payment without disbursing the funds to the seller. The Dispute Status reads """" Completed ( Disputed charge ( s ) will remain ).

I have been able to enroll in similar plans with every single other one of my other credit cards except the apple card because they do not engage in 3rd party debt consolidation or settlement programs, therefore, I am limited to dealing with them and them only. When I asked for this plan a few months ago I was first told that I needed my account to be past due in order to be eligible. That occurred on XX/XX/XXXX of this year which I was then informed had to be an additional month past due, which recently occurred on XX/XX/XXXX of this year. At that time, I contacted Goldman Sachs apple card again at their collections department who informed me that I was still not yet eligible for that program and the agents indicated to me that they were not sure why I was not showing as eligible for that program in their system. I spoke to a supervisor named XXXX on Friday who informed me that with the agent should never have given me timeframes on when I would be eligible for this program which the information, I was given ranged from one to three months past due and that he apologized for inconsistent information given by the agents. This supervisor XXXX also told me that I should be eligible for the program I'm seeking, which is a long term low interest plan paid off over a number of years with equal payments however it was not showing up in the system due to some IT error. He informed me that he was making a complaint to the IT department about the issue and that he could not sign me up at that time for the program I desired due to the glitch but to call back in a few days and it should be clarified. I have done so and the next day I called and was told by an agent that the manager named XXXX was likely trying to just relieve my frustration and seemed to invalidate or take back the notion that there was an IT glitch causing this plan I required to not show up in the system from my account. At this point I was flabbergasted with confusion as to why a manager would do such a thing and organized a callback from a supervisor with the agent. This callback never occurred from a supervisor and I have been speaking with two agents recently who kept informing me that the only two options are available for payment plans are short term options including a one month deferral and a six month payment plan which, I informed them would not fulfill my needs. I'm at a loss by all the frustration, inconsistent information, lack of kindness and responsibility taken by Goldman Sachs, and having to put my account into further delinquency because I was told that that was the only way to be eligible for the program that I needed.

On XX/XX/XXXX I needed to place a charge on the card and to my supposed it was declined. After calling the bank they told me the payment that large they are going to hold it for 14 days till after XX/XX/XXXX. 

I told the supervisor I needed either the balance or the money back so I can apply the funds to the needed transaction. The supervisor said the fastest way is to just cancel the payment and I will get the money back in my account in 1-2 days. 6 days gone by I still have not received the refund. 

I startede inquiring about my payment on XX/XX/XXXX and I was given the run around either the representative doesn't know or has no access.

I wanted to transfer money directly from my savings account ( at another financial institution ) into my Marcus CD, but unfortunately the electronic transfer software used did not work between the two institutions. I contacted Marcus about other options and was told I would need to send a check. I was given very explicit instructions about the information that needed to be written on the check. I don't have physical checks ( my other bank is a small online only bank ), so I requested a check from my bank for {$2000.00} be mailed to me, and then endorsed the check with all the required information Marcus had provided and put it in the mail. Unfortunately, this process took longer than expected, and by the time the check actually arrived at Marcus, the month-long CD funding window had just closed and Marcus closed the account. I called Marcus on XXXX  to ask about how to handle this, and they said since I no longer had an account, when my check arrived, it would just be sent back to me. On XX/XX/XXXX, however, I was shocked to see that {$2000.00} had been withdrawn as a check deposit. And my Marcus account was still closed, so it didn't go there. The money had been taken out of my account and was no longer in my possession in any way, it had just disappeared into Marcus 's coffers. I contacted Marcus to find out what had happened, and why my check was not just mailed back to me. They said it was """" being processed '' and they would need to cut a new check to send the money back to me. I was told to expect it in 7-10 business days. I did not receive it. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and it was like I was starting all over again, nobody knew anything about my situation. They told me the check was received for processing and asked me what I wanted to do with it. I told them I wanted my money mailed to me, and had been told this was already in process. They apologized, said they were starting the process, and I would receive it in 7-10 business days. Again, no check. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and had a VERY long phone conversation where I was told it was understood how frustrated I was, and they weren't sure why it hadn't been put in properly but it wasn't, but now they were going to expedite my check and would try to get it to me sooner, but at latest, 7-10 business days. On ALL of these calls, I asked about SOMETHING to make this easier ( could they wire the money to my account?? no, of course not ) or confirm the info ( could they at least provide a tracking number when they mail the check so I know it's been mailed? nope ). I was on a trip during the """" 7-10 business day '' window of the last call, so I did not call again until today ( XX/XX/XXXX ), when I was told that there were verification steps on the check that had not been completed, and they weren't sure why, but once the verification was complete they could send me the check. They said the verification was done at the end of this call, and that they are going to send me the check, but they can't confirm anything, and I no longer have faith in their process.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","CA","91107","","Consent provided","Web",2023-11-28,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7915787,2023

Despite providing substantial evidence of the fraudulent transactions to both the bank and the XXXX Police Department, Goldman Sachs denied my claim, citing that the card was used with the chip and/or PIN entered, and thus implying that I was responsible for the charges. 
The fraudulent transactions occurred on XX/XX/2023, and I reported them to the XXXX Police Department as part of a financial fraud investigation ( Case No : XXXX ). The total amount of the unauthorized charges on this account is {$1700.00}. A detailed list of these transactions has already been submitted to the XXXX Police Department for investigation. 

According to the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ), I am protected from liability for unauthorized charges on my credit card account. The FCBA limits my liability to {$50.00} for unauthorized charges, and many credit card issuers, including Goldman Sachs, have a zero-liability policy for fraudulent charges. Despite this legal protection, Goldman Sachs denied my claim and decided to remove the temporary credits applied to my account. 

I kindly request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to intervene in this matter and investigate the unjust denial of my claim by Goldman Sachs. I believe that the bank 's decision to hold me responsible for the fraudulent charges, despite the evidence provided, is in violation of the FCBA and the zero-liability policy.

Please find the attached documents for your reference. I am willing to provide any additional information or evidence required to support my complaint.

On XX/XX/2022 when I applied for an Apple Card. 
I applied for the Apple Card in good faith with the intentions of receiving an Apple Card hence using my credit card ( social security card ). As you may or may not be aware adverse action against a consumer is AGAINST THE LAW according to the Equal Credit opportunity Act which is codified in 15 USC 1691c and is pursuant to civil liability under 15 USC 1692k.

You are subjected to criminally liability for violating 15 USC 1691 as I have proof that I was discriminated against by GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA due to the response I received. 
Since the letter you sent me dated XX/XX/2022 is both a proof and evidence that I have been discriminated against, you are also criminally liable. GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA should resort to reasonable procedures to rectify this affair and compensate me for the use of my social security number. Otherwise, this would be considered an unauthorized use since I have received NO BENEFIT. Following this initial attempt to rectify, I will be sending an invoice to collect actual damages for said violations.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I checked into XXXX XXXX XXXX for a planned two-night stay. Unfortunately, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received the devastating news of my grandmother 's passing. Given the circumstances, I made the decision to check out around noon, a day earlier than planned. The front desk graciously acknowledged the situation and assured me of a refund for the unused night, amounting to {$210.00}. They provided me with a receipt clearly detailing this refund due back to my Apple Card. 

Days turned into weeks, and the promised refund did not appear on my card. Trusting in the reliability and integrity of the Apple brand, I initiated a dispute via Apple Card. However, I was genuinely shocked when the resolution initially sided with the merchant. I reopened the dispute and resubmitted my information, but it was again denied by Apple Card. 

To be clear, I have concrete evidence in the form of a physical receipt which confirms the refund owed to me. It is disheartening to think that despite such unequivocal proof, the matter was resolved against me, especially considering the emotional distress I was undergoing due to the sudden demise of a close family member.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","OH","44001","","Consent provided","Web",2023-10-31,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7780101,2023

I believe this issue may have resulted in an overdue payment and an associated interest charge, despite my efforts to make timely payments.

As a loyal customer of Apple Card, I was disappointed to learn that the due date of my monthly payment was based on the Eastern Standard Time ( EST ) time zone, while I live in the Pacific Standard Time ( PST ) time zone. While I understand that this information is included in the terms and conditions of my account, I feel that it is not sufficiently highlighted or emphasized in the payment interface or other account notifications. As a result, I mistakenly assumed that I had until midnight Pacific Time on the due date to make my payment, and was surprised to find an overdue balance and an associated interest charge on my account on XX/XX/2023. 

I have attempted to resolve this issue with the Apple Card customer service team, but have not received a satisfactory response. I am disappointed with the lack of transparency and accountability in this matter, and I feel that this issue could have been easily avoided with clearer communication and a more user-friendly design.

Apple Card customer service referred me to Page 10 on the terms and conditions, but they should label it more specifically at the beginning.

I gave them a call and got to know I can only set it up after one year of account opening. Now, the question becomes why Marcus has this policy? This is just a setting and customers don't really withdraw money before maturity. The default setting is that CD will be renewed to the rate of that time if there is no further instruction from customers. Obviously, Marcus bank plays a game against customers. If customers like me either forget to change setting after one year or miss the maturity email from them, they can just hold the money for another term of CD. If I try to withdraw money after maturity date, they can charge the penalty. This kind of policy is designed intentionally to hurt customers and is not morally a right business practice. I report this not only for myself but also for other Marcus CD customers. Marcus bank by Goldman Sachs should stop this kind of policy and let customers decide how the money will be handled after maturity when the CD account is just opened.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","WA","98029","","Consent provided","Web",2023-02-18,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6588332,2023

Was hung up on and transferred to a survey line. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Called back to speak to fraud dept. XXXX answered the phone and transferred me to XXXX. XXXX finally sent me a one time code and still did not assist me in resolving this matter. I expressed GM frustration about the process and was told that it had to be escalated to another dept. After continuing my frustration, XXXX hung up on me and did not attempt to resolve the matter. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Called to have account unlocked and spoke to XXXX. Transferred to fraud specialist XXXX and she stated that my information was confirmed, but that the seal could not be read. I also asked why was my account locked and she informed me that it was because of a phone number change. I have changed my phone number several months ago and made several transfers in/out of my accounts. I expressed to XXXX that people change phone numbers all the time and that it didnt make sense. I expressed My name, birthday, SSN, address never changed and that a phone number change should not justify locking an account. I couldve been easily called and asked to verify my identity if I received a PHONE CALL. 
I asked XXXX would I reimbursed for sending in the certified mail as this would be my SECOND time mailing out this form. She stated that she would make a note of it. Thankfully I had copies made of the original blank form. Got the form notarized AGAIN and made copies of the signed form. I went to USPS and sent next day shipping certified mail with signature confirmation for {$28.00}.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","GA","30339","","Consent provided","Web",2023-10-31,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7780039,2023

The ticket confirmation email is attached below. 


However, as soon as I received the above confirmation for the ticket, I realized that I accidentally bought the ticket for XX/XX/XXXX instead of XX/XX/XXXX. This happened because the default ticket calendar page that opened on XXXX 's website showed XXXX dates instead of XXXX dates, and because the dates were represented numerically, I made a mistake and purchased for the wrong month. 

XXXX 's mobile app and website asked me to call customer support for cancellation or date changes. I called kiwi immediately and explained them the situation. They said that whether I change to a different date or cancel the ticket, they would only refund ~ {$10.00} instead of the {$540.00}, even though it was only couple minutes before that I had purchased the ticket. That would have effectively meant no refund. It turns out, this is a scam kiwi regularly engages in and is well-documented at its XXXX page here : https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi.com # Controversies So, I told XXXX that I don't accept their offer and that I would dispute the transaction through my own credit card company. This call happened between XXXX and XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I then proceeded to buy the second ticket with the correct date, which was XX/XX/XXXX, this time for the price of {$560.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, immediately after my call with kiwi XXXX The email for the second purchase is attached below. 



Afterwards, on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX ET, I contacted Apple Card via imessage to dispute the transaction for the first ticket. 

In summary, the time span between buying the first ticket, contacting kiwi, buying the second ticket, and contacting Apple Card support happened within XXXX minutes. 

I have been disputing this transaction since XX/XX/XXXX, which was 6 months ago. Goldman Sachs keeps refusing my request. From my perspective, if Apple Card is not going to protect me in moments like this, then why am I using Apple Card over my XXXX XXXX through Chase, which has protected me during even more difficult situations? 

If there is anything else you want from me to finally resolve this dispute in my favor, please let me know. I have spent over {$110000.00} through my Apple Card since XXXX. If XXXX XXXX XXXX not going to honor my request, then please proceed to cancelling my credit card because I do not want to be a customer to a bank I do not trust anymore. 

In my opinion, a fair resolution to this complaint would be the refund of {$540.00} and a reprimand of kiwi.com for the unfair situation it puts their customers.

2023-01-08,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Managing an account","Deposits and withdrawals","Summary : Goldman Sachs Bank, through its XXXX online banking division, incorrectly set up a joint account by using the primary account holder 's name and combining it with the personal information of the secondary account holder, creating an individual account with account holder information that could not be properly verified because it did not match. Had XXXX followed proper customer due diligence procedures, this error should have come to light at account opening or shortly thereafter. But this error only became apparent XXXX months after the account was established, when what should have been a relatively routine verification of a XXXX transfer from the account resulted in the blocking of the customer 's account for XXXX weeks, despite promises to investigate and resolve the matter in XXXX to XXXX business days. Considerable effort and many hours of phone time were necessary to deal with the largely callous and difficult XXXX bureaucracy to get the account block removed. Further incompetence in basic banking functions rendered XXXX helpless in resolving the basic matter of properly titling the account, an issue that remains unresolved. 

Details : XXXX. I and my wife opened a joint savings account with XXXX on XX/XX/2022. 
XXXX. The account was funded not less than XXXX times since the account was opened, and all deposits were handled without incident. 
XXXX. All seemed to be fine until my wife attempted to process a XXXX transfer out of our XXXX account to our joint checking account at XXXX Bank. We initially received confirmation that the transfer had been processed, but this was later reversed and our account was arbitrarily restricted from all activity. We could not even view our account online. 
XXXX. Our first indication of a problem were calls to my cell phone and emails sent to me asked that I contact XXXX, which my wife initially did. Representatives at XXXX essentially refused to discuss the matter with my wife, despite the fact that she was inquiring about an account that she believed to be an account in joint ownership. 
XXXX. When I called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I was able provide answers to all of their questions, but despite several attempts they were unable to confirm my identity. Finally, after providing identifying information numerous times to several individuals such as the last XXXX digits of my SSN, XXXX, and XXXX security XXXX, I was able to speak to someone in the Fraud area. Here, after questioning the Fraud representative, I was able to learn that the XXXX withdrawal had raised concerns, which only mounted when my wife and I tried to identify and authenticate ourselves. I also learned that the account had been set up improperly, with my name as the sole owner, BUT WITH MY WIFE 'S INFORMATION SUCH AS XXXX AND XXXX LISTED AS MY INFORMATION. This explained the inability for XXXX to verify my identity when I called them. 
XXXX. At this point, with my wife on the call with me, we addressed every question asked by the Fraud employee, explaining that we had opened the account jointly with both of us sitting at the computer and verifying the input. We were emphatic that this was an error on the part of XXXX and not us. Despite all of this, and the admission by the Fraud employee that the account had not been opened properly, we could not get XXXX to remove the block from the account nor would they take any steps to correct the account titling issue. 
XXXX. Rather, we were told that an investigation would need to be conducted and that we would be called back in XXXX to XXXX business days. 
XXXX. Despite the promised follow-up, we never received any contact from XXXX. Instead, we called them ourselves on XX/XX/XXXX, but failed to get a live human being on the phone. The phone system repeatedly forces the caller to press XXXX to remain on the call or XXXX to receive a call back. On the surface, this is a cleverly disguised way to force callers out of the telephone queue through frustration, setting them up for a return call that will likely never be received. Despite waiting far too long for our call to be answered, the option of asking for a call back seemed ludicrous given that they failed to call us back in the first place. We finally gave up, assuming that we would be unsuccessful getting any kind of resolution on the Friday before XXXX anyway. 
XXXX. Receiving no communication from XXXX, we again attempted to resolve the issue on XX/XX/XXXX. On this attempt, we were at least successful in getting the block removed from our account, essentially XXXX weeks after it was put in place. This happened only because of our persistence and our good fortune in getting an account representative who was willing to help by working between what she called the """" backroom '' and the XXXX area. But when we asked her to help get the account titling issue resolved by adding my wife 's name to the account, she ran into problems because the XXXX new account system could not successfully deliver a confirming email to my wife 's XXXX email account ; a real mystery because she has been able to receive other emails from XXXX. Finally we were told that the confirming email would be received by day 's end, but regardless of receipt of the email my wife would need to speak with an account representative again to fully get her part of the joint account set up. THE PROMISED EMAIL WAS NEVER RECEIVED. The duration of the telephone call to XXXX was XXXX hours and XXXX minutes. 
XXXX. On the following day, the account XXXX that had helped us the prior day called explaining that she was unable to get my wife 's name added to the account and she would call back later. When she finally did call, along with her supervisor, my wife was told there was a technical problem on the part of XXXX and it would have to be escalated to technical support. My wife was told that she should be contacted in XXXX to XXXX business days. The time spent on the phone for this interaction was nearly another hour. 
XXXX. XXXX did call again on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, suggesting that my wife file an application for a new account. Doing so would have represented the XXXX such action and she declined and said we would most likely just close the account. After thinking more about it, she called XXXX back and asked to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor did try to help and worked with her to input the new account, but left the phone on numerous times, placing her of hold ( this is something that we experience repeatedly with XXXX reps ). While on hold, the call terminated abruptly. Knowing that she would have to run the XXXX of the XXXX automated telephone system to try to get back to the supervisor - a daunting task at best, she decided to wait for a call back from the supervisor. No one ever called back and this was the last contact we had with XXXX. 
XXXX. At this time, the account remains open as an individual account in my name. It will most likely be closed and the funds moved to a bank that is competent and responsive to its customers.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","PA","17402","Older American","Consent provided","Web",2023-01-08,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6413503,2023

Since having them hold my {$10000.00} for a month was not too unacceptable, I did not do anything further and decided to wait for the affidavit.

2023-06-30,"Checking or savings account","CD (Certificate of Deposit)","Managing an account","Deposits or withdrawals","I have a problem with Goldman Sachs ( Marcus ) that commenced in early XXXX of this year and has not been resolved to date, more than XXXX months later. The bank moved my {$65000.00} CD investment into an inaccessible XXXXosed Accounts File on XX/XX/2023 and has refused to provide me with any verbal or written information defining the problem or the action required on my part to resolve it. They did suggest that I contact Marcus if I had any questions. Since then, I have spoke to Marcus at least 6 times ( I have phone numbers and dates of the calls ). The calls were recorded by Marcus. All verbal and written communications, after the Confirmation of Account Closure, have been initiated by me with absolutely no success. 

On XX/XX/2023, Marcus linked my Synchrony Bank account for a {$200000.00} transfer to a CD Account at XXXX XXXX  APY, and a {$5000.00} transfer to a Savings Account at XXXX XXXX APY ) and my XXXX XXXX account for a {$65000.00} transfer to an 18 month CD at XXXX XXXX XXXX APY ). 

The total {$210000.00} Deposits from XXXXXXXX XXXX  were reversed on XX/XX/2023. Apparently, my XXXX accounts were locked for security procedures due to a hold that I had placed on all transfers from my accounts several years ago. Once I became aware of the security lock, I spoke to XXXXXXXX XXXX and they rapidly reestablished access to these funds which, thankfully, remain in XXXXXXXX XXXX 

The funds appear to have been placed in the Closed Accounts File by the Marcus Fraud Department. It now appears that they wish to identify me. During an early XXXX call, I was informed that they had sent me a letter providing information on their requirements for identifying me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called and told Marcus that I had not received their letter. They stated that the letter had not been sent, but they would again send a second letter. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I took the initiative and sent Marcus a letter resuming my problem and sending the following notarized documents : Birth Certificate, Military Discharge ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ), U.S. Passport, Driver 's License ( FL ), and Social Security. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I again called ( nearly a XXXX hour call were I spoke to 3 different levels of management, remaining on hold most of the time ) to tell them that I had not received the second letter. An check of my address showed that they had the correct address. They recognized that the notarized information that I sent them was sufficient proof, but it had to be submitted on a Marcus format. I asked that their attempt to send the third copy of the letter should be by e-mail, certified mail or, better yet, by XXXX. I also offered to pay the associated costs, if that were the problem. I was left with the impression that a third letter, emails, certified mail and XXXX services required higher management level approval. There was no commitment to resend the third copy, so I am left in limbo. 

Time passes rapidly - it has been 6 months since I opened my CD account and I have received no written and little verbal communications defining the problem or the action required on my part to recover my investment and the corresponding interest. That is all I want - an apology would also help.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","FL","XXXXX","Older American, Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2023-08-03,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7186766,2023

The following week right after I was approved I inquiry and requested my SCRA benefits being applied to this account since I am a military in XXXX XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was denied the benefits, and their reasoning was that they only grant the benefits to service members that apply for the card before being ordered to XXXX XXXX. Basically since I applied for the card while being on XXXX XXXX I do not qualify. I sent my military orders and even a memorandum signed by my commanding officer stating that to the date of the request I was actively serving as a service member, because at first the military order alone wasnt enough for them. Which it makes no sense, they were asking for another military order on top of the one that I currently provided which that tells me that they dont know how a military order works ( My current military XXXX XXXX order runs until XXXX ). I never had this bad of an experience with another mayor bank. Currently I have the benefit applied to 3 other accounts in different banks and never had a issue. 

After it was denied, I requested the policy that they used to disclose and determine who qualifies to the SCRA benefits. I requested the policy via email and by mail. They never replied. The information of the bank on the topic is very vague on the internet and out of the 3 times that I called no one could tell me what was their policy. They stated that a supervisor informed them that I was not qualified but could not provide the policy or regulations they guide themselves to this types of process. Still I am waiting for the document that discloses who and how any service member qualifies for this particular benefit and how they based their decisions. 

To my understanding, the requirements to receive the SCRA benefit applied is only to provide a military order proving my current XXXX XXXX status. I would appreciate if you can help me to get to a resolution to this issue, weather it is a document informing the actual requirements or to actually get the benefit applied.

The first transfer request of {$3000.00} was made on XX/XX/XXXX through online banking with a 1-3 business day wait. 
This transfer was reversed on XX/XX/XXXX, but without any notification. 
Logging on on XX/XX/XXXX, seeing it was reversed I used the online """" chat '' function to learn the error was mine, I had initiated a transfer to an account that I had closed. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I linked a new external account to Marcus ( my personal checking account with the same external institution as prior ) initiated a transfer request for {$4000.00}. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call from an agent at Marcus, who wanted to know before she could authorize the transfer, what my savings goals were, and what the funds were being used for ( purchase, vacation ), as I had not had the account open for very long. This was not a money laundering security question. The agent confirmed the transfer and that it would take 1-3 business days. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, noticing the funds were not in the external institution account, I checked on the transfer by logging in to Marcus and saw that the transfer had been reversed on XX/XX/XXXX without explanation. I used the online chat function to be told I needed to call. I called Marcus, and it took the agent 45 minutes to ascertain that the transfer had not been initiated because my account needed a review, which could take 2-3 business days. If I had not heard from them in that time to give a call back. At this point it just appeared that Marcus did not want to make the transfer. Alternatively, the agent said she could send a check that could take 7-10 business days to arrive. I did not trust the institution to do this, but it appeared to be another delaying tactic for making the transfer. 
However, on this same call of XX/XX/XXXX, I therefore asked for the account to be closed. I was told that the account will be closed today, and a check with interest would be issued and take 7-10 business days to arrive. I have not, as yet, receive any notification by email that the account has been closed, and it is still available to me online.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","VA","22903","","Consent provided","Web",2023-03-27,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6755794,2023

Marcus halted the transfer hours later in order to verify the external account. Marcus called me and left a voicemail. I immediately returned the call on XX/XX/2023 and initiated the account verification process with a Marcus agent via telephone. After long hold time and being transferred around agents, an agent notified me that he must call the bank where my external account is held in order to verify the account with me on the line. I held for over thirty minutes while the agent attempted to contact the external bank before ultimately telling the agent that I had to end the call and follow up with Marcus on the next business day. The agent proceeded to lock my online account, limiting me from accessing both my Online Savings account and investment account until I called Marcus again. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Marcus to unlock my account and attempt to verify my external account in order to proceed with my requested transfer of funds from Marcus to my non-Marcus account. After more hold time and transferring to other agents, I was led to the correct agent who tried to send me a two-factor authentication code via SMS to my number on record. The SMS was not received, likely due to an issue on Marcus ' side, as my mobile was operating normally. The agent spent almost 30 minutes trying to resolve the SMS issue after telling me Marcus has no other way to perform two factor authentication. After 30+ minutes, I finally received the two factor code, which allowed the agent to finally speak with me regarding my locked account and transfer issues. Again, the agent tried to reach the external bank, which led to further hold time. Having to go to a work meeting, I requested that the agent stop trying to contact the non-Marcus bank and cancel my transfer request after unlocking my account, so I could instead transfer the funds under a new request to a different external account that Marcus previously authenticated. The agent confirmed she unlocked my account and canceled the transfer, so I could proceed with a new ACH transfer request on my own. 

On XX/XX/2023 and XX/XX/2023, I attempted to transfer my available funds from my Marcus Online Savings account to any of the three previously authorized non-Marcus accounts saved in my Marcus online account. Each time, regardless of the transfer amount requested and saved/authorized account chosen as the target, I received a technical issue error, which halted me from transferring/accessing my funds. I attempted over 10 transfers varying from {$.00} to $ XXXX to three accounts via wire transfer and ACH transfer. Each attempt was blocked by a technical error on the Marcus XXXX  app and Marcus website via multiple types of computers/devices. 

On XX/XX/2023, I again called Marcus to complain that I could not access my funds. After hold time and multiple transfers, an agent attempted on my behalf an ACH transfer to an authorized external account, which was also blocked or failed without reason. The agent transferred me to a back office agent, who found no locks or issues with my account. After further hold time for investigation, I was transferred to another agent who attempted another ACH transfer that failed. She ultimately """" manually '' pushed the ACH transfer and confirmed that it would be completed in 1-3 business days. I received no transfer confirmation receipt email and there are no transfers schedule or pending in my online account, so it remains to be determined whether my funds will ultimately escaped the grasp of Marcus.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","FL","32244","","Consent provided","Web",2023-03-28,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6763652,2023

The denial reasons asserted lack of substantial credit history and insufficient payment history, among others, despite my maintaining a credit account with XXXXXX/XX/XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX, with consistent and up-to-date reporting until at least XX/XX/XXXX. These denials, combined with the ambiguous and inconsistent criteria employed to assess credit applications, seem to infringe upon the mandates of the ECOA that restrict discriminatory practices in credit transactions. 

Furthermore, my interactions with the Bank and XXXX have revealed disparities and contradictions in the management and communication of my credit information, its disclosure to third parties, and its utilization in credit decisions, potentially breaching the FCRA which stipulates the necessity for the accurate and fair communication of credit information. 

The following actions detail the aforementioned disregard for regulatory compliance and have imposed significant, tangible harm : Inconsistency and Opacity : Observable discrepancies exist between the information provided by the Bank and XXXX, and the covert use of third-party information in decision-making processes without clear disclosure of these practices. 

Neglect of Robust Credit Information : Denials have been issued using arguments of """" insufficient credit history '' and """" insufficient payment history, '' despite a demonstrated history of reliable credit management. 

Baseless Credit Denial : Differing reasons for credit denial have been provided across various applications, pointing to a lack of clear and consistent criteria in the Banks credit decisions.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NY","11372","","Consent provided","Web",2023-10-11,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7671343,2023

I made my first phone call to Marcus on XX/XX/XXXX. They refused to tell me why my account is locked. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Marcus, they refused to tell me why my account is locked.

In order to have the option to return the bed if I was not satisfied, I opted to purchase additional items, bringing my total to {$1800.00}. 

However, upon receiving the bed, I was extremely disappointed to find that it did not match the description provided. Specifically, it was advertised as a cooling bed, which was not the case. I promptly contacted XXXX XXXX and Apple Card to discuss the issue and was informed that I could return the bed. However, I was also informed that XXXX XXXX does not arrange for pick-up and suggested that I donate the bed instead. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX offered me an alternative solution. They proposed that I could keep the mattress and only pay {$380.00}, with the understanding that I would donate it. In an effort to comply with this arrangement, I carefully packed the mattress back into its original box using rope and tape. 

However, when I informed XXXX XXXX about the steps I had taken, I was informed that I had violated your policy by not removing the bed from the box and therefore, I would not be able to return it. I strongly believe that this accusation is unfounded and a result of a misinterpretation of my communication.

I have provided hard copies of documents to Goldman Sachs Apple Card through certified mail, and I have sent numerous text messages and emails to Goldman Sachs, expressing my concerns.

I feel trapped in a deceptive game orchestrated by XXXX XXXX, and I am at a loss as to what steps to take next. It is particularly disheartening that Goldman Sachs Apple Card, who I have always regarded highly, has not been of any assistance in resolving this matter. Their lack of support and failure to stand by their customers is truly disappointing. 

I kindly request that you address this issue promptly and provide a resolution that is fair and satisfactory. I have always been diligent in ensuring that my credit cards do not accrue interest, and I would appreciate your cooperation in rectifying this situation.

I was going into the insurance business and it was a dual funnel system to generate leads for me. I thought, great, if this program works to generate leads for me I dont have to buy any from sketchy vendors, nor chase leads as the program said helps to reduce. I set up a call to learn more. I got on the call XX/XX/2022, the salesman said that I would have a personal mentor who would help me set up the program to generate leads and that I would make {$30000.00} per month. I purchased the program, paying half, {$3900.00}, at the moment and the salesman did not mention when I would have to pay the rest, but that he wanted me to see the program and swore on religious practices that it would be helpful. He also mentioned that if the program was not a good fit, that I could withdraw and receive a refund. 
AFTER they charged my card, they sent me a docusign, which he said I had to sign, which was the terms of service. Out of good faith, I signed. I got access to the program. 
I then saw that they were all modules, it was a classNOT a program that would generate leads for me. I had to do it all. 


I was deceived into making a purchase for a service to generate leads for me. The sale was over the phone in which no payment plan details were given nor was a receipt stating what it was I was actually purchasing and I paid half of it in the moment. I started the program I purchased, and it was not as agreed or described by the salesman. 
I used my Apple Card. 
I requested to cancel with the merchant the following week, given that the salesman on the phone said I could if the purchase didnt fit my needs. I talked to the salesman on the phone, he said he would talk to his higher ups but that he wanted me to really give it a chance. He also said that I would not be charged for the other half of the price until we came to a resolution. He never got back to me, the following month I was charged the second half, and then began the dispute with Apple Card. 
The dispute has now ended a few times not in my favor. Multiple times I have submitted emails showing that the merchant stopped responding to me on multiple different occasions. Goldman Sachs/Apple Card is not even looking at my evidence nor considering it. I do not feel heard at all by Goldman Sachs/Apple Card with my dispute.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","FL","32811","","Consent provided","Web",2023-08-07,"Closed with non-monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7364715,2023

Despite my history as a responsible and compliant account holder with XXXX XXXX for eight years, the transition to Goldman Sachs brought about unanticipated challenges that have gravely impacted my credit report. 

Inaccessibility to XXXX XXXX Account : During the transition, I was unable to access my account, hindering me from managing my balance, bills, and other related matters. 
Failure to Receive New Card : Despite numerous communications with Goldman Sachs ' customer support, the delivery of my new card was mismanaged due to an outdated address error on their part. 
Delays in Issue Resolution : The misdelivery caused further delays in receiving my new card and accessing the new Marcus account, despite multiple assurances from the bank 's support staff. 
Erroneous Credit Report Delinquency : An unwarranted credit report delinquency was reported during this period, which I promptly settled upon gaining account access, but the delinquency record persisted.

Adverse Impact on Mortgage Application : This incorrect delinquency report is now adversely affecting my mortgage application for a home purchase. 
Unfruitful Resolution Attempts : Despite my earnest efforts to resolve this with the concerned parties, I have encountered resistance and inaction. 
Moreover, the delinquency was re-reported on my credit report even after submitting two complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) whereupon the bank acknowledged a technical error and refunded the outstanding amount to my credit card account. It is perplexing and unacceptable that the delinquency has re-emerged on my credit report despite these remedial actions. 

I hereby urge your immediate attention and action to rectify this erroneous delinquency reporting. It's imperative that this issue is resolved expeditiously to prevent any further detriment to my creditworthiness, and to facilitate my ongoing mortgage application process. Should this matter remain unresolved in a timely manner, I am prepared to pursue legal action against the bank to ensure the removal of this unjust delinquency from my credit report, as it stands as a significant obstacle in my home purchasing endeavor.

Enclosed are the relevant documents supporting my claims. I am keen on working collaboratively to resolve this matter and I am available for any further discussions or document submissions as may be required. I look forward to your prompt response and action to rectify this unfortunate situation. 

Thank you for your attention to this critical matter.

The initial fraudulent charge occurred via online transaction ( for in-store pickup ) on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$1500.00}. This was reported to my credit card company. A temporary refund was received on XX/XX/XXXX as an investigation was launched. However, we were notified that this was reversed via email on XX/XX/XXXX. 

The merchant 's invoice receipt indicates the online order was selected for in-store pickup at a store in a city 2 hours away from where I reside. The individual picking up the order had a fake ID that had my name on it. A police report was filed in city of residence, which was then forwarded to the police department that the crime occurred as it was in a different jurisdiction ( the report was provided to the credit card company ). Additionally, the pickup receipt indicates the order was picked up on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX. At that time, I was at work and there is no possibility of this ( I provided the credit card company with a written statement from my supervisor to back this up also ). This is a clear indication of identity theft ( police report and statement from supervisor proving it could not have been me ). As an XXXX XXXX military service member, I would need prior written approval to be absent during work hours, which did not happen. 

I was contacted by the police department that the crime occurred in and notified that that they are unable to obtain surveillance footage from the merchant, as they do not keep footage more than 60 days old. By the time we received the dispute outcome on XX/XX/XXXX, it had already exceeded this time frame and the police department was not able to assist me. 

Fast forward six months later ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I have re-opened the dispute a total of 3 times now. They keep rejecting my evidence/dispute without providing an explanation.

2023-09-06,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Managing an account","Deposits and withdrawals","I opened a Marcus account ( XXXX ) to save money for an Emergency situation due to their high interest rate offer. I called ahead and their agent confirmed on the phone that there are no limits to the amount I can transfer from other banks and the number of transfers. I WAS NOT TOLD THAT THE MONEY HAS TO STAY FOR 90 DAYS NOR HAVE THEY MENTIONED ANY OTHER RESTRICTIONS. I started transferring money to my Marcus account from my personal and business accounts. Once I saved enough money, I called Marcus transfer it out for resolving my Emergency situation. Marcus agent initiated the transfer ( around last week of XXXX ) and later in the day, my account was locked and the transfer was reversed. I was transferred to a specialist who gloated that there's nothing he can do. The agent showed no empathy and borderline disrespectful. I called Marcus later that night and expressed my frustration and the fact that they are dealing with human beings, not account numbers and it's the customers money. The agent acknowledged the mistreatment and asked me to call again the next day. I did. I was told that I need to transfer {$140000.00} to my Chase business account which I immediately did over the phone and they unlocked my account. A day later, I transferred rest of the money to my personal account ( pnc ). Later that day, they locked my account again. Their specialist now says that the correct amount to be transferred to my business account is not {$140000.00} but {$87000.00}. I spent the next hour over the phone to complete the transfer to chase and XXXX. 

I made multiple calls and multiple request in late XXXX to transfer the {$87000.00} to my Business account which was completed. I asked them to send me the remaining money as a check to my home address. They said that they can wire it instead and it will be faster on XXXX and close my account as I can't take this anymore. I asked them to double check with their specialists/fraud team that they will not cancel this later. They confirmed that it will go through in the next 2-3 business days. I literally cried on the call because of everything that they have done to me and begged them to not cancel this and add all of this to the notes. I broke down in to tears because of what Marcus is doing to me due to my emergency situation and I need my money urgently. 

I followed up with them on XXXX, XXXX and they said that it's all good. On XXXX after multiple calls, they canceled the wire transaction again! 

I cried again over the call and after spending hours over the phone with multiple supervisors and specialists and agents, they said that they will send the check and close the account and that it will take another 2-3 business days for me to receive my own money.

I have zero confidence that they will deliver on this. I have suffered significant irreversible monetary and emotional damages because of the way Marcus has treated me. 

They kept calling me multiple times about a {$25.00} good will credit. I don't want their money. It's an insult to all the injuries that they have caused me. Please stop making these calls and please stop brining this up. 

I feel helpless and Marcus is going to great lengths to punish me. I do not understand why. I beg Marcus to help me close my account and send the entire remaining balance to my home address XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NJ XXXX expeditiously without any delay ( with tracking ) by XX/XX/12. PLEASE STOP LOCKING MY ACCOUNT. 

I urge Marcus to take this issue seriously. Their teams do not talk to each other and are screwing customers like me. One team member initiates a transaction promising the customer that it will go through and another team member from fraud team will cancel it later. They require all funds to go to the original accounts. I told them repeatedly that it's not possible as I liquidated some of my accounts when I deposited the money and there's no way to send the money back. I explained this to them multiple times for the past few weeks. They acknowledged it multiple times and they keep canceling my transactions.

I still have {$150000.00} locked in their account and they are refusing let let me withdraw my own money. 

They have consistently lied to me. One of their frontline teams would take my request to transfer my money out. Their security/fraud team would later cancel the transaction and lock my account consistently. 

They kept giving me misleading reasons for locking my account contradicting what their previous agents say. They re-used the same transactions that they referred to for locking my account to lock my account again a few days later. 

I told them repeatedly that I can't move my money back to the original accounts as they don't exist. They refuse to let me withdraw my money and they refused to close my account. 

They have caused me severe emotional and mental distress by continuing to lock my account and forcing me to call them several times a day and keep verifying my information again and again. 

My account was locked over 5 times in 2 weeks. My transfer requests were denied more 6 times. 

Here 's another example of their blatant lies. I made a request to close my account after I couldn't take their harassment anymore ( request # XXXX XXXX ). They promised to close my account and said that they checked with their fraud team that my account would be closed for sure. Few days later, they cancel my request claiming that money has to the original account. As stated earlier, I already cleared with their fraud/security team that I don't have the original accounts opened for the money to go to. 

After hours of phone calls, transfers, talking to their supervisors, I requested them to close my account and send my money asap ( request # XXXX XXXX ). They again checked with their fraud team, let me know that everything is good, made me wait for a few more days and canceled my request again and locked my account again. They lied again Their harassment and targeting of me continued. I again made a closure request, begged and cried over the phone to help me access my funds ( request # XXXX XXXX ). They again canceled my request sneakily and locked my account again. 

At this time, I have taken severe financial losses and tremendous emotional and psychological pain because of the way some of their agents lied to me, disrespected and continued to contradict each other. I had to call them over 12 times today. I had to verify myself over 15 times just today. I had to get my account unlocked again and again. They would promise to call me to complete the verification but not call me back every time they were supposed to. I made another attempt to close my account ( request # XXXX XXXX ). They again promised to send me my money to my home expeditiously and after being lied to and played by their support team members. They continue to lie to me and continue to target me for some reason. 

I do not understand why they are being so cruel, disrespectfully and not close my account and continue to torture me. I cried over the phone with their agents. I begged them over the phone. I expressed my pain and suffering pretty much every day over the last few weeks.

When I asked a phone agent to close the card because it wasn't worth this hassle, my request was refused. 

I opened this card for the cash-back benefits for Apple transactions , and I've been entirely unable to take advantage of those, and instead used a card that only provides XXXX XXXX instead of the advertised XXXX  XXXX  I applied for this card to use. 

Long version : XX/XX/XXXX  Applied for Apple Card. The application was approved with a {$8500.00} credit limit. 

I purchased a XXXX XXXX through the Apple Store App for pickup in-store for pickup that day, the card worked fine for this ( and two small transactions, one in the store, and one App Store transaction on my new laptop ). 

Later that night, the card was blocked for review. I received a voicemail asking me to call in, did so. I had to go through an identity verification process and was told the """" Identity Theft Alert '' on my card would be removed. 

XX/XX/XXXX  Decided to return the XXXX to get a model with different specs. I tried to place an order using the Monthly Installements option through the App Store ( same as my initial purchase, but a different purchase amount ). The transaction was declined, despite the credit limit being sufficient to cover both this purchase and the pending transaction for the laptop I was returning. I tried two more times to see if it was just a glitch, including one time using pay-in-full instead of the Monthly Installments option. The last order ( pay-in-full ) went through. 

A few hours later, I received another voicemail asking me to call in. I did, just to be told that my """" account was under review '', and there was nothing they could do over the phone ( so why leave a voice mail telling me to call in the first place? ). I mentioned the issue with the pending transaction ( the pay-in-full order that went through ), and the agent told me they would try to escalate the review. 

XX/XX/XXXX  Received an email from Apple that there was an issue with the payment on the order and I needed to update my payment method. My Apple Card was still blocked, so I had to call in to add a different card to the order, one with significantly worse cash back returns for this transaction. 

XX/XX/XXXX  My card was unblocked. I attempted to place a new order, using this card, for the XXXX XXXX specs I wanted ( intending to cancel the order that was charged to my other card ), and the transaction was declined yet again. 

A few hours later, I noticed ( unsurprisingly ) that the card was blocked again. 

I called in, waited for 20 minutes on hold, and had to hang up. I called in again and was able to speak to an agent. I explained this whole story to her. She put me on hold and came back to say my account was under review ( *again, * for the same purchase that was blocked, reviewed, and cleared over the weekend ), and there was nothing she could do other than tell me to wait out the review -- which I'd already done once, and had no reason to believe would have any different effect than it did the first time. 

Unsatisfied with the options, I asked her to just close the card. I was told that couldn't be done while the account was under review. I asked if she could leave a note on the account to close it as soon as the review was completed. She said she was making notes, but that to close the account, I'd have to call back in again after the review was completed. At this point the call quality degraded, I could no longer hear what the agent was saying, and, extraordinarily frustrated, hung up.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","VA","23223","","Consent provided","Web",2023-09-25,"Closed with non-monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7603289,2023

Goldman Sachs FACTS : The plaintiff has been a customer of Goldman Sachs and its Apple Card service for the past two years. 
Over the course of the past two years, the plaintiff has identified excessive charges and false information on their bank statements and Apple Card reports. 
The plaintiff has spent four months trying to resolve the discrepancies with Goldman Sachs. 
Goldman Sachs has refunded a part of the plaintiff 's claim but has not provided a full settlement for all the damages incurred. 
The plaintiff seeks a settlement for all the damages that have been incurred as a result of the billing error, which includes the excessive charges and the missing money in the XXXX for 2021.

ISSUE : Whether Goldman Sachs is liable for the billing error that has resulted in excessive charges and false information on the plaintiff 's bank statements and Apple Card reports, and if so, what is the appropriate settlement amount for the damages incurred? 

RULE OF LAW : Under consumer protection laws, financial institutions have a duty to provide accurate and timely information to their customers, and they may be held liable for billing errors that result in damages to their customers. 

ANALYSIS : Goldman Sachs is responsible for providing accurate and timely information to its customers, including the plaintiff in this case. The excessive charges and false information on the plaintiff 's bank statements and Apple Card reports indicate a billing error that has resulted in damages to the plaintiff. The fact that Goldman Sachs has refunded a part of the plaintiff 's claim acknowledges their liability for the error. 

The appropriate settlement amount for the damages incurred will depend on the severity and length of time of the error, as well as any damages that the plaintiff may have incurred as a result. The plaintiff may seek a settlement that includes compensation for the excessive charges and missing money in the XXXX for 2021. 

CONCLUSION : The plaintiff has a strong case for a settlement with Goldman Sachs for the billing error that has resulted in excessive charges and false information on their bank statements and Apple Card reports. The appropriate settlement amount will depend on the specific circumstances of the error and any damages that the plaintiff has incurred as a result. A lawyer may help the plaintiff negotiate a fair and reasonable settlement amount with Goldman Sachs based on the strength of their case","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","FL","33138","","Consent provided","Web",2023-04-26,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6885761,2023

They are doing corrupt business practices and they need to be investigated. 

1. First of all there were 13 {$1000.00} charges and I will attach them. 
2. They were all fraudulent charges even though in their response to my first complaint they stated they found no proof of fraud. The reason why they are saying that is because they are tied in with Stripe and have an agreement with them that if fraud is reported it falls back on the bank. Stripe is also tied in with XXXX XXXX which is based in XXXX one of the most corrupt countrys in the world. I will send you proof of that. The merchants evidence came from XXXX. I have chats from their specialist stating they were all reported as fraud and I will enclose those chats. 
3. Goldman Sachs says there were 74 disputes. If you add up all the disputes that I won it comes to 83. This is calculated from the numbers they gave in their response to my previous dispute. They say 10 were duplicates and was reversed in my favor. Then there were 29 disputes that were resolved incorrectly and they were reversed in my favor. They stated that I reopened 57 transactions in XX/XX/2023 through XX/XX/2023 and thats a lie. There were only 5 reopened in that time frame and I will send them. Out of those 57 disputes they state that 44 of them were resolved incorrectly and were resolved in my favor. Thats a total of 83 disputes in my favor. This is a bank and they cant add? They state there are 13 disputes left that they are investigating. That brings the total of 96 disputes total. There are only 5 outstanding and 4 of them is for XXXX and XXXX for XXXX. This is a bank and we are suppose to trust them with our money! My account has a XXXX balance and I had already payed those charges for XXXX before the disputes were even made. I have proof. I made a XXXX payment in XXXX. 
4. They stated in their response that the Bank confirmed the credit reporting is correct and accurate, another lie. 
5. I received this morning from Apple Card notifications of dispute adjustments to my account and I will send them XX/XX/2023. These were resolved in XXXX and they are just now crediting my account. There are still XXXX more {$1000.00} to be credited to my account. The reason they did not credit my account when they were processed is because it would have made my line of credit to have a plus of {$10000.00} or more. They would have to give that money back to me. That is why they closed my account. 
6. All these disputes are fraudulent and they know it. I never gave XXXX XXXX my account number, CVV number, PIN number, I do not use the fingerprint ID or Face ID. I did not authorize any of these transactions. The XXXX address that XXXX XXXX provided as evidence is not mine. 

I do not tolerate corrupt activity and do not want this to happen to anyone else, but have to think with all the complaints I have read on XXXX I have to think they have done this before and I am not the first, They have blocked me from accessing my account so I will not receive my monthly statement.

Which he paid for using his girlfriends Apple credit card, with her permission. While staying here I witnessed him on numerous occasions call the cc company to make false claims about purchases he indeed was responsible for. After witnessing his shady behavior first hand as well as him stealing money from my bedroom, we asked him to leave once his XXXX day was up. In retaliation he has called the cc company to claim that the {$520.00} payments that we processed using our square cc reader were supposedly fraudulent charges not made by the account owner. 
So when I received the charge back from XXXX, I contacted the account holder for the Apple credit card, which was XXXX XXXX ( XXXX girlfriend ) and she claimed to have no knowledge of XXXX using her cc, which I know is a lie, because when I heard him call the Apple credit card operators, they had to send a verification code to the account holders phone number on file, since he was calling from his phone and not her phone number, she would receive the text message verification code and then text it to him so he could repeat it to the customer service operator and get access to her credit card account. Not to mention on a couple occasions he needed to order a new credit card, because the card he had was stolen ( another fabrication to charge off his purchases ) and in order to activate an Apple credit card, you need to put the box that the new credit card came in, next to the account holders phone, and thats how the new credit card gets activated. So in order to turn on the new credit cards, he must have used her phone to do it. Yet she was trying to spin a story to me that she has been out of the state for the past few months in on the XXXX XXXX. Well, if thats true, how did he gain access to XXXX phone if shes on the XXXX XXXX, which he obviously did! otherwise, he wouldnt have been able to turn on the new credit cards, and she was obviously in cahoots with him. Otherwise how would he have gotten the verification codes that got sent to her phone? 
When I attempted to contact golden Sachs credit card over this issue, and to report this fraud scam, I was unable to talk to anybody because I dont have an account with goldman sachs XXXX and apparently having an account is the only way that you can get transferred to the fraud department. It makes no sense whatsoever. So I am making this report in order to have the chargebacks reversed to my XXXX  account, so I can be made a whole again, since my services were rendered in full, and I deserve payment for said services. 
The charges in question were made on XX/XX/XXXX via XXXX, to XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) in the amount of {$520.00} x XXXX.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","CA","908XX","Older American, Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2023-10-09,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7550891,2023

They made no effort to contact me except for a single voicemail, where they did not leave a return number other than general customer service, and general customer service has no idea how to step into this matter and help me. 

What I now show, is the payment date changed from XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, and interest charges of {$77.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. General customer service says the payment date is wrong, it should be XX/XX/XXXX and shows as such on their end, but they can not explain the additional interest charge or the fact that my account is now accruing interest for the month of XXXX, despite it starting the month out with a {$0.00} balance, paid in full in the previous month. It is my supposition that their """" backdating '' of the payment has created more problems for me than it solved. 

Suffice it to say, my issue is not resolved, and as an aside, I believe Goldman Sachs is lying about the limitation of check payments existing on XXXX 's side. XXXX and my credit union both indicate the limitation is on Goldman 's side and while I can't definitely prove it one way or the other, I'll note that I have no issue paying any other credit card bank via XXXX.

Then, On XX/XX/XXXX the three seperate charges for {$5100.00} were then charged back to my card. So again, I immediately started a chat with Apple to dispute these charges again. But this time, they said that the merchant sent them 'proof ' that I made these transactions. They also provided me with an address and phone number, and suggested I call the merchant myself. That sounded absurd to me to call someone who fraudulently charged my card... isn't this the investigation team 's job at Goldman Sachs?! Apple said they would email me the 'proof ' ( which they still have not done ), and would put this under investigation for another 90 days. But now, I am unable to use {$15000.00} on my credit limit because it's frozen due to this dispute. I am unable to speak with the dispute department, nor able to speak to any sort of supervisor or manager. I was told that XXXX XXXX does not speak to consumers directly, nor does the people that do the actual investigation. 

After I got off the phone with Apple on XX/XX/XXXX, I did some XXXX on with the information they provided to me on the merchant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I found out that it was XXXX. I immediately called in, and was instructed to start a chat and provide my proof of purchase with XXXX in the amount of {$39.00} back on XX/XX/XXXX to Apple. Which I did by providing a screenshot of my purchase. To this date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I still have not heard back from Apple, nor received the alleged proof that they received from the merchant. 

Since then, I have made 5 calls to XXXX, and sent 3 email messages to multiple people in their company, and nobody has returned a call or any message. I have no idea what to do from here.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","CA","92660","","Consent provided","Web",2023-01-23,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6475470,2023

2023-09-16,"Credit card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Other features, terms, or problems","Other problem","CFPB, _VOID WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW_ In Response to Apple Card XXXX Goldman Sachs Bank. , Subsidiary of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , Loan originator regarding original CFPB complaint ID # XXXX First, I would like to advise that Ive received no documents from Apple Card Goldman Sachs Bank. , Subsidiary of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and for proof please provide a certificate of making or a mail carrier tracking # to prove these documents were indeed sent and received by me with a signature. If no certificate of mailing is available, it is to be, notably assumed, that it is because the company is fabricating in order to save face. 

Second, To provide a clear understanding of the violations, I would like to present the following definitions and references : 1. Fixed-Income Securities : As per the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ), fixed-income securities are financial instruments that represent a loan made by an investor to a borrower. These securities include corporate bonds and payment coupons, wherein the bondholder is entitled to periodic interest payments and eventual repayment of the principal amount upon maturity. 

2. Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) : The UCC, adopted by all 50 states in the United States, provides a standardized framework for commercial transactions, including the issuance and trade of fixed-income securities. It promotes fairness, consistency, and consumer protection in such transactions.

3. United States Codes ( U.S.C. ) : The U.S.C. is a compilation of federal laws enacted by the United States Congress. Pertinent sections within Title 15 of the U.S.C. outline regulations and protections related to consumer finance and securities. 

4. Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) : The CFR is a codification of rules and regulations issued by federal agencies. Title 12 of the CFR, specifically, provides guidelines for consumer protection in relation to banking and finance. 

Based on my research and analysis, it has become evident that the aforementioned company has violated consumer rights in the following ways : 1. Profiting off Fixed-Income Securities : The company in question appears to be exploiting fixed-income securities for its own financial gain, potentially to the detriment of bondholders. This exploitation may involve unfair practices, such as exorbitant fees, deceptive marketing, or undisclosed risks associated with the securities.

2. Stripping Consumers of Equitable Interests : By engaging in unfair practices, the company is effectively denying consumers their rightful equitable interests as holders of corporate bonds and payment coupons. This denial undermines the principles of fairness and transparency that should govern such financial transactions.

3. Denying Convertibility of Coupon Bonds : Coupon bonds typically grant bondholders the option to convert their bonds into shares of stock at a predetermined ratio. However, it appears that the company is denying this convertibility feature to its consumers, thereby limiting their ability to exercise their rights and potentially depriving them of potential benefits. 


Per Apple Cards Response to the original complaint : The Bank received a document on XX/XX/2023, including a treasury security note. The Bank does not accept this as a payment method for Apple Card. 


CFPB Please keep in mind, Apple Card speaking on behalf of Goldman Sachs Bank, subsidiary of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is admitting that a form of payment ( a treasury security note ) was indeed sent, received and not accepted as valid, but are also omitting the fact that the form of payment was destroyed and not returned as per the phone conversation I had with the Corporate Secretary of The Chief Financial Officer of Goldman Sachs Bank, subsidiary of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., from the office of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

My rights to remedy are being denied even though Uniform Commercial Code 3-603 tender of payment states : b ) If tender of payment of an obligation to pay an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument and the tender is refused, there is discharge, to the extent of the amount of the tender, of the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse with respect to the obligation to which the tender relates. 

Code of the District of Columbia 28:3604. Discharge by cancellation or renunciation states : ( a ) A person entitled to enforce an instrument, with or without consideration, may discharge the obligation of a party to pay the instrument ( i ) by an intentional voluntary act, such as surrender of the instrument to the party, destruction, mutilation, or cancellation of the instrument, cancellation or striking out of the partys signature, or the addition of words to the instrument indicating discharge, or ( ii ) by agreeing not to sue or otherwise renouncing rights against the party by a signed record.

15 U.S. Code 1666d - Treatment of credit balances states : Whenever a credit balance in excess of {$1.00} is created in connection with a consumer credit transaction through ( 1 ) transmittal of funds to a creditor in excess of the total balance due on an account, ( 2 ) rebates of unearned finance charges or insurance premiums, or ( 3 ) amounts otherwise owed to or held for the benefit of an obligor, the creditor shall ( A ) credit the amount of the credit balance to the consumers account ; ( B ) refund any part of the amount of the remaining credit balance, upon request of the consumer ; and ( C ) make a good faith effort to refund to the consumer by cash, check, or money order any part of the amount of the credit balance remaining in the account for more than six months, except that no further action is required in any case in which the consumers current location is not known by the creditor and can not be traced through the consumers last known address or telephone number.

I have read the Service Agreement for Apple Goldman Sachs Card, and would also like to note that full disclosure was not presented during the initial transaction, nor was the agreement endorsed, to be considered a legally binding contract agreement. Please note that a Terms of Use Agreement is not a contract and that I technically have no financial obligations to Apple Inc or Apple Card as a financial entity. But it is all semantics, a play on words, double speak, for the purpose of defrauding well-meaning consumers. 

With that said ; yet after further review, states no where that Federal Reserve Notes are the only form of acceptable currency. If the instructions sent along with the security were read in its entirety and understood, then the following communications should have been to direct my treasury bond to the appropriate parties for remittance OR return the treasury bond in-tact to the return address and I would then proceed with sending it to the appropriate Trustee address listed on the SEC filings XXXX 

It has come to my understanding that Apple has turned over all its lending responsibilities to Goldman Sachs Bank but it was not clear that The Goldman Sachs Bank, subsidiary of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., was not the Trustee of Apple Inc. Once that was understood, I was expecting the security to be returned but without request for clarity on what was sent, it was already stated to have been destroyed per the Corporate Secretary of the Chief Financial Officer of Goldman Sachs Bank XXXX subsidiary of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Please help me understand why an instrument would be sent to the Corporate Office of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. without good faith and intention to fulfill my duties as the Holder in due course of this payment coupon? 

Also, Please note that if my account is closed, charged off, not placed in a Do Not Collect status, then that IS an adverse action and violates 12 CFR 1026.13 - Billing error resolution ( d ) Rules pending resolution. Until a billing error is resolved under paragraph ( e ) or ( f ) of this section, the following rules apply : ( 1 ) Consumer 's right to withhold disputed amount ; collection action prohibited. The consumer need not pay ( and the creditor may not try to collect ) any portion of any required payment that the consumer believes is related to the disputed amount ( including related finance or other charges ). If the cardholder has enrolled in an automatic payment plan offered by the card issuer and has agreed to pay the credit card indebtedness by periodic deductions from the cardholder 's deposit account, the card issuer shall not deduct any part of the disputed amount or related finance or other charges if a billing error notice is received any time up to 3 business days before the scheduled payment date.

( 2 ) Adverse credit reports prohibited. The creditor or its agent shall not ( directly or indirectly ) make or threaten to make an adverse report to any person about the consumer 's credit standing, or report that an amount or account is delinquent, because the consumer failed to pay the disputed amount or related finance or other charges.

( 3 ) Acceleration of debt and restriction of account prohibited. A creditor shall not accelerate any part of the consumer 's indebtedness or restrict or close a consumer 's account solely because the consumer has exercised in good faith rights provided by this section. A creditor may be subject to the forfeiture penalty under 15 U.S.C. 1666 ( e ) for failure to comply with any of the requirements of this section.

I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau REOPEN this case and forward documents of this to the following Government Agencies, SEC, FTC, FDIC, and launch an investigation against Apple Card, Goldman Sachs Bank., Subsidiary of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , into these violations, ensuring the protection of consumer rights within the fixed-income securities market. It is crucial that appropriate actions are taken to rectify these violations, hold the company accountable, and safeguard the interests of bondholders and consumers at large.

This is in reference to complaint # XXXX Marcus bank stated to you on XX/XX/23 that they were closing the account in question and transferring the funds to the original funding account which was exactly what I wished for them to do. Unfortunately they did not follow through. Instead, on XX/XX/23, over a month later they closed the account and kept the funds!!!!!!!!! Since that time period I have repeatedly called them and have been told multiple lies by their representatives. It is one thing for a bank to lie to me, a XXXX XXXX XXXX male ( financial abuse of the elderly ) but it is a whole other level for them to lie to their regulator, the CFPB. Because XXXXarcus bank lied to you and did not fulfill their obligation when requesting that you close the complaint I am requesting that you re-open the complaint and use your enforcement power to make Marcus bank do the right thing and return the funds as they told you that they would. Now let 's move on to new material. 

The first representative that I spoke to at Marcus after the account was closed confirmed that it was closed but stated that she had no idea where the funds went but she would talk to her manager and have him call me back. He never called back.

The next representative that I spoke to at Marcus bank told me that I need to call XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX the source of the funds, and have them pull the funds back. As ridiculous as that sounds I nonetheless called them and as expected they laughed about it. They suggested that I file a police report and would also investigate on their own. They then mailed me a response, see attached, which stated that because I am authorized to use mom 's checking account, per the same power of attorney that Marcus rejects, it was an authorized transaction on my part sending the funds to Marcus and thus they are closing the case. I then called Marcus bank again to give them one more chance before filing a police report and this time they came up with a new lie to tell me. This time they stated, although admitting to still have the XXXX XXXX account information, that they sent the funds to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I contacted them and they confirmed that this too was a lie, see attached. Next I spoke to a representative at Marcus named XXXX who was kind enough to give me her direct number XXXX and she informed me that if I want the funds back I would now need a court order to do so. I refuse to pay out of my pocket for a lawyer and court costs for this rogue bank to act like a responsible bank should do. 
There is currently a complaint filed with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX investigators name XXXX XXXX XXXX telephone # XXXX pertaining to this matter but as the banks regulator it is up to you to use your powers to have this XXXX XXXX Marcus return the funds. Because they closed the account on XX/XX/23 that also means that they are not paying the interest that would have accrued during all of these months that they have held the funds XXXX if they even know where the money currently is. 

The Federal Reserve Consumer Help Center told me that if you can not rein in Marcus bank 's misdeed that I should forward this complaint to my congressman and senator and provided me links to do so. I would prefer to not go that route and instead end this 8 month ordeal with your assistance. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","FL","XXXXX","Older American","Consent provided","Web",2023-08-03,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7346767,2023

2023-05-04,"Credit card or prepaid card","Store credit card","Problem with a purchase shown on your statement","Overcharged for something you did purchase with the card","This is my third time opening a complaint via CFPB about the same problem : Goldman Sachs Bank continues to claim I owe additional money to them on an XXXX XXXX XXXX. I purchased an XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX in XXXX, XXXX via the XXXX website. I was offered 0 % financing on the XXXX XXXX at a purchase price of {$990.00}. The financing agreement was for XXXX payments at either {$82.00} or {$83.00} with tax. I have already provided Goldman Sachs with records of the payments I made, starting in XXXX, XXXX. I provided them with a list of all the payments I made via my bank in XXXX XXXX, totaling the purchase price of {$990.00}, in an Email dated XX/XX/XXXX. Goldman Sachs has not been forthcoming and has not acted in good faith in attempting to resolve this problem. They contacted my bank without informing or asking me about doing this. In every way, they have acted aggressively rather than in good faith. 

Instead, Goldman Sachs has apparently applied some of my payments on the XXXX XXXX to other items in the XXXX XXXX app. Items like my XXXX storage ( memory ) and XXXX XXXX are deducted directly from my bank account ; so my payments to Goldman Sachs should not be used to pay for such XXXX related expenses. Yet Goldman Sachs continues to harass me, claiming I owe additional money to them. At first their demands were for something like {$64.00}, then grew to {$140.00}, and now Goldman Sachs demands that I pay an additional {$140.00}. Despite having had open complaints filed with CFPB, Goldman has not acted in good faith. Instead, they are reporting me to credit reporting agencies, contacting my bank, and they recently have threatened me with court costs, attorney fees, and billing me for the hourly wages of attorneys or collection agencies fees. 

I am afraid that, even if I pay Goldman Sachs the newest demand, for {$140.00}, they will continue to harass me and fabricate new charges and fees they claim I owe them. They say to contact an Apple Card Specialist, which I have done at least a dozen times. Each time it is like starting from scratch, because the Apple Card Specialists have explained to me that no records are kept of what was discussed or agreed to on the phone calls. I also shall go to my bank to verify that my records from my monthly statements are correct. 

Under threat of legal retaliation, attorney fees, and billing for hourly wages, I feel coerced into paying Goldman Sachs to avoid such punishments for objecting to their outrageous, unprofessional behavior related to this small amount of money. I have never defaulted on a loan or missed payments on a loan for a car or a home ; why would I default on a loan for a computer? Yet I feel blackmailed into paying their demands to avoid owing whatever they may claim I owe. I shall pay the {$140.00} only if Goldman Sachs guarantees that, once I have paid that amount, they will cease and desist adding new charges that I supposedly owe. I shall never again finance an XXXX product or anything else through Goldman Sachs.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NM","87505","","Consent provided","Web",2023-05-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6925078,2023

This notice is for a refund of any security interest I have given you in this contract. 
This notice is a termination of any security interest I have given you in this contract. 

Effective immediately, for past, present, and future, any consent I have knowingly and or unknowingly, whether it be written or unwritten, verbally or nonverbally, given to the following, I hereby rescind ; I hereby rescind all past, present, and future security interest Ive given you in this contract. I am hereby requesting a refund of all security interest I may have given you. I hereby rescind all past, present, and future agreements I made allowing you to report late payments, missed payments, and other defaults of account to my consumer report. I hereby rescind all past, present, and future waivers of my rights. I hereby rescind all past, present, and future assignment. You may not act without my prior consent. I hereby rescind all past, present, and future permission I granted allowing you to make changes to this agreement without my consent. I am the only person who signed for the contract and Im the only person who can make any changes. Its appears that language fraud was used to induce my participation in an unconscionable and inequitable contract.

Making an application for an extension of credit is a way of investing into companies who use short term debt instruments as a way of temporary financing. Owners of book-entry securities are issued statements. The draft attached to my statement is a bill equal to the amount of securities purchased and paid for with my credit. The bill amount is the security my credit purchased. Selling access to my credit makes me the purchaser of the bill. My credit purchased the bill. The draft is guaranteed because the bill has already been purchased, by me, and now the bill must be paid. Im entitled to have my financial assets credited to my securities account.

Ive been trying for months to complete the purchase of securities I purchased on credit with the extension of credit I received from Goldman Sachs in exchange for the investment of my application. The note is the part of the agreement where I promise to pay the amounts billed to me. Since the application is where the agreement is made, the application is the promissory note. My application created the deposit account and holds the purchase money that my application was exchange for. This account and the purchase money therein allows me to purchase more security on credit from the issuer in an amount no greater than the purchase money held on deposit at the time of purchase. Every purchase I make using my account is a deposit with the issuer of the bill. The deposit amount is the security I purchased from the issuer. The cash advance I received for investing my credit, via application, with Goldman Sachs is called purchase money because that money is used to purchase money, or security. Purchase money is used to purchase money. The deposit account, the purchase money in that account, the card used to make purchases, and all bills received from the transactions of that account are financial assets to me. This deposit account is a securities account being held on my behalf with the issuer of the monthly statements I receive. My credit is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Every security is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. I am a trust account customer. My social security account is the account being used to hold my deposit account. The deposit account is a securities account. This is why I can gain access to the transaction history of my deposit account by verifying my social security number over the phone with the issuer of my monthly statements. Goldman Sachs is the issuer of the monthly statements I receive. These statements evidence my ownership of book-entry securities. The due bill is a statement of money owed as when a bank sells a security and receives payment but has not delivered the security or equivalent asset to the purchaser within three business days. Outstanding due bills are considered borrowed funds by a bank issuing a bill and a loan to the holder of the obligation. This paper I received, and am now returning, is considered eligible paper for rediscount at the discount window. This form of paper money, the bill, are the funds you use as payment to borrow and use my credit as collateral for a securities loan. Credit card receivables are bill payments. Your using my financial assets as collateral for a securities loan at the discount window.

I have received the title documents and receipts for goods ( securities ) transported and I now want all of my unredeemed demand drafts, of past present and future, redeemed at face value, exchanged for securities of a new issue, and restricted to my United States Treasury Direct account. This paper money is legal tender that must be securitized to lawful money. Once its stripped and the coupon is restricted to my Treasury Direct Account my bill is considered paid. Whether the statement has a preprinted draft attached or not, this is how I want all bills payable to be paid for every account being held by Goldman Sacs on my behalf. This includes the account associated with my Apple by Goldman Sacs credit card. The Treasury will make the principle payment to the securities account you are holding on my behalf by issuing you the preprinted demand draft as a receipt via wire transfer. The interest rate your normally entitled to is the discount you receive on redemption at par. The XXXX coupon security is a marketable security. When you get the cusip number I want you to trade or sell my security, at your discretion, on secondary market. I know by law you are entitled to receive 20 % at maturity. At maturity I want my 80 % deposited to my Treasury Direct Account.

I continue receiving notice that my bill is payable. Bills payable are your trade obligations that must be accepted. Acceptance is guaranteed because the draft is guaranteed. The draft is guaranteed because the preprinted demand draft is a check payable on sight. Attached to the preprinted demand draft is a receipt of the goods being transported. The goods being transported are the numbers on the bill that represent the security purchased. I know acceptance is completed by delivery or notification and payable on sight. This is not an acceptance this is a demand because the draft is a demand. Consider this my notification.

Consider this my final notification because I have notified you of my concerns thrice before. You and your Indenture Trustee are already in dishonor of your obligations to perform in this matter. Attempting to make me believe my bill payment belongs to you is a deceptive business practice. I received notice that you closed my account. You do not have my permission to close my account. Closing my account is unauthorized. That action was unfair as dictated by reason and practice. Closing my account after I attempted to exercise my rights in good faith is discriminatory. Discrimination in relation to any aspect of a credit transaction is strictly prohibited by law.

Sadly I suspect your dishonor is knowingly and willingly negligent noncompliant. I also suspect you are in collusion with XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX in an attempt defame my character as a result of non payment by intimidating me with negative credit reporting. 

I know you accept Non-Conforming Payments. However I sent you a proper form of payment. Ive attempted to pay my bill several times previously and my Conforming Payments have been refused and remain unreturned. This leads me to think that you took my payment for yourself. I want my account reopened upon receipt of this notice. If my account is not reopened, made current with all payments reporting on time and paid as agreed, I will know your attempt at securities fraud and extortion is purposeful and deliberate. I have all documentation ready and available as evidence to prove my claim if and when necessary.

The term obligation or other security of the United States includes all bonds, certificates of indebtedness, national bank currency , Federal Reserve notes, Federal Reserve bank notes, coupons, United Statesnotes, Treasury notes, gold certificates, silver certificates, fractional notes, certificates of deposit, bills, checks, or drafts for money, drawn by or upon authorized officers of theUnited States, stamps and other representatives of value, of whatever denomination, issued under any Act ofCongress, and canceledUnited Statesstamps.

On page two of the monthly statements I receive I notice a section titled Proper Form of Payments by Mail. Here it says payment should be sent to the address listed on the remittance portion of your Statement. I received this remittance because you, at Goldman Sacs, has a bill that is a due bill.

Bill 1. Bill of exchange 2. Bill of lading 3. Treasury bill 4. Due bill, a statement of money owed as in when a bank sells a security and receives payment but has not delivered the security or equivalent asset. Outstanding due bills are considered borrowed funds by a bank issuing a bill, and a loan by the holder of the obligation. In the securities industry, a bill indicates the amount owed by a buying broker to a selling broker.

Every time I use my credit card associated with this account to make a purchase, what Im actually purchasing is security from the issuer of the bill. This security is delivered to me by way of remittance. I receive a remittance because Im selling you access to my credit. You, the issuer, are buying access to my credit. A remittance is how you deliver me the money owed or equivalent asset whether in cash or cash equivalent. This paper money is cash equivalent.

REMITTANCE 1. Payment toward satisfaction of a debt, whether in cash or cash equivalents, such as checks, drafts, and other negotiable instruments.

2. Payment on an installment loan or open-end credit account, forwarded through the mail to a LOCK BOX, along with a remittance document, a machine readable billing document encoded with the customers account number, and the amount due, plus any late charges, if the loan payment is delinquent.

3. PROCEEDS from a check submitted to another bank for COLLECTION.

I was delivered this remittance from Goldman Sachs as payment towards satisfaction of a debt for not delivering the security purchased at the time of the purchase. This remittance is a cash equivalent that has a bill of exchange attached to it and the bill must be exchanged or redeemed for securities of a new issue. This bill of exchange is a bank draft. I received the remittance because the proceeds from the check attached belong to me. The only way the proceeds can be received by me, in a usable form such as cash, is to send you the bill for payment as promised. The proceeds amount stated on the check is the value of the bill, much like how the number on a federal reserve note indicates the value of that bill.

LOCK BOX Post office box used by organizations to accelerate collection of receivables. Checks are routed a designated po box number, where they are picked up several times during the day, separated from the envelopes, and submitted to the check collection system for conversion into cash receivables. Many large banks offer lock box processing as a cash management service to corporate customers. A lock box can be retail, designed for remittance processing for customer accounts, or wholesale, in which payments from other corporations are collected and submitted through DEPOSITORY TRANSFER CHECK or electronic debit payments into a concentration account.

The address listed on the remittance portion of the statement is a lock box address for credit card receivables. Checks are routed to lock boxes. The remittances I receive are check payments that I am the beneficiary of. When the preprinted demand draft is stripped from the bill of lading, they can be processed as two separate securities. My demand draft needs to be securitized and shall be redeemed on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States. I can not detach the coupon in advance because coupon stripping can only be done by a trust fiduciary.

DEPOSITORY TRANSFER CHECK Preprinted DEMAND DRAFT used by corporations to make transfers of cash from a checking account at one bank to a CONCENTRATION ACCOUNT at another bank. This negotiable instrument requires no signature.

A remittance is a preprinted demand draft called a depository transfer check. When the depository transfer check is submitted to the paying bank, the proceeds will be deposited to the concentration account of the person who issued the bill.

CONCENTRATION ACCOUNT Deposit account into which funds are periodically transferred from various local banks, via wire transfer or automated clearing house debit, from other accounts in the same bank, or in different banks.

A concentration account is also known as a zero-balance account.

ZERO-BALANCE ACCOUNT Checking account used by corporations to accelerate collection of funds from subsidiaries, or control funds disbursed to pay trade creditors. In a zero-balance collection account, collected balances are transferred by DEPOSITORY TRANSFER CHECK or automated clearing house debit from subsidiary accounts into a central CONCENTRATION ACCOUNT, bringing the collecting account to a XXXX balance at the end of each business day. Zero-balance concentration accounts are generally wanting centralized control of cash receipts. In a zero-balance disbursing account, corporate funds are transferred from a master account in an amount sufficient to cover checks presented for payment. Zero-balance disbursement accounts are typically used by companies that want centralized cash control but decentralized funds disbursement. 

My security account, the account your holding on my behalf, is the account with the balance at the beginning of the day. The collecting account with a XXXX balance at the end of the day is also my account. My account has a XXXX balance because an amount sufficient to cover checks presented for payment are transferred from your zero-balance disbursement account to my account. You request that I write my account number as a memo on the check so when you get the check back as a receipt from the payor bank you will know which collecting account to make the disbursement to. My account is collecting the amount transferred from your disbursement account because my check is the check presented for payment. 

The directions also state to enclose a valid check, include name and account number on the check, include payment coupon and no cash permitted. 

COUPON Detachable certificates showing the dollar amount of interest payable to a bond holder at regular intervals, ordinarily semiannually. Coupons on a BEARER BOND are negotiable instruments and are processed just like checks. Bond interest on BOOK-ENTRY securities is credited to the owners account. 

The dollar amount on my coupon is my bond interest. Im the owner of the account collecting the bond interest. When my bond interest is credited to my account, my account will have a XXXX balance at the end of the business day. This coupon is processed just like a check because this coupon is a DEPOSITORY TRANSFER CHECK. My coupon is a preprinted DEMAND DRAFT. The coupon can only be stripped by a trust fiduciary.

DEMAND DRAFT Written order demanding that payment be made, on sight, to a third party. The person writing the draft is called the drawee ; the bank making the payment is the drawer, or the payor bank.The beneficiary of a demand draft, the person receiving the payment, is the payee. Drafts may be payable at some future date ( time drafts ) or on sight ( demand drafts ). Demand drafts drawn on by banks are known as CHECKS.

Since this draft is preprinted, the issuer, Goldman Sachs in this case, is the drawee. The United States Treasury General Account is the checking account used by the Department of U.S. Treasury from which the U.S. government makes all of its payments. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York holds the Treasury General Account and is the drawer, payor bank. I am the beneficiary of the demand draft, the person receiving payment, the payee. I am the payee. My demand draft needs to be securitized and shall be redeemed on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States.

- CHECK Demand draft drawn on by a bank.

This remittance coupon is a check owed to me in payment of bond interest on book-entry securities that must be credited to my account. The coupon is a valid check. This check must be sent for presentment to the United States Treasury for redemption or in exchange for securities of a new issue. Treasury Direct makes principle, interest, and redemption payments, directly to an individual investors account at a financial institution. I am an individual investor with an account at your institution.

PROCEEDS 1. Amount given to a borrower after prepaid interest, loan fees, and other costs are deducted.

2. Funds received from the sale of assets, or from the issue of securities, after deductions of selling or marketing expenses incurred.

3. Sum of money collected on a CHECK or other negotiable instrument after deduction of exchange or collection charges.

The bank sells me a security every time I make a purchase using the card associated with the account. When I dont receive the assets, within 3 business days, the funds for the purchase are considered borrowed, your sale becomes a DUE BILL, and the borrowed funds must be returned to me. The PROCEEDS from the REMITTANCE I receive is payment toward the satisfaction of the money owed to me. The DUE BILL is attached to my REMITTANCE. I promised to pay you the bill. I did not promise to pay you the PROCEEDS from my REMITTANCE. The COUPON is my bond interest on my book-entry securities that must be credited to my account. My REMITTANCE COUPON is a preprinted DEMAND DRAFT called a DEPOSITORY TRANSFER CHECK. The DEPOSITORY TRANSFER CHECK is a DEMAND DRAFT payable on sight. Since I promised to pay you the DUE BILL a trust fiduciary must strip my COUPON and process them as separate securities. The equitable agreement is that I promise to pay you the DUE BILL and you must process my CHECK as a check payment. At redemption the DEPOSITORY TRANSFER CHECK will be deposited and you will receive a receipt, which has actual cash value, for the face amount, deposited via wire transfer into your CONCENTRATION ACCOUNT, for zero-balance disbursement to my account which is the account collecting the balance. When all disbursements are made to collecting accounts, the CONCENTRATION ACCOUNT, and all the collecting accounts will have a zero-balance by the end of that business day. Your PROCEEDS come from the deep discounts you receive at redemption. Separating the corpus, or the bond principle, from the interest COUPON effectively creates a zero-coupon security that can be traded on the secondary market. My PROCEEDS is the sum of money collected on the check I received from the issue of securities. The PROCEEDS from the CHECK is my REMITTANCE. When I receive the PROCEEDS from my REMITTANCE, my financial asset, or its equivalent, is considered delivered. The PROCEEDS from the REMITTANCE is considered income. You, Goldmans Sachs, have been keeping my income for yourself.

- CASH 1. Currency ( including bills and coin ) in circulation, including checking account balances. Cash held by a bank for example VAULT CASH, requires no capital backing under risk-based capital rules adopted by bank regulatory agencies.

2. To convert a check into cash by endorsing and presenting to a bank.

Checking account balances are considered cash. Sending you a check where funds will be debited from my checking account balance is the same as sending you cash and that would constitute payment not received in proper form. The only check I can send you as a Proper Form of Payment by Mail is my remittance check.

ELECTRONIC CHECK PRESENTMENT In check clearing, electronic transmission of the check writers account number and other payment data directly to the paying bank. Electronic check presentment does not eliminate use of paper checks, but it does allow for a more efficient and less costly method for clearing checks. The Check Clearing for the 21st Century ( or Check 21 ) Act permits banks to send a digital image of a paper check instead of the actual check and thus eliminates much of the labor-intensive costs associated with clearing billions of checks Americans write every year.

Due to federal law, known as The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, enabling banks to process paper checks as electronic payments, using a bank service called truncation, where the actual handling of the check is stopped and an electronic check image of the paper check is transmitted to the paying bank. At the paying bank a substitute check is created for check clearing. The actual paper check is held by you and the check is not returned to the check writer with the account statement. I am in receipt of the account statement. I am the check writer with the account statement. Some of the payment data is already preprinted on the check. The other payment data that I add to the preprinted draft such as For Deposit Only makes me the writer and the payee. I promised to pay you the DUE BILL. The DUE BILL is the corpus, or the paper above the perforated line. The corpus also carries the bill of lading with it. The bill of lading are the numbers on the DUE BILL which act as a receipt detailing the security purchase. The receipt is a bill of exchange that can be deposited and exchanged for a treasury bill. The bill is your payment and the remittance is my payment.

SENDING YOU MY REMITTANCE CHECK FOR PAYMENT IS A PROPER FORM OF PAYMENT BY MAIL. I AM ONCE AGAIN PROVIDING YOU WITH A CHECK FOR PAYMENT AND I AUTHORIZE YOU TO EITHER USE INFORMATION FROM MY CHECK TO MAKE A ONE-TIME ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER FROM MY ACCOUNT PROCESS MY PAYMENT AS A CHECK TRANSACTION.

I have been sending you checks and you have not processed any of them. I have been sending you checks, you have refused them all, you closed my account, you not only threaten to report my account, you actually do report and continue to report my account negatively to the consumer reporting agencies. 

I will attach a copy of the most recent bill and check sent for payment.

2023-04-24,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","Installment loan","Getting the loan","","This is a complaint that is being filed against GreenSky , LLC ( NMLS # XXXX ) aka XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

I submitted a loan application together with my wife ( XXXX XXXX ) who is trying to establish her credit as she just came to the U.S. last year. We were verbally declined by GreenSky. On the same date I resubmitted a separate loan application on my own name and was declined by GreenSky. We feel that we were discriminated and do not understand why we were declined with GreenSky but approved by another lender ( XXXX ) on the same day at a higher interest rate and loan payment. Further, when I called GreenSky to understand the specific reasons why I had been declined, no one could tell me specifically why I was declined credit. We also feel that we were caught in a bait and switch scheme. 

Facts : I submitted a joint loan application with my wife to GreenSky on XX/XX/XXXX. We applied for a {$25000.00} loan with GreenSky to finance the acquisition of a new energy efficient air conditioning unit. The XXXX who was to install the unit XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX personally took my application face-to-face and submitted it online to GreenSky on my behalf. XXXX XXXX told us that we were declined by GreenSky. When I ask the XXXX XXXX representative why we were declined, he was unable to tell us. He suggested to submit a new loan application under my own name and so we did. I was decline and again I was not given any specific reason ( s ) as to why I was declinedXXXX XXXX XXXX suggested that we submit my loan application to another lender ( XXXX ). I was hesitant as they had a higher interest rate, loan payment and term but agreed as I had no choice. My family was in potential danger since XXXX XXXX  had determined that the furnace on my A/C unit was cracked and could potentially rupture and start emitting carbon monoxide throughout my house. I was approved with XXXX at an 8.99 % APR, for {$25000.00} for 12 years. GreenSky was offering 5.99 % APR for {$25000.00} amortized over 10 years. 

On XX/XX/XXXX or thereabouts I received a declined letter from GreenSky. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I called GreenSky at XXXX, the phone number on their declined letter. I talked to someone by the name of XXXX who did not have access to my application and was helpless. She insisted that I needed to call XXXX and said they would explain why I was declined. I told her their denial letter specifically stated the following : The reporting agency played no part in our decision and is unable to supply specific reasons why we have denied credit to you. You also have the right to a free She apologized and said she was unable to help me. When I asked for their address where I could send her company a complaint, she said she did not have one and kept insisting that I contact XXXX. After I insisted and insisted and kept insisting that XXXX would not assist as they had not declined me for credit, she asked me for my date of birth and SS #. She then said that someone by the name of XXXX would assist me. When XXXX got online, I asked her title and she said she was a front-line manager. I told her my story and told her that I wanted to know specifically why I was denied because the reasons for denial on their letter were not reasons for denial under the law ( GreenSky reasons for denial were : 1. Number of recent inquiries on credit bureau report.

2. Unable to verify applicants identity.

3. Unable to verify application information ). 

She then told me that the reason I was declined was because my SS # was incorrect, I said how could it be incorrect when you pulled a credit report on me? And, if it was incorrect, then why did you not ask for the correct SS #. ( Subsequent to my call I requested a copy of my credit report from XXXX. Page 13 of the report shows a hard inquiry from GreenSky Installment ). 
She then said that I could re-apply. I said fine. I supposedly got transferred to sales, but instead, I was disconnected ( on purpose it seems to me ). 
I called back again and ended up talking to a customer service representative, someone by the name of XXXX. I told him my story and said that I wanted to file a complaint and he said he would open one a compliance resolution issue. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, someone by the name of XXXX from their customer service department called and said that she would open a compliance solutions case ( # XXXX ) and would notate that the reason of the complaint was an explanation for the reasons of credit denial. I asked her phone number and she gave me XXXX, x XXXX. She said someone from GreenSky would call me back. 
On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX called me back on a recorded line. She apologized and said could not see the reason why I was declined and could not offer any other information. she also mentioned that she could not resubmit my application because it was past 30 days from XX/XX/XXXX. I then asked, if you can not offer help then what is the purpose of your call? She said that it was because a complaint case was opened, and she had to follow up on the case as part of their protocol. 

Conclusion : I believe that under ECOA and Fair Lending laws, Im entitled to know the reasons why I was specifically declined.

I feel that the denial reasons on GreenSkys denial letter are not reasons for denial. As a result of their denial, I ended up with a loan with a much higher interest rate, payment and loan term and feel that this is not fair. Based on my excellent payment history ( XXXX XXXX ), income and assets to support the loan, how can the same applicant with the same credit profile, assets and income can be approved for a {$25000.00} loan at 8.99 % APR, for 12 years, but declined for the same loan amount with a much lower rate and payment ( 5.99 % APR for {$25000.00} amortized over 10 years ). I believe this would be considered discrimination under both Fair Lending and ECOA laws.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","CA","XXXXX","Older American","Consent provided","Web",2023-04-24,"Closed with explanation","No","N/A",6883393,2023

2023-05-02,"Checking or savings account","CD (Certificate of Deposit)","Opening an account","Confusing or missing disclosures","On XX/XX/2023, I went over the money that I had in my Marcus account, which is owned by Goldman Sachs. I had bought a few CD 's through them before, and thought I would check the rates. My savings there is currently getting 3.9 %. I saw the CD rates, and that all of them had rates on the main screen of over 4 %. See my attachment, and it is a screen shot from today ( XX/XX/2023 - all screen shots are from today ) on the first page. 

After looking into the different types, I decided to do the no-penalty CD, and the rate at 4.15 % seemed appealing, especially with the fact that I could cancel it. Yes, it does say after 7 days, but I figured I would have no reason to cancel it unless in the event rates go up, which would be more than 7 days most likely. 

Well, I went through the steps, and funded it by transferring {$20000.00} from my savings at Marcus to the CD. Then I happened to check it online today. Lo and behold, I was bait and switched!!!

It showed I was only getting 0.45 %!!!! Quite a difference, I assumed it was an error, that there was a misplaced decimal point. No, it was correct they said. I then saw that when a person clicks on that first page showing the term of 13 months wit 4.15 %, and then you click Open Account, naturally I assumed that was what I was getting. I figured the one thing I would need to do is put the dollar amount in, which I did. 

HOWEVER, what the sneaky, unethical firm did ( and I have used them for quite some time and had been pleased prior ), is that when the Open Account button is selected, even though the 13 month term and 4.15 % is shown, it then changes the term to 7 month, and to be a ridiculously low rate of 0.45 %. See second page, second screenshot.

Now, had it been a bit lower, even a decent amount lower, I would not be so bent out of shape. For it to be so drastically lower, and lower than any reputable online firm is offering, I feel there is no doubt that this was done purposely and with intent to bait and switch people.

Ok, so bad enough. I figured since I can tell them that I felt misled, and the fact that the money came from Marcus and not transferred form outside, I should have no problem in getting the no-penalty CD cancelled if I at least reached out and told them the issue. See third screenshot, third page. 
First I went through the chat, and was told no. Then the phone, and I escalated to a manager, and told no. Now granted it does say it can't be cancelled within 7 days, but I also feel this is done to get people to simply give up or forget about it, or for them to at least squeeze a week of their lowest rates on their system, even lower than the basic savings rate.

At the least this is poor customer service. And looking at the rate for the high yield CD for 6 months is 4.25 % versus 7 months for the bait and switch CD it defaults from XXXX to XXXX.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NY","117XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-05-02,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6921741,2023

2023-07-02,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem with a purchase shown on your statement","Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement","On XX/XX/XXXX, I was a victim of spoofing where the criminals gained access to my Apple credit card, my Apple account and personal bank account. 

Both my Apple credit card account and bank accounts were immediately closed. I filed online with IdentityTheft.Gov. My Apple account was hijacked. Therefore, I no longer had access to it and had to create a new one. 

After a thorough Goldman Sachs investigation, it was determined that I was not responsible for several fraudulent charges on my Apple Card. For that, I was grateful. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I paid off my Apple Card account with Goldman Sachs. I received a XXXX balance statement. 
Unfortunately, a month later, in XX/XX/XXXX, I received a statement with a balance for the reversal of the Apple Cash rewards on these fraudulent purchases. 

I have tried three separate occasions to dispute the charges since I never received the Apple Cash Rewards, and all disputes ended with, When you make a purchase with your Apple Card you earn Daily Cash. This XXXX XXXX is transferred to your Apple Cash account for you to spend however you want or is accrued and can be applied as a statement credit if you do not have Apple Cash. If you return the purchase, we charge your Apple Card account to reclaim the Daily Cash. This charge is called a Daily Cash Adjustment. Your billing inquiry has been investigated by Goldman Sachs Bank USA and it was determined that no error occurred. As a result, the Daily Cash Adjustment credit provided has been reversed. Very generic and surface level response. Which leads me to believe no one investigated it thoroughly. 

I spoke to 2 Goldman Sachs Supervisors who seemed to understand my frustration, but little was done to rectify the situation. I had to explain myself to multiple call center representatives and the follow through was just horrible. 

For instance, I was transferred to Apple, who is incredible as usual. The rep listened and then transferred me to XXXX XXXX, who manages the Apple Cash. The XXXX XXXX  rep was also amazing and proceeded to tell me I had not earned any Apple Cash as a result of those fraudulent purchases. Then, she got on the phone with Goldman Sachs, the Goldman Sachs rep says he documented my account, but my dispute was again denied! 

My credit rating is wonderful. I have since filed disputes on this card account with all 3 credit bureau agencies. 

I finally sent Goldman Sachs a certified letter with proof I never received any Apple Cash as a result of the XXXX fraud activity. 

I have obtained 2 months statements from XXXX XXXX for both XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. This is something Goldman Sachs dispute department SHOULD HAVE done when I disputed the balance. A simple call and email would have saved Goldman Sachs so much man power time and money. 

Please note, as mentioned so many times before, I was never given Apple Cash for those fraud purchases made on XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore, Goldman Sachs can not ask me to pay them back for something I never received. I just want to be credited to my account for all of the reversed charges and any and all interest and or late fees. I would like an updated statement with a XXXX balance to show I am done with this account for once and for all. The fraud was a nightmare, but so was Goldman Sachs.

During that period, I changed my address and phone number, although continued to make deposits and receive communications from Marcus via the email address on the account. My balance in XXXX reached {$270000.00} plus, so for the first time I tried to withdraw some funds to stay under the FDIC insurance limit. At that point, Marcus froze my account, and I've been trying for weeks to get resolution. Because my old phone number and mailing address don't work, they seem unable to do anything to clear the lock on my account. ( I now live in XXXX, but their system can't deal with a XXXX phone number, and they won't do it through the email, even thought that's the only way they've every communicated with me, including all their required tax docs and notices ). After hours of dealing with Marcus customer service ( using that term loosely ), I asked that they go ahead and close my account and distribute the funds back to my XXXX and XXXX accounts from which I wired funds. They said they could do that, but have been unable to execute ; they keep telling me to call back in 1-2 business days, and I end up with new people who don't know anything and have to start over. I have reached out to every Marcus resource I can find, but I'm getting nowhere - so they're continuing to hold almost {$300000.00} of my funds and giving me absolutely no solution about how to get it.

I actually opened it only to move my Apple cash to this savings account. I was told via text messages that the way to verify my bank account was for me to make a deposit from my primary bank account. 

I made a deposit of {$1200.00} on XX/XX/23. A week later i tried to transfer {$100.00} back to my primary checking and kept getting messages that my account was not verified.

I again reached out to Apple Savings support. They told me it was not yet verified. 

I reached out today, XX/XX/23 and was told for the first time that i needed to call their 800 support number : XXXX. I called and was told i needed to have them call my bank to verify the account number. Verifying via a routing and account number was not acceptable. After sitting on hold for 10 minutes the agent came back online and required me to give my account number or social security number to the bank representative that she had called. I did so only to find out she had called the wrong bank in Pennsylvania and not in my state. They did not track the routing number to the correct bank. So i have now given my account number to people that are not even at my bank. The routing number should alert them to the correct bank. 

The agent then put me back on hold and came back minutes later to tell me she had contacted my bank and they refused to verify my account. I was not allowed to speak with them directly. 

I transferred my funds from my bank account on XX/XX/XXXX. They should be able to transfer the funds back to that same account. All i want is my money back and to close the account. I feel like my money is being held hostage. 

I was transferred to a supervisor, XXXX. She went through a speech that she would verify the transfer process but, i have no resolution. In fact, she transferred me to another """" specialist '' and i had to start the verification calls to the bank all over again. I've been on hold for 10 minutes with no feedback. I was on this call for 45 minutes only for them to AGAIN call the XXXX of Pennsylvania. When i told her we started there at the beginning of this call she hung up on me.

Its my primary credit card. I added my partner to the card as a co-owner years ago. My relationship with my partner is now over and we both agree that she should be removed from the Apple Card. There is no way to do this. The account must be completely closed and if I wish to, I can re-apply for a new card. This creates more than an inconvenience and I argue is an undue burden on the consumer. I am unable to keep the credit I built, I have no guarantee I will receive the same terms when signing back up, and I could even be rejected for a new card, losing my primary line of credit Ive used for years. Closing and re-applying would negatively impact my credit score and would cause me to need to reconfigure recurring payments I make using the card. There is also an attached savings account I would lose that only I can manage ( the account co-owner does not have access ). Given the burden of this process, I should be able to remove the account co-owner without closing the account. In any other realm of finance, a secondary person can be removed from obligation and access - a quitclaim on a house, a title transfer of a vehicle, etc.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","WA","98409","","Consent provided","Web",2023-08-22,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7441182,2023

Marcus locked my account when I initiated this transfer. I called to find out the issue and kept being hung up on. I finally spoke to a supervisor, and they said they would send me an affidavit to verify my identity.

Then the representative said it was notarized by someone in Texas and needed to be done in North Carolina, where I reside. I told her I paid {$25.00} for a virtual video service to get this done. Hence, people work from virtually anywhere to help get documents notarized asap if they can not physically make it to a location. She said they would be sending out another form so it could be done in NC. I then asked to close my account. After all, I am no longer interested in banking with a bank holding my money hostage for over a month, all because I wanted to transfer some of my funds. She said she would send a code to the phone number I have on file to close the account. The code never came, and she asked if I had an alternate number. I told her I only use one number on my account and have not had issues using this number in the past for my account. She put me on hold for another hour and said my account was in review to be closed, but I will need to call back for updates. This has been the worst banking experience I have ever encountered, and I would like to close this account asap.

We had already put a substantial amount down and in payments. Paying her past due bills and our own business bills put a major strain onto us in the business and personally. We were forced to the heartbreakingly close Friday XX/XX/XXXX. 

During that time, the Apple Card payment was late. With the loss of XXXX XXXX and our life savings also meant a loss of income. I was unemployed and actively seeking employment. At times, like many Americans I used my credit card. XX/XX/XXXX, I had a job. I called my creditors to make payment plans. 

Apple Card was owed {$1300.00} of a {$1300.00}. I called and spoke to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I was offered a payment plan to get my account back on track. The offer was to pay XXXX XXXX monthly starting XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX months with 0 % interest. I could always pay more but never less. After XXXX months Apple Card would report the payments to the credit bureaus. If the balance was paid down to zero within XXXX months. I would retain the card and receive my account privileges. The card term would start over, 0 % APR for XXXX months. I asked if I could pay a lump sum to which they replied yes. I paid {$22.00} in XXXX and XXXX. XXXX was {$100.00}. XXXX was {$170.00}. XXXX was {$100.00}. XX/XX/XXXX {$890.00}. My account balance showed XXXX balance. 

XX/XX/XXXX I texted apple regarding my account restoration. An apple Goldman Sams specialist, XXXX said I had a {$40.00} balance. It didnt reflect on my card statements In app. They couldnt explain why I could not see it.

They have received all their money. They report to the credit bureaus every month since my account was positive but have not reinstated account as promised. They never closed the account.

At the very end of XXXX, XXXX, I learned that fraud was being committed on the XXXX XXXX checking account, so I closed the account. Knowing that Apple Card would not get its regularly scheduled payment on XX/XX/XXXX, I called them and told them about the fraud and gave Apple Card the information to """" pull '' payment from a different bank account of mine for the XXXX payment and for all subsequent payments. Apple Card was appreciative the notice, and they successfully obtained a timely {$530.00} payment from XXXX XXXX. I thought all was well until I looked at my XX/XX/XXXX statement. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Apple Card made a """" balance adjustment '' to my Apple Card balance and charged me {$530.00}. The consequence of this charge would be that they were going to charge me a double payment at the end of XXXX ( {$1000.00} ) plus interest. I was alarmed by this and called Apple Card immediately. 

The Apple Card specialists were as mystified by the """" balance adjustment '' as I was. They could see that my XXXXXXXX XXXX payment was cancelled. They could see that my XXXXXXXX XXXX picked up payments timely, so they were not able to explain to me why they had made the {$530.00} """" balance adjustment. '' I disputed the charge and they said they would try to fix it. They extra large payment was deferred temporarily. 

Two weeks later I received an email claiming that the """" balance adjustment '' was correct. This is what the Apple Card email said : """" Your Inquiry has been investigated. You contacted us on XX/XX/XXXX regarding a payment to your Apple Card account. Goldman Sachs Bank USA has investigated your Inquiry and determined that no error occurred. Your payment of {$530.00} was refunded to your bank account ending in XXXX as requested on XX/XX/XXXX. Your bank then returned the payment on XX/XX/XXXX, which increased your outstanding balance by {$530.00}. You can view your payment history, monthly balance, minimum payment due, and payment due date in Wallet by tapping on your Apple Card or by accessing your most recent statement. '' This email is deranged and inexplicable. So I again called Apple Card. After several more phone calls, I learned the following : 1. When I told Apple Card that they would not receive the regularly scheduled payment from my cancelled checking account, Apple Card WITHOUT MY ADVICE, AUTHORIZATION OR CONSENT sent {$530.00} to XXXXXXXX XXXX! They call this the """" refund cycle '' and it is an automated event that they claim they can not control. ( They explained that ordinarily when these """" late '' payment cancelations occur, the money still comes in from the paying bank because it can not be stopped in time, so they refund the money back as a customer service. ) Of course, in my case, NO MONEY WAS EVER SENT from XXXXXXXX XXXX to Apple Card, because I had locked down that account due to fraud and then subsequently closed it entirely. 

2. Because Apple Card was now {$530.00} poorer, by their voluntarily sending {$530.00} off to a closed XXXX XXXX Checking account, they decided to make themselves whole by taking the money from me ( the """" balance adjustment '' ). 

3. I have never received the {$530.00} erroneously send by Apple Card to my defunct and closed XXXX XXXX  checking account. 

4. Apple Card says now that they were """" expecting '' that XXXX XXXX would just """" send the money back '' on their own, but since XXXXXXXX XXXX did not, Apple Card stole ( defrauded, embezzled ) the funds from me via a unilateral """" balance adjustment. '' 5. Losing {$530.00} by Apple Card programming error is bad enough, but then Apple Card unilaterally recovering the lost funds from their customer is even worse. Indeed, it is a crime in my home state of Washington. 

6. Insult on injury, Apple Card has assessed me interest charges on the {$530.00} ; {$8.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and growing. 

Before I complain to the Washington State Attorney General that Apple Card is stealing from me, I thought I might let you ( CFPB ) see if you can get Apple Card to reverse the unauthorized """" balance adjustment. '' They won't even reverse it TEMPORARILY while they try to find the """" lost '' money they sent off into wild, so I expect them to extract {$1000.00} from my XXXX XXXX at the end of this month. ( I should not have to say how burdensome it is to pay an additional {$530.00}. ) My last communication ( the sixth ) with Apple Card was XX/XX/XXXX for nearly an hour. And while the Apple Card Supervisors are all professional and apologetic, they are also completely powerless to help me. And they tell me there is no one """" higher '' that I can complain to at Apple Card or get assistance from. Well, there certainly is : you. 

I have suffered the indignity of multiple hours of lost time ( I am on vacation in XXXX BTW, so this is eating up my vacation fun ) to try and """" stop the steal '' : ) Can you help me?","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","WA","XXXXX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-05-20,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7004959,2023

In addition they asked me for the verbal password which I had never put on because again it was the person that stole my information and opened this account.

They refused to give us contact with the department that could handle closing the account and stated they needed another XXXX business days.

On XXXX XXXX XXXX, I called again and asked to speak to the manager ( XXXX XXXX, and he promised that he would call me back by the end of the day with a resolution. I never received the phone call on that day, and its been almost a week and no one has contacted me. 

Bucking responsibility and forgoing accountability is one thing, but to personally promise a customer that you will take care of the issue and never do so is beyond poor service. I understand that mistakes happen, computer failures occur, and things cant always run as smoothly as planned. However, I dont understand the lack of customer service that I received. I felt disregarded and unvalued, much to my disappointment and consternation. 

Providing the best banking service, or even just plain old good service, instead of the service itself will undoubtedly make a difference. Never forget that todays customers expect and demand to know how their money is handled. Failure to provide answers to a customers questions or inept management that could care less about anything except their inflated egos will only bring loss of business. 

I still haven't received the {$100.00} promotional offer that I was promised, even though I fulfilled all the requirements within the first calendar year of my account opening. This bank is unscrupulous and is manipulating customers through false advertisements, deceptive representations, and omissions. This corporate conduct is illegal and corrupt. An examination of this bank is very much needed.

I added those bank accounts again since my partner was the one who made the initial deposits into Goldman Sachs, but I was given pushback yet again. First, they require me to log in to my XXXX  XXXX XXXX online ID and give them all my bank account information, but then they rejected the link I was attempting to make, taking all my precious information while they were at it.

This is completely unacceptable. They are purposely making it unnecessarily difficult to transfer funds outside of Marcus when they marketed their products as liquid. We keep encountering roadblocks to receiving our money and have been duped into believing that our money was safe and easily accessible. That is not the case. We are requesting a full withdrawal of our funds so we can close our accounts.

I also raised this dispute with Apple Card ( Goldman Sachs ) so that I will not be liable for the amount that I did not authorize.

I believe the fraudster used an Android device to gain access to my XXXX XXXX account through the password which was compromised through other data breaches. Since XXXX XXXX does not require a two-factor authentication and my credit card details were saved and store on my account by XXXX XXXX , the fraudster was able to successfully process the transaction without my authorization.

During the call the agent stated that she setup the arrangement, but when I explained that I saw a credit for over {$2800.00} she replied by saying it would disappear once it was updated in the system. 

On approximately XX/XX/XXXX, I called Goldman Sachs to inquire about a $ XXXX credit on my account. 

I had been attempting to make a payment, but my app stated that no payment was due. I spent close to """" 2 HOURS '' on the phone with Goldman Sachs. The first agent was completely clueless, he was making all sorts of noises on the phone and cold transferred me to another agent. 

She attempted to assist me, but has no idea as to what transpired with my account. I requested to speak with a XXXX, but y XXXX she was communicating with opted to have her relay information to me third party than to assist me themselves. After a little over an hour into the call I was transferred, but the person I spoke with was adamant that """" NOTHING '' could be done for me & stated they once the XXXX payment plan was placed on an account there was no way to reverse it and the payments would be deducted from the credit monthly. I explained that his logic did not make any sense and no other company did that. He basically stated that I could not pay anything towards the remaining balance because o had a payment plan. I asked him to apply the credit towards the XXXX and that was also declined. This angered me because XXXX clearly knew that the agent I spoke with had no clue as to what he was saying because he made no sense. I asked him who was the regulator for Goldman Sachs and he could not answer that either. 

I opted to inquire about the payments because I am assisting my sister who is recovering from her XXXX XXXX within 15 months and her son had senior obligations I have been assisting with because her income is limited. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I received a call at my place of employment. I asked them to call me back in an hour ; however, it was closer to XXXX hours. 

At XXXX an agent called me and I explained that I had returned to work and had a limited time to speak. During that call he mentioned that an error has occurred on my account and explained that he would submit a request to have it resolved. Ironically, the resolution was what I suggested during a XXXX call with customer service the prior week. What is ironic about this is I pleaded to have this matter resolved, but no one listened to me.

This was not only an Unfair practice, it was also Deceptive and Abusive. 

I need it resolved immediately and I would like compensation for the unnecessary time spent on the phone as well as compensation for the negative impact on my credit utilization and score. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received another call stating that my request was still being worked on. I asked her if that was the reason for the call and she replied, yes. I can not make a payment as of XX/XX/XXXX. The balance on my APP is showing a credit of {$2500.00}. It decreases with every purchase. This credit should be applied to my actual balance, but no one seems to know how to rectify this issue.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","MD","21220","","Consent provided","Web",2023-02-02,"Closed with non-monetary relief","Yes","N/A",6514829,2023

The support team then told me they were unable to cancel the payment once it was posted, and I would need to contact my bank to cancel the charge. I contacted my bank, and they said they couldn't cancel it and I would need to go back to Goldman. I went back to Goldman again, and they said they could file a request to refund my payment, and that it would take ten business days. It has now been ten business days and I contacted them again, to which they have said the process will take up to 30 days.

The amount of my money that they currently have on hold is over {$2300.00}. 

I have contacted the company several times via text as they will not give me a phone number, and in every text conversation I am told one silly excuse after another for the reason for the holds. I have heard everything from I made the payment on a weekend to the payment was too large ( {$1000.00} and under ). These seem like ridiculous excuses, and it bothers me when I ask to speak to someone that they say someone will contact me in 10 - 14 days. It is incredibly troubling that I have to wait for a large company like Apple and Goldman-sachs to contact me in 10 -14 days. Also, without knowing when or who is calling me I may not even answer 10 days from now? Then what do I do? It all just seems very silly to me. Something is not right here. 

I also dont understand how I'm expected to pay off a credit card each month when it takes more than two weeks to process a single payment. I would like an answer as to what is going on? Why is this happening all of a sudden? 

I'm very worried that there is more going on in the background, then what they are telling me, which is little to nothing.

2023-01-03,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Other features, terms, or problems","Problem with customer service","Apple Credit Card, which is managed via Golman Sachs, has violated both the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair servicing. In the outline below I will provide details of both circumstances and the conversations ( text conversations ) and over the phone conversations with management. 

Issue # 1 : Servicing Issues First, I obtained the apple credit card in an effort to buy an XXXXXXXX XXXX with no interest. During that period, I made my payments on time. Due to the ease of use, I began utilizing the Apple Credit Card for other purchases and transactions. Over the last few months, and specifically in XXXX, I had to dispute a charge. 

My complaint does not come from the dispute per se, rather, the complaint comes from the events following the resolution of the dispute. During the dispute process, I was not treated in a manner I came to expect from my card company. As a result, I closed the card. I want to make this clear, it was my decision. My payments were not delinquent nor was my card closed due to any issue with Goldman Sachs. I chose to close the card because I felt that the representatives ( which respond via text ) were not truthful, and more certainly knowledgeable, about the issues I was facing as payments were applied. I was unable to balance the card against the transactions from Goldman Sachs. 

As a result of this, I closed the card. This occurred on XX/XX/XXXX. This was after multiple issues within payment postings and processings that were unaccounted for. When I would have text conversations with the card servicer, I was unable to resolve these issues. 

In this particular instance, XXXX was being disputed due to a delivery not being made and I never received the product. I informed Goldman of this and was informed that I would need to file a dispute. I questioned this with representative and I also questioned a {$350.00} attempted charge that I was unable to understand why my card could not be used. It was at that point I realized that there were servicing issues and began deciding to close my card as a result. 

On XX/XX/XXXX there were additional conversations about this dispute and I was becoming more irritated by the lack of knowledge and was informed I could either close the card or file a complaint. I was unsure what a complaint with the company would resolve and I decided to close the card. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I became increasingly concerned about the XXXX XXXX not being resolved, even though XXXX by this point had refunded the money to my account. This left an overage of {$1100.00} to my account. The amount refunded was {$1300.00} and {$560.00} and the original Balance adjustment was {$1900.00}. This should have been a wash. Additionally, a payment of {$3300.00} was made on XX/XX/XXXX which brought the account balance to XXXX. 

IN that time frame ( XXXX and XXXX ), I spent {$2200.00} and made {$2600.00} in payments : These payments were made on the following dates : XX/XX/XXXX : {$3300.00} XX/XX/XXXX : {$920.00} XX/XX/XXXX : {$700.00} XX/XX/XXXX : {$100.00} XX/XX/XXXX : {$650.00} XX/XX/XXXX : {$140.00} This is {$360.00} more than I owed. However, I was informed that when the system processed the dispute, the payments on my original XXXX product were rejected. And somehow I now have a balance due of {$270.00}. 

No one has been able to further explain the discrepancy in the numbers. On top of this, when I inquired about the problem I was told on XX/XX/XXXX that my account was submitted to the collections department and no one could help me at this time. I did, however, request a call back and a supervisor, XXXX called me back. 
I spoke with XXXX who acknowledged the mis-steps in the servicing of my account. He further said that another agent would need to review and call me back. AS of today, XX/XX/XXXX I have missed 2 calls in which the numbers come up as unavailable and I am not able to answer as I have those calls blocked on my phone due to privacy and protection issues. Would you give your information to an unavailable caller? I certainly hope not. 


ECOA Violations On XX/XX/XXXX I inquired about re-applying for an apple card. Yes, as crazy as it seems, I was trying to take advantage of the 0 % financing for a new XXXX product. Remember, my dispute is not with XXXX, it is with Goldman Sachs. I was unable to find anyone with a similar financing option as apples plan. 
In my text with XXXX at XXXX, I asked if I could APPLY for a new credit line. I was informed that : in order to reapply for an Apple Credit Card, then the balance would need to be paid off first. I asked So youre saying I am unable to apply? XXXX responded That is correct XXXX. Before reapplying, the account that was closed will need to have no pending transactions, no unposted interest and a balance of XXXX. Before these criteria are met, you will not see an option to reapply in your wallet. I advised that this is a direct violation of the ECOA and was disconnected ( without my consent ) from the chat box. I quickly responded and XXXX then said a supervisor would need to review my complaint. At that point, XXXX advised that another representative would need to look at my account. Again, Im not asking for the account to be reopened. I was simply asking for the ability to apply. 
As of today, there has been no resolution and I am still out money. The records say I owe an additional {$270.00} and no one has been able to show me where this discrepancy exists. 

I am glad to provide all chat documentation.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NC","275XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-01-25,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6391501,2023

2023-03-21,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Managing an account","Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed","The following complaint is regarding an error made by Marcus by Goldman Sachs when I initiated an ACH transfer of funds from my Marcus savings account to an external bank. As a result of Marcus ' error, disorganized customer service, and lack of response, I have incurred monetary losses.

I initiated a transfer of funds in the amount of {$1000.00} from my Marcus savings account to an external bank linked to my online account with Marcus. The transaction posted on XX/XX/2023. Over the next couple of days each time I logged into my Marcus account, the information provided showed the transfer had been initiated and the funds had been withdrawn from my Marcus account On the third day, I checked both accounts and saw the funds had not been deposited into my external bank account as promised by Marcus.

I called the customer service team and spoke with an agent who told me the transfer had been canceled. I requested an explanation and told him that the online information on my account verified the transfer was in progress. He became nervous and hung up. I called back and repeated my story to another agent who provided conflicting and false information. She said the transfer was not canceled and the funds were withdrawn from my Marcus account and shoiuld have been received I called the other bank and repeated the story to the agent who transferred my call to her manager for help. I repeated the story to the manager and she said there was no record of a recent transfer from Marcus. I called Marcus again and spoke with a manager. I repeated the story and when the manager viewed the notes related to the transfer, he said the notes were confusing. He said he had never seen this type of error before. He said the transfer had been canceled by Marcus but he didn't know why it was canceled. He admitted it was Marcus '' error and offered to have the funds wired into my external bank account. However, by this time five hours had elapsed from my first call to Marcus and the funds could not be wired the same day. The manager said he would have the customer care team research this matter and contact me within 10 business days. When the customer care associate contacted me, they left a voicemail instructing me to call Marcus ' general customer service number and said anyone could help. I returned the call and spoke with an agent who could onlly address general questions. She informed me that the customer care team determined the transfer was canceled due to confusion. That was the entire explanation. No details about why they were confused. When I spoke with her supervisor and requested monetary relief, she implied the error was caused by me but did not provide an explanation.
I was told a resolution team member from Marcus would investigate my complaint and contact me within two business days. It's been three weeks and nobody from the resolution team has called.

Clearly, this was not my mistake. I never canceled the transfer, I had sufficient funds to cover the withdrawal and the accounts were linked.

I '' m requesting monetary relief for losses accrued due to Marcus ' error canceling my transfer of funds without my authorization, not notifying me of the canceled transfer, and providing false and conflicting information regarding the tranfer 's status. As a result, I was on the phone for 5.5 hours back and forth between both banks.

Im also requesting that Marcus ' team provide me with all the documents used to resolve this complaint.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","CA","90274","","Consent provided","Web",2023-03-22,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",6726252,2023

The phone was stollen. I called my Apple Card customer service number at XXXX and explained what happened. I asked for the card to be closed to avoid any charges from being made on my card. I asked for the balance on the card to be transferred over to a new account under my name so I can pay off the balance. I was informed that the only way I can process payments is by 1 ) giving the customer service representative my card information over the phone so they can process the payments 2 ) sending payment to a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, PA XXXX ). I did not think that was safe and the exchange seemed fraudulent. 3 ) Login to the account and pay through there. I was at the time unable to login to the account because OTP code was being sent to the stollen phone. I called Apple and resolved the matter and was eventually able to regain access to my account. Once I had access, I logged in and paid off the balance. There was a pending payment, I tried o log in after a period of time to confirm the payment processed through and instead found I could not log in and was asked to call the number above. I called the number. The customer service person I spoke to said they could not see anything on my account regarding the lock and transferred me over to Apple services. Apple noted they could not see the lock on my account and that it has to be an issue on Goldman Sachs end and transferred me back. After 4 hours on the phone, I was informed that the reason I could not log into my account is because I had paid off the balance and therefor the account is unavailable for me to login to. I was informed that there is an installment on my account and asked to payoff the installment amount. I issued verbal consent for the card on record to be used to payoff the installment balance on request. After I was informed that my account has been paid off ( the balance on the card is XXXX ) and closed. I was sent an email stating as much. A week later, I tried to log into the account on a whim and was able to successfully log into the account - which I was previously informed was unavailable for me to log into because the account is closed and the balance paid off in full. When I logged in, I discovered a new balance, even though the card had been paid off and the account closed months prior. I paid off the amount, called the customer service number above to try and get an explanation about what was going on. Since I've been paying off the card for months only to have """" new '' charges appear even though the card has been closed and I had informed customer service that the phone linked to the card had been stollen. The agent I spoke to informed me that the balance showing up on their end was significantly less than the balance that I was shown- and paid again. I asked how that was possible and she noted she did not know and would look into it. I asked to speak to a manager. I was transferred to a manager who asked for my first name, last name, birth date, and phone number linked to the card ( prior agents asked for the last 4 digits of my social as well ). After some time on the phone, the manager informed me that they would open an internal investigation into the matter since I had been informed that the card was paid off the installment linked on the card had been paid off and my bank account statements show the transactions withdrawn from my card for the referenced charges but the charges somehow remained on my account in their systems. I asked the manager to explain why is it that I was charged - can verify the withdrawals occurred in my bank account - and yet somehow the payments were not applied to my credit card balance/installments? I asked where were the payments I was charged for processed? She did not provide an answer and instead told me an internal investigation will be opened on the matter.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","MA","02121","","Consent provided","Web",2023-03-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6649315,2023

I tried to close the account again and make the payment and was assured it was closed. After a few more calls/weeks with the same story, I found out my account wasn't even closed and I was being charged a hefty level of interest on this.

About a month later, I finally received confirmation the account was closed. When it came time for payment, I wanted to get the interest reduced. XXXX through the phone call, the representative hangs up on me. When I call back they were struggling to find my case and said they would reach back out.

2023-02-01,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Managing an account","Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed","Marcus XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX offers a referral promotion where, upon the successful referral of a new customer, both the referrer ( original account owner ) and the referee ( new account owner ) receive an interest rate increase of XXXX percent for a period of XXXX months. Referrers are instructed to share their unique referral code with the referee, and the referee must use that link to open an account, in order for the promotional bonus to activate. This program is called Marcus Referred. 

I referred a new customer in early XX/XX/2023, who used my referral code to open a new account. The promotional bonus has not been applied to our accounts, and after multple attempts to solve the issue via chat and phone, Marcus has not adequately resolved this issue. My complaint is as follows : 1. Marcus exhibited duplicitous behavior. Despite no error on my part, nor on the part of the referee, and despite following their procedure, the promotional savings is being unfairly withheld. 
a. I contacted Marcus after a week of not seeing the bonus applied to my account. I was told to have my friend get in touch with them, which she did. ( Chat, XX/XX/2023. ) b. She was then told to send them my link, which was now coming up with the message, There seems to be an error with the referral link. She was told to have me get in touch with them again, and that theyre documenting it. ( Chat, XX/XX/2023. ) c. I contacted again, and was told to have my friend get in touch with them, which she didagain. ( Chat, XX/XX/2023. ) d. Via a phone call, she provided my unique code. She was told there was an error with the referral link, and that I should get in touch with an agent to have it checked out. Again and again, we heard this, repetitively punting the issue from referrer to referee. ( Calls, XX/XX/2023. ) e. After I placed two more phone calls with Marcus , I was provided the same runaround, finally being told that there is, indeed, an error with my link, and they will not fix it. ( Phone calls with agents XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, XX/XX/2023. ) Therefore, due to this technical issue beyond my control, my promotional bonus is being withheld. I have made every effort to provide evidence that the referee and I followed their protocol exactly. That they acknowledge not only these efforts but also the technical issuebut will not provide the bonusis knowingly deceitful. 

XXXX. Marcus offered me unequal and inadequate resolution moving forward, offering me no guarantee that the Referred program will work for me at any point in the future. During my XX/XX/XXXX call with supervisor XXXX, after they acknowledged there was an issue with my link and that it would not be fixed, I was offered the following procedure to follow for the Referred program : a. When a referee opens an account, they are to call customer service as soon as possible to speak to someone to see if they can have my code applied. 
b. When a referee opens an account, I am also supposed to call as soon as possible to try to link the accounts. 
c. However, I was told they can not guarantee this will work, despite the documented issue. 

Therefore, not only do they offer a more complicated route to obtain the bonus on the part of both the referrer and the referee, they are also unwilling to guarantee the promotion can be applied. This is an unfair and discriminatory alternative. 

In summary : Due to a technical error with either my code, link, or account, I am being denied the promotional bonus. Furthermore, the alternative approach they offered is not guaranteed and is therefore inequivalent. Marcus has knowingly denied me the promotion, and has offered me an inadequate and unfair alternative.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","PA","19027","","Consent provided","Web",2023-02-01,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6516810,2023

She and I care for our Father who is of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), whose health is compromised, and who suffers from XXXX XXXX Our Father is a XXXX XXXX  so, for his safety, my sister and I decided that a bathtub to shower renovation needed to be done immediately! We contacted several companies that advertise shower renovations completed in as little as one day. In the late afternoon of XX/XX/2023, a sales representative from a bath renovation company visited us at our home. He took us through a very lengthy and tiresome 2 1/2-hour presentation during which time he asked what was most important to us regarding the renovation. Naturally, price was important. My sister and I didnt care about the aesthetic appeal of the new shower, nor were we the least bit interested in any increased resale value the new shower might add to our home. We told the representative that the renovation was intended for our XXXX XXXX Father and that due to his age and special needs, the speed of completing the renovation was paramount. My sister and I insisted on a start date of no later than 4 weeks. The sales rep countered with a start date of 12 weeks. For the sake of our Fathers safety my sister and I held on to the urgency of starting the job NO LATER THAN 4 WEEKS or there was no sense in continuing with the presentation. The representative asked us to wait a second while he made a phone call to his project supervisor. Afterwards, he gave us the great news that our project would be completed within our requested time limit of 4 weeks. My sister and I decided on a shower design and accessories and negotiated a final price for the project. Three more times during the negotiation, my sister and I asked for and were reassured by the representative that our project would begin NO LATER THAN 4 WEEKS FROM THAT DAY! We felt that the final price was ridiculously high. Since our father is an XXXX XXXX XXXX and the sales representative gave his solemn promise of a 4-week start date, only then did my sister and I agree to go through with the sale. We told the representative that we had an excellent relationship with our credit union and would obtain a 3-year, low interest loan. The salesperson told us he was also an authorized third-party representative of GreenSky and started pushing the benefits of 15-year financing through GreenSky instead of getting a credit union loan. The representative boasted that his clout with GreenSky enabled him to get practically ANYONE financed through GreenSky as long as they have an XXXX XXXX credit score over XXXX. My sister and I sensed the XXXX and ageist overtones in his statement given that our hair is gray, our skin is XXXX, we live in a city thats 91 % Non-White, and with a 33.1 % poverty level which is 159 % higher than the U.S. average, and in a neighborhood mostly comprised of abandoned properties and dilapidated buildings. I assured the representative that my sister and I wouldnt have a problem getting a loan at our credit union. I showed him proof of my near perfect XXXX XXXX XXXX score of XXXX and my sister 's XXXX XXXX score of XXXX ( Please see attached documents A & B ). In his effort to control every aspect of the sale, and to get our signatures on the dotted line right then and there, he said that if we didn't complete the deal that night ( the sale and the financing ), it would make it necessary for him to come back a second time and we would lose the {$1000.00} discount he'd given us. Additionally, he said wed lose the project start date of 4-weeks from that day as hed guaranteed. My sister and I were exhausted, and our father had gone unfed and hygienically unattended to for the entire time the sales representative had been in our home. We surrendered and gave him our personal information. He also said that he needed a {$1000.00} deposit on our credit card which we gave him AFTER he assured us again that there absolutely wouldnt be a problem for our project to begin no later than 4 weeks from that day ( which would have been by XX/XX/XXXX ). The remaining balance for our project was {$16000.00} ( Please see enclosed document # 1 ). The representative told us that GreenSky had approved us for up to {$20000.00}, so why was it still necessary for us to put {$1000.00} on our credit card?? On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a call from the bath renovation company project coordinator to verify the shower style and accessories my sister and I decided upon. We were again reassured of a 4-week start project start date. On or about XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX weeks from the sale date, we received a billing statement from GreenSky showing that a transaction was charged to our account on XX/XX/2023 ( which was the same date that the sales rep came to our home ), in the amount of {$7500.00}, and demanding that a payment be made in the amount of {$72.00} ( of which {$41.00} was accrued interest ). According to the statement the payment was due no later than XX/XX/2023 ( Please see attached documents # 2 & 2a ). Up to that point my sister and I were {$8500.00} in debt and with nothing to show for it. This was beyond the pale. Not only had our project not been started during that time period as promised by the sales rep, we also hadnt heard from anyone at the bath renovation company since the XX/XX/XXXX follow-up call from our project manager. My sister and I feared that if we made the {$72.00} payment, we'd be locked into the entirety of GreenSky 's contract even though the service we expected hadnt been performed. What was equally worrisome was that even though we hadn't received the service we were promised, if we didn't make the payment to GreenSky by the XXXX XXXX due date, our stellar credit scores that my sister and I had built and nurtured for decades would plummet drastically! We weren't about to be pressured into paying for a service that we were promised but hadn't received. On XX/XX/XXXX we called both GreenSky and the bath renovation company to express our extreme dissatisfaction with the circumstances which lead up to the sale. We first spoke to a GreenSky CSR named XXXX who advised us that an advocate would contact us by Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XXXX  An Executive Vice President from the bath renovation company reached out to us later in the morning of XX/XX/XXXX. We told the EVP about the promise of a 4-week project start date the sales representative gave us on XX/XX/XXXX. The EVP was forthright, and his honesty was very refreshing. He said that the representative should NEVER have made us that promise because all of the company 's representatives were made aware of the severe backlog his company was experiencing in getting material, that there were SEVERAL other projects ahead of ours that were held up for months because of that, and with no reasonable estimate of when those projects ahead of ours would be started. The bath renovation company EVP apologized sincerely for the representative 's misrepresentation of the companys ability to deliver on his promise and the inconvenience it caused us. The EVP offered to rescind our contract with his company and to cancel our entire loan with GreenSky as well. The EVP refunded to GreenSky the {$7500.00} that GreenSky advanced to his company on XX/XX/XXXX. Let us be clear. My sister and I have no problem with the bath renovation company and hold the company harmless. The bath renovation company EVP apparently rescinded our contract due to breach of contract in that the EVP knew that his company could not complete or follow its responsibilities as outlined and promised in the contract by the sales representative. The EVP also refunded my sister and I the {$1000.00} deposit that was charged to our credit card, thereby making my sister and I whole with respect to our contract with his company. On XX/XX/XXXX, we received two emails from GreenSky. The first one assigned a reference number to our case ( Please see attached document # XXXX ), and the subsequent email indicated that the entire GreenSky loan balance of {$7500.00} had been canceled ( Please see attached document # 4 ). 
Additional documentation from GreenSky dated XX/XX/2023, and XX/XX/2023, further confirm that the loan was canceled ( Please see attached documents # 5 & # 5a ). 
Subsequent communications with GreenSky detailed our wish to have the GreenSky tradeline removed from all 3 of our major credit reports and the corresponding GreenSky inquiry removed from our XXXX credit report, which was updated on XX/XX/2023 ( Please see attached document # 6 ). We felt this to be a more than reasonable request given the deceptive way the inquiry was obtained. We've spoken to GreenSky CSR Department numerous times since but were repeatedly denied our request to have the inquiry removed. Although those CSRs were cordial and very empathic to our situation, they said that they didnt have the ability to remove GreenSkys inquiry. Finally, I asked to speak with a GreenSky manager and was contacted by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2023, at XXXX XXXX  XXXX. After identifying myself and advising her that my sister was also on the phone, she advised us that call was being recorded and invited me to go ahead or start talking. I asked if she had taken time to familiarize herself with our case number and particular concern. Thank God, the call was recorded. XXXX XXXX proved to be argumentative, evasive, condescending, dishonest, and accusatory. I tried to establish a dialogue with XXXX XXXX by asking her a question where the obvious answer was yes, thus setting the stage for her, my sister and I to have an open, sincere, and fair discussion there-on. Instead, XXXX XXXX chose to sidestep my question and engaged in the act of blaming my sister and I for the situation the authorized GreenSky third-party representative had put us in and refused to remove the inquiries from our XXXX credit reports. XXXX XXXX displayed a contemptuous attitude toward my sister and me. I told her that there was no need for my sister and I to try to reason with her in that she made it glaringly obvious that she had predetermined NOT to consider ANYTHING my sister and I had to say. My sister and I fell victim to an unfair and deceptive sales tactic by an authorized GreenSky third-party representative. Yet, XXXX XXXX declared that WE actively sought credit with GreenSky. XXXX XXXX further stated that we willingly signed the application for credit. Although GreenSky closed our account and willingly expunged its tradeline from our credit reports, the inquiry will remain on our XXXX credit reports. One can analogize our experience with GreenSkys authorized third-party representative to that of a woman who's pursued by an over-zealous man to go on a date with him. The woman has misgivings and expresses her concerns to the man. Still, the man continues in his pursuit of her, telling the woman that shes missing out on the time of her life. The man swears that hes a nice guy, promising the woman that she has nothing to worry about and that she'll be treated with nothing but utmost respect. Finally, and still with some caution, the woman gives in to the mans determination and agrees to go on a date with him. Unfortunately for the woman, the man turns out not to be the nice guy he swore to be and assaults the woman at the end of their date. The woman reports the assault to whom she believes to be the proper authorities. Instead of arresting the man, the authorities chastise the woman for filing a complaint. The woman is also blamed for instigating the incident because she agreed to date the man in the first place. The authorities therefore deemed the incident as mutual consent between both parties and NOT an act of assault on the mans part. The womans allegation of assault was dismissed by the authorities, leaving her to suffer humiliation and damage to her reputation. This is the dilemma plaguing my sister and me ( the woman ), brought on by GreenSkys authorized third-party representative ( the man ), GreenSky and XXXX XXXX ( the proper authorities ), and GreenSkys inquiry ( the date and ensuing damage to our reputation. )","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","IN","XXXXX","Older American","Consent provided","Web",2023-09-11,"Closed with non-monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7532395,2023

2023-10-10,"Credit card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Trouble using your card","Can't use card to make purchases","On or around the early hours of Saturday, XX/XX/2023, I lost my wallet on the way home from meeting a friend for dinner. Upon the realization I no longer had access to my wallet, which contained my ID as well as XXXX personal credit cards and a XXXX bank debit card, I immediately began to mitigate any potential concerns over someone else having unauthorized access to those cards by calling the issuers for each of those companies to report that the physical card was lost. One such company I reached out to was GM Card by Marcus, a Goldman Sachs company. 

The agent on the phone was courteous and empathetic to my situation and took the necessary steps to close out my physical card and send out a new card. However, within that same call, I asked about whether the virtual card on my account would be updated and viable to use while prior to waiting for my replacement card to arrive via snail mail. The agent answered in the affirmative that I would be able to utilize the virtual card immediately. In fact, I even verified that the numbers on the virtual card had updated, so presumably the new virtual account was established prior to me trying to use it. With the assistance of the agent, the virtual card was added to my XXXX XXXX, and I proceeded to try to use it at a merchant approximately XXXX minutes later. That charge was declined twice. The amount was for approximately {$38.00} and at the time of the charge, I had over {$2700.00} in funds available on my credit line.

Given that I checked the available line of credit and was assured by the GM Card agent that the virtual card would work, I called them back to understand what the problem was. This started a series of confusing conversations with multiple agents. Each time I called and spoke with a GM Card agent, they instructed they would need to do a One-Time Pin ( OTP ) authorization where they would validate that the virtual card was being utilized by the authorized user. Each time, I provided the OTP code I received via text message, ( which was only accessible from my own facial biometrics on my XXXX ), and provided that OTP code to the agent on the phone ; and each time I provided that code, I was instructed to wait approximately XXXX minutes and the card should be available for use. 

The scenario above happened multiple times through out the weekend. At times, the card would work and at other times it would not work. There was really no rhyme or reason because often times, I only used the card with the same merchant ( e.g., XXXX ). At no point, was I aware that there was an account restriction until I had to follow-up with the issuer on Sunday, XX/XX/2023. By this time, I had spoken to multiple agents in a XXXX period of time. No one could answer or even eluded to the account being restricted. In total, we did the XXXX verification four separate times. It was only when I demanded to speak to a supervisor to dig into this issue further, the agent indicated that the account was restricted and had to be reviewed by """" upper-level management. '' I told the agents that the account being """" under review, '' when it was the only card I had available to pay for groceries/local travel/etc. was super generic and not helpful. That the process of having to validate my authenticity four times was not only unfair, but highly-deceptive as I reasonably relied upon GM 's explicit representations that this verification process would resolve the issue. The issue was not resolved and as of XXXX XXXX on Tuesday, XX/XX/2023. I still do not have access to the available credit line, nor have I received a follow-up call from a representative of """" upper-level management '' who could advise me why the account is under review/restricted.

To be fair, this card is not normally used by me. I am a a risk-compliance professional myself and I understand the need to have controls in place to verify that the inconsistent usage pattern on a credit card is by the authorized user and not a fraudulent party. However, what is the purpose of having an OTP validation process, if the issuer is still going to restrict the authorized user from utilizing their funds? This was a question I asked to representatives, but of course they were not able to veer of script to answer that question. As a matter of fact, the GM Card agent I spoke to on Monday, XX/XX/2023, agreed with me that it did not make sense to her either. 

So within the past XXXX or XXXX days, I have had several phone calls with GM Card agents, validated my identity via the OTP process on four separate occasions, have attempted to resolve this issue through my own personal knowledge and experience as a risk-compliance professional, and have unsuccessfully been able to resolve this issue with the card issuer.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","DC","20011","","Consent provided","Web",2023-10-17,"Closed with non-monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7675010,2023

My troubles started after buying a new XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' w/touch bar in XX/XX/XXXX. 

I made my first-ever call to Apple Support at the end of XX/XX/XXXX and had to continue calling more and more as I was implementing the troubleshooting instructions from the Apple senior tech experts. The Apple tech employees were all telling me, and I quote, """" XXXX XXXX, I have never seen anything like this, so my conclusion is you have bad XXXX data, '' I was then instructed by several different Apple Senior Technicians experts to delete my current Apple ID and all its content and create a brand new one with a brand new password, fresh start. And, of course, we will not be recovering or restoring from any backup. I was readily willing to lose all of my data to get out of this rabbit hole I had been sent down. So that's what we did """" 6 TIMES ' IN within XXXX XXXX. I would have a story of XXXX apple Id attempts, but I refused to do the same troubleshooting techniques over and over again, expecting a different result, but they certainly were. Long story short, I declined the last two Apple employees that were only willing to continue helping me if I deleted and started over again. I couldn't believe how rude and admit that they were to me. 

During this process, Apple 's tech employees managed to single handily destroy my XXXX excellent credit rating in 120 days. When I found out about this through a letter from Goldmann Sachs, I called Apple immediately, not even worried a bit because I knew Apple would quickly see that their senior technician made a mistake when giving full detailed instructions to me. I know he didn't do it on purpose, and he apologized several times over because he is only human and forgot to tell me some crucial steps before deleting my Apple Id. It's really appalling how clearly simple this one is. Apple got my Goldman Sachs Apple card """" Closed By Creditor '' with no reason given because they had none. I have proof that my account was in perfect standing, and the first payment wasn't even due yet. I had only had the card for 3 months and used it one time at brunch for {$24.00} dollars ; with a credit limit of {$15000.00}. 
I was doing nothing more than following the directions from a qualified Apple senior tech employee. That one incident, of course, was reported to the three major credit bureaus, which raised a huge red flag in the system and caused all of my creditors to panic. Well, to say the least, the ripple effect from that literally took my credit score from XXXX to XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX credit limit was {$21000.00}. They automatically lowered it to {$6000.00}. I had only used {$5800.00} out of my {$21000.00} available. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX credit limit was {$30000.00}. They auto-lowered me to {$10000.00} *XXXX  XXXX was {$2100.00} Auto-Lowered to XXXX ect Goldmann Sachs Has already admitted it was a huge mistake, they sent me a check for {$250.00} dollars LOL, and offered my card back with same credit line","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","MO","63028","","Consent provided","Web",2023-01-30,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",6505474,2023

What's helping Low revolving credit usage You've limited the use of your available revolving credit. 

Ratio of your revolving balances to your credit limits : 3 % For XXXX High Achievers, the average ratio of the revolving account balances to credit limits is less than 7 %. 

XXXX Scores evaluate the total revolving account balances in relation to the total credit limits on those accounts. People who keep their ratio of balances to credit limits low pose less risk to lenders than those with higher ratios. 

Long credit history You have an established credit history. 

Your oldest account was opened : 22 Years, 4 Months ago XXXX High Achievers opened their oldest account 25 years ago, on average. 

Average age of your accounts : 12 Years, 1 Month Most XXXX High Achievers have an average age of accounts of 9 years or more. 

XXXX Scores measure the age of the oldest account and the average age of all accounts being reported. Generally speaking, having a relatively long credit history and not opening many new accounts is reflective of lower risk. 

What's hurting Serious delinquency You have a serious delinquency ( 60 days past due or greater ) or derogatory indicator on your credit report. 

Number of your accounts that were ever 60 days late or worse or have a derogatory indicator : 1 account Virtually no XXXX High Achievers have a 60 days late payment or worse listed on their credit report. 

The presence of a serious delinquency or derogatory indicator is a highly correlated predictor of future payment risk. People with previous late payments are more likely to pay late in the future. As these items age, they will have less impact on the XXXX Score. Most late payments stay on your report for no more than seven years. 

Recent missed payment You recently missed a payment or had a derogatory indicator reported on your credit report. 

Your most recent missed payment happened : 1 Month ago About 98 % of XXXX High Achievers have no missed payments at all. But of those who do, the missed payment happened nearly 4 years ago, on average. 

The presence of missed or late payments or derogatory indicators on a credit report, including the number of missed payments, how late they were and how recently they occurred, are correlated with future credit risk. Generally speaking, people who consistently pay their bills on time are less risky compared to people with recently missed payments. As missed payments age, they have less impact on a XXXX Score. 

Lack of recent non-mortgage loan information You have a lack of recent activity from a non-mortgage installment loan. 

Your credit report shows a {$0.00} balance on your non-mortgage loans ( such as auto or student loans ) or a lack of sufficient recent information about your loans. Having a non-mortgage installment loan with no missed payments and a low balance along with other types of credit demonstrates that a person is able to manage a variety of credit types. Having a 0 % installment loan balance to loan amount ratio is considered slightly more risky than having a low installment loan ratio. 

Few accounts paid on time You have an insufficient number of accounts that are currently paid as agreed. 

Number of your accounts currently being paid as agreed : 7 accounts XXXX High Achievers have an average of 6 accounts currently being paid as agreed. 

The XXXX Score considers the number of accounts showing on time payments. Generally, the higher the number reported the lower the risk. Compared to other people with a similar age of credit history, the number of accounts you have that are currently paid as agreed is low. 

Prepared For XXXX XXXX XXXX generated : XX/XX/XXXX Disclaimer About your XXXX Score XXXX or other XXXX Scores Your XXXX Score XXXX powered by XXXX XXXX is formulated using the information in your credit file at the time it is requested. Many but not all lenders use XXXX Score XXXX. In addition to the XXXX Score XXXX, we may offer and provide other base or industry-specific XXXX Scores ( such as XXXX Auto Scores and XXXX Bankcard Scores ). The other XXXX Scores made available are calculated from versions of the base and industry-specific XXXX Score models. 

Base XXXX Scores ( including the XXXX Score XXXX ) range from XXXX to XXXX. Industry-specific XXXX Scores range from XXXX. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower XXXX Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk. There are many scoring models used in the marketplace. The type of score used, and its associated risk levels, may vary from lender to lender. But regardless of what scoring model is used, they all have one purpose : to summarize your creditworthiness. Keep in mind that your score is just one factor used in the application process. Other factors, such as your annual salary and length of employment, may also be considered by lenders when you apply for a loan.

2023-07-26,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","Domestic (US) money transfer","Other service problem","","I linked a new external bank account with my Marcus Online Savings account in order to do a transfer ( or Wire ). My external bank account was opened with XXXX XXXX over the weekend and I was attempting to fund it with a portion of the available balance in my Marcus account. I scheduled a wire at XXXX XXXX est on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX and the money did not go. I called back in at XXXX and Marcus told me the reason they did not send it is because they couldn't verify that the receiving account had my name listed as one of the owners, despite it being linked. They stated that they tried to contact XXXX XXXX at their two different numbers at two points during the day and was unable to reach a representative. 

I called XXXX XXXX at XXXX XX/XX/23 to see what the issue was and they confirmed that, while busy, they were available from XXXX est time through XXXX XXXX est, so there shouldn't have been a reason for them not to reach someone. They did also confirm that they would not verify account ownership via voice call as part of their fraud policy and that verifying named ownership of an account is not a requirement for receipt of a wire as long as the routing and account number is correct. I called XXXX back directly after the conversation with XXXX XXXX and got the run around from several of their employees, stating the verification of ownership name on an account is a Marcus requirement and that they will not verify the information any other way than to verbally do so via phone call with that bank, and if the bank will not verify the information via phone then they will not approve the Wire or a transfer of funds ( which are the only two methods of moving money out of Marcus, which they advertise ). They stated that if I wanted to move funds to one of my other """" linked and verified accounts '' that the funds should go same day and there wouldn't be an issue since the ownership ( name on the account ) had been verified already and the account ( s ) at XXXX or XXXX had been used for several transfers and wires in and out of the account before. I asked them to transfer the available balance of my online savings back to my XXXX account at XXXX XXXX  est XX/XX/23, meaning the funds should be available in my XXXX account same day. 

They never processed the wire and it is still sitting there as of this morning. For some reason, they are holding my funds, and preventing me from withdrawing them. I have spoken to several Supervisors, none of which are helpful and just continue to tell me they are sorry I feel a certain way about the situation or that they are sorry for the inconvenience but there isnt anything they can do. Several of their representatives have hung up on me this week while trying to get details about what is going on and why. I have not yelled, cussed, though am clearly frustrated in tone and demeanor since I can not get viable answers to my questions and they seem to be making up their own rules as they go. I am now half a week in with no access to my money, which I need to move to a new bank and their refusal to assist is a huge red flag. I have never had a returned item on my account, XXXX negative history, returned deposit items, etc. I maintain about half a XXXX dollars in monies with them between multiple accounts, all of which are in good standing, so to have this much trouble transferring funds out seems like a larger issue all around. Consumers should not have to go through this many hoops in order to access liquid funds in a savings account from a financial institution.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","IN","46845","","Consent provided","Web",2023-07-26,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7309017,2023
2023-02-24,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Closing an account","Funds not received from closed account","On XX/XX/XXXX ( last Saturday  ) I received a message from Goldman Sachs Maucus Bank stated that an external bank, XXXX XXXX, was linked to my saving ( 3 ) accounts at Maucus and also attempting to transfer XXXX from my saving accounts. I went into my accounts and found that XXXX XXXX  was linked to my Maucus bank saving accounts, I have no any relationship with XXXX XXXX  and never authorized such linkage. I canceled the transfre and removed XXXX XXXX  from my """" external linked accounts '' at Maucus online banking website. I called the Maucus right away ( three times ), all I was told that I have to call back during the regular business hours. 

I called again on Monday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and reported the incident to Maucus 's tech support and being transferred to another """" Specialist '' who opened three new saving accounts and I transferred all funds from the existing accounts to the new accounts.

However, the next day, Maucus blocked all my access to my accounts, I called a number of times, I was told someone """" will call me back in two hours '' to help me unlock the accounts, no one called me back and I got the same answer whenever I calls. 

On Wednesday I asked the bank to closed all my accounts and send back the funds to my accounts with XXXX  XXXX XXXX where all the deposits were made from. However I spent over 6 hours and spoke with over a dozen of """" specialist, '' the calls were constantly being interrupt and the bank also block my cell number and email, hence I could not get any identity verification code the bank required to close my accounts. Until XXXX the last """" specialist '' told me all my accounts have been closed. 

On Thursday, the bank left a message in the morning and asked me call the bank. When I called, the same story, they told me they won't close my accounts and all funds were subjected a further review which will take 5 to 7 business days. I tried to speak to different specialists, after 3 hours, one of the specialist ( supervisor level ) helped me went through the whole process again and she was able to identified my identity on phone ( called me three times, one call to close each account ) and told me there won ; t be any issue and I should receive all fund back to my deposit account with XXXX  XXXX. Again one Thursday night two person from Maucus call me again and said he/she wanted to identify my identity again This is horrified and so frustrating, Maucus does not protect its customers, when incident occurred with their security system, they just blocked my account instead of finding what its the root cause. 

Goldman Sachs Maucus Bank is poorly managed by a group irresponsible """" specialists '' only a few are reasonable, most of them don't know how to respect customers and do their job. This security system of the bank is totally broken, how can the bank allow a third part bank linked to my account without my knowledge and authorization? As yesterday ( XX/XX/XXXX ), they still kept XXXX XXXX  on my accounts.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NJ","08902","Older American","Consent provided","Web",2023-03-24,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6612838,2023

2023-04-12,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Other features, terms, or problems","Problem with balance transfer","On XX/XX/2022, I applied for the XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX. Through the application I applied for a balance transfer from XXXX XXXX to Apple Card ( Goldman & Sachs ). I was approved for {$2300.00} to be transfer to the Apple Card. On XX/XX/2022, the balance transfer appeared in my XXXX XXXX account but not on my Apple Card. I waited 7 days because I know a transaction like can take a few days. When nothing happened I reached out to Apple and they notified me that they do not accept balance transfers electronically and that the money would be returned when received but that at the moment nothing had been received. I reached out to XXXX XXXX and I was told to wait because sometimes transaction can take up to 30 days. I kept waiting and called back but this time I did a three way call with Apple and XXXX XXXX. Apple informed XXXX XXXX that funds were not received so a refund could not be made. After Apple left the call XXXX XXXX offered me to escalate the issue with an investigation that could take up to 90 days. 

This was in XX/XX/2022. I kept calling throughout the 90 days and was told to wait and I did. At the beginning of XXXX, I decided to go personally to a XXXX XXXX branch here in XXXX. I went with all my Apple Card statements since XX/XX/2022 to show them that nothing was received. The banker told me that she would do everything in her power to help and apologized in behalf of the bank. After she made calls I was told the same that the 90 day investigation was still under place and that I needed to wait XXXX more weeks so I waited. I then received an email saying that the balance transfer was successful so no refund was going to be provided. I went back to the bank and met with the banker again and she told me the same but that she would try and find out more. 

She sent me a document via email of the balance transfer information and when reviewing the document I noticed that the credit card number was incorrect and that the bank where the money went was to a XXXX and not a Goldman & Sachs. I decided to call Apple again and the representative told me that they could start a payment dispute but that the credit card number entered did not belong to a XXXXldman & Sachs account. I informed all of this to the banker from XXXX XXXX and I was told that because I entered the information wrong and that the money had already been paid by the bank they could not do anything else for me. Nonetheless this experience has been the most frustrating ever. My bank to which I have entrusted my money for the past 2 years has not had my back or not even the will to help me contact XXXX which I can not contact because I do not have an account with them and I have been left to do an investigation myself when I do not have the resources a bank like XXXX XXXX do. I contacted XXXX XXXX again today to give them XXXX last chance and I was pretty much told that once the funds has already left the bank it was not their responsibility to contact XXXX or any other bank. 

I submitted a complain to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on XX/XX/2022. I received an answer from XXXX XXXX acknowledging the complain once again saying they could not do anything and nothing was going to be refunded. 

I called Apple Card ( Goldman & Sachs ) and told them about the situation again in XX/XX/2022 regarding the issue. Goldman & Sachs told me they would called me back. I received a call back a few days later and they gave me instructions to find a routing number for the transaction so they could track it. I reached out to XXXX XXXX and they provided me the same document I was provided by the XXXX XXXX banker. 

I decided to call XXXX directly and enter the wrong credit card number ( where the money supposedly went ) and it transfer me directly to Goldman & Sachs for Apple Card. When all this time I have been told that the account does not belong to them. I have had multiple phone calls throughout the entire year, followed every direction and nothing has happened and not because I have not tried but doors kept being closed.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","GA","30309","","Consent provided","Web",2023-04-12,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",6831913,2023

The link took me to what appeared to be the XXXX and a XXXX charge was requested to verify my identity. 

On XX/XX/2022, when someone asked if I had received a package from who I thought had made an error in my house number, I responded no, and showed them the text I got from XXXX. I clicked the link and a warning in red appeared indicating that it was a fraudulent phishing website. When I reviewed my credit card account there was no {$3.00} charge for XXXX, but instead XXXX charges for {$780.00} totaling {$1500.00} from the XXXX XXXX. I immediately notified Apple Card Goldman Sachs Bank USA and disputed the pending charges and requested that they immediately change my credit card number. I was told to watch transactions to see if they post, and if so, the dispute will initiate an investigation. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed a package on my porch which turned out to be an XXXX. I contacted XXXX as I knew this was related to the fraud. I was advised that XXXX iPads were delivered that day, XXXX to another address in XXXX, and the other one to mine. Representative stated the criminal likely planned to retrieve this package from outside my home, but did not since I was home. During the course of our conversation, the thief tried to make another {$510.00} charge on my credit card at XXXX XXXX but it was declined due to the account number being changed. The XXXX sales rep gave me the address where the second package was delivered and the email that was used. I requested a return label to return the package ( XXXX ) delivered to my home. The sales rep advised that he had changed the addresses on the web orders associated with these unauthorized purchases to prevent thief from receiving any additional information. He recommended that I contact the police since it is likely that someone had been observing my home to retrieve the package. I called the police and around XXXX, a deputy arrived and took a report. I then provided the police report number to Apple Card Goldman Sachs Bank USA. 

Today, I received XXXX emails from Apple Card Goldman Sachs Bank USA indicating that the investigation was complete and the merchant charge will remain on the account. XXXX stated : We reviewed available information which confirms that you authorized the purchase with the merchant. Upon review of my account, it now shows the XXXX transactions of {$780.00}. I called the credit card company, and they said they can send me a copy of the evidence used to make a decision. I spoke with XXXX XXXX and they reiterated that they can see on their end that the XXXX ID and email that were used when these unauthorized orders were placed were different than than what they have on file for me. They also reiterated that XXXX package was delivered to a different address, and there was an attempt to change the address of the XXXX that ultimately arrived at my home. XXXX stated that the evidence shows that I did NOT authorize charges. XXXX also stated that she could see that the process to generate a return label was started on XX/XX/XXXX, so she will complete process so that return label will be generated and sent to my email. 

I feel like I am speaking to a brick wall, as Apple Card Goldman Sachs Bank USA does not appear to be interested in performing a legitimate investigation. I am the victim and this company is victimizing me all over again even though I have done everything in my power to assist them in retrieving their property and locating the perpetrator.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","VA","225XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-02-03,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",6528741,2023

Please see the loan document. 
On the day of the installation, which was a very hot and humid day, neither the installation manger nor the salesperson was present. The two workers had much difficulty installing the window and the door. The window and the door did not fit in the cavities, which were created as the result of removing the existing window and the door. The workers tried their best, while constantly complaining about the weather. The railings where the window and the door open and shut were mostly stuck and they were not flowing smoothly. Please see the attached sheet provided to us by XXXX. It shows how important the installation is. The installation was faulty and the door and the window appear to be used with incorrect exact measurements. 
The workers gave us a completion check out sheet to sign that the work is completed and all standards are met. We refused to sign the sheet. XXXX can not produce this signed sheet from us, which is a normal thing to do upon the work completion. 
We began to contact the company and salesperson. They were not responsive, while claiming leaving many messages which did not exit. Eventually we got XXXX, the installation manager to come out and examine the works. He was disappointed in the works performed. This was clear from his expressions and the words he was uttering. He took at least 30 pictures on his XXXX and took extensive notes. He said he would talk to the general manger, XXXX XXXX XXXX about this. 
The work required replacements of the window and the door. XXXX and XXXX XXXX did not want to do that then, days after the installation and now. The new window and the door would cost a lot for XXXX. They want to send someone ( in the areawho does not work for the company ) to fix something. XXXX XXXX wants to put a Band-Aid on the problems and get the problems over with. The installation was faulty and thats what XXXX, the installation manger told us in so many words. 
We sued XXXX in XXXX XXXX, MO for {$5000.00} in the small claims court. He refused to accept the summons and lied about not accepting the summons. We sent the court documents to GrenSky. XXXX XXXX upon our recent contacts with him stated that there is no record/memory of our complaints and our contact with him about our problems. Then he backtracked once we provided documentation to him to show otherwise. 
In short we have done anything humanely possible with XXXX and XXXX XXXX. He believes that we have no installation problems ; we have never sued him, somehow someone can fix somethingsomething that he does not what it is ( or what they are ). We are the end of our good faith and lengthy process of finding a resolution with XXXX XXXX. He hires unqualified installers for $ XXXX hour and uses his limited warranty to avoid accountability. He knows how to refuse summons and not face the court. XXXX is an aggressive company with multi-advertising and promotion campaigns from TV infomercial to people knocking on your door. Their efforts are concentrated on sales rather than doing the work right. Their prices are at least twice as much as those of many of its competitors. 
XXXX installed faulty window/door. This has nothing to do with the limited warranty. This is a fraudulent business activity. The loan secured on this fraudulent business activity is a fraud as well. We have paid a significant portion of this fraudulent contract. This paragraph comes from the loan agreement you gave us : """" If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your Loan, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the Merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.

I called Marcus again on XX/XX/XXXX and was on hold back and forth with Marcus reps for almost 40 minutes. I asked them if it was possible to just send the money back to XXXX XXXX and close the account. They said that they could not do that and accused me of being """" suspicious ''. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a generic email stating that my account had been closed. There was no information about what happened to my money or how to obtain my money.To this date no one will provide an answer as to what happened with my account. I immediately called and I had to call back 3 times to find someone who could help me. The first cal was 12 minutes, the second call was 22 minutes, and the third call was 9 minutes. At that time I was traveling in XXXX. I explained to the rep that I would be home on XX/XX/XXXX. She told me that we would have to sign and notarize a document to receive our money. At that point I said ok please send the document. When I arrived home there was no document from Marcus. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX for 15 minutes and I was told """" sorry '' and new documents would be sent out. I was told that I would receive them in 3-5 days. On XX/XX/XXXX I called back because I still had not received the documents. I was told by a Marcus rep that it is actually 7-10 business days so I would need to wait until XX/XX/XXXX and that the documents were sent on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I still had not received the documents. I called Marcus again, this time for 52 minutes talking with reps and being put on hold why they research my situation. I was told by the second rep that the papers were resent on XX/XX/XXXX and it would take 7-10 business days to receive them. I politely explained that this is not acceptable. I have been waiting for these papers since XXXX and I have not had access to my money since XXXX. I asked her if Marcus could produce evidence that the papers have been sent. She said they could not. I asked if the papers could be sent with a tracking number and/or a signature requirement and she said they could not. It is ironic that Marcus locked my money and closed my account because they claim my phone number could not prove who I am, but now they are holding my money and providing no proof that they are working to restore it back to me.

The whole point I use a credit card overseas is to protect myself from things like this happening. In the few times it has happened, my other providers ( XXXX and XXXX XXXX ) have timely and efficiently resolved the claim and gotten me back my money. This is the first time Ive ever filed a fraud claim and been denied, and I believe the first claim filed on Apple Card as I mostly use my XXXX and XXXX XXXX. Goldman Sachs keeps requesting that I provide more evidence, but that is not reasonable. The main evidence should be that nobody spends {$190.00} on a XXXX  in XXXX and the commonality of this scam! Especially to XXXX XXXX XXXX! 

To others, dont use your Apple Card if you want any type of fraud protection, they will close your claim in the scammers favor and leave you hanging with the bill. This is a company operating in bad faith with their clients, and I see why the consumer department is going out of business! I wish this would get fairly resolved, so I never have to deal with these crook accomplices again!","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","GA","30052","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-27,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",8062438,2023

2023-01-28,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem with a purchase shown on your statement","Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card","Apple Card Dispute I woke up on XX/XX/XXXX and saw that XXXX unauthorized charges had been to my Apple Card overnight at XXXX. XXXX was for {$310.00} and the other was {$310.00}. I immediately reported both these charges and froze the card. XXXX sent me an email for a dispute for each separate transaction and said it would be XXXX  days until I heard their decision. I was confused because I had never encountered this with a credit card before. The only other time in my life I've had a fraud charge on a credit card was with XXXX, and it was for {$3.00}. They immediately removed the charge and gave me a new card, and did not say there was any kind of dispute. This is the first time I've had a fraud charge happen with an Apple Card. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I got an email for the dispute on the {$310.00} charge and was informed that it was fraud and would be removed from my account. The next day on XX/XX/XXXX I received an email stating that XXXX had sufficient evidence that I had made the purchase for {$310.00} and that I needed to pay that balance. I re-disputed the charge. I received a decision for that on XX/XX/XXXX, saying that the charge would again remain on my account. I re-disputed it again and asked for their documentation on my case. I called XXXX to see if they had any information on their end or could help me in any way. The man on the phone was able to locate the exact charge using the date, amount, and last XXXX digits of that previous card number ( before I froze it ). He gave me the order number : XXXX. He listed off a bunch of things in the order that I definitely did not buy, and he said that it was confirmed to be shipped to my home address. I told him I had never ordered those things and did not receive any packages at my home address from XXXX with those items. He said they could easily fix it on their end and refund me, then transferred me to someone who was supposed to help with that, and she said since it was fraud she couldn't do anything to help me and I needed to settle the dispute through my bank. 

I called Apple Card support back after that and was informed that I needed to submit proof that I did not make the purchase through their chat service in the wallet app. I opened the chat service and after stating that I wanted to provide more evidence related to my dispute, I started receiving error messages. For XXXX days I attempted to contact XXXX support through this chat service and received the same error message every time. I tried restarting my phone, updating my phone, restarting the apps, etc. Nothing worked. Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX back and told them what was happening. I also mentioned that I still had not received documentation from them in regards to my dispute. The woman on the phone said I should have received an email asking me to submit my own documentation related to the dispute. I said I had not received that, that all the emails I'd received up to this point told me no further action was needed. I even checked my spam folder. She went into my account to try and re-send the email, but said an error was occurring on her end that would not allow her to send me the email prompting me for documentation. She said eventually she was able to send it and that I should try the chat function again, but if for some reason I didn't receive that or the chat still wasn't working, I should call back. I never received that email and the chat feature still did not work, even after I contacted tech support to help me. 

Attached are screenshots of my XXXX order history, my email from XXXX XXXX showing no emails from XXXX, each dated email from XXXX showing the disputes and their resolutions, the language in the dispute emails telling me no further action was needed, and my chats with Apple Card support showing the error messages over the course of XXXX days after I had stated that I wanted to provide further evidence. {$310.00} is an incredible amount of money, especially during these hard times, and XXXX has a policy that states I am never responsible for an unauthorized charge ( attached is a screenshot of a text reiterating this policy ). I do not understand why XXXX transaction was discovered to be fraud while the other was not. Both of these were fraud, and I feel that I have sufficient evidence proving this, combined with my history of never having had this issue before, and prior to this incident had only ever had a XXXX  fraud charge on a credit card. This whole process had been taking up all my breaks at work and has caused me an unfair amount of distress. I have made more than reasonable effort to reach out to the merchant and my bank to resolve this dispute, but my bank is making it literally impossible to provide evidence supporting my case. 

Update on XX/XX/XXXX, I received the """" evidence '' from the merchant that XXXX provided via paper in the mail. I am also attaching this. The name listed on the card that was used, which was my card number, is not my name. There is an email address and phone number listed for this person as well that I am unfamiliar with. I used this information to make a police report. ( Case number XXXX ). The evidence shows that the packages were delivered to my house, but I never received anything like that. I don't know if someone came and picked those up off my porch or what but that's even more concerning if they did. I feel that this evidence shows even further that I WAS NOT THE ONE WHO MADE THIS PURCHASE. It shows clearly the name listed on my card in the evidence as XXXX XXXX, and that is OBVIOUSLY not my name, nor has that name ever been on my account.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","OR","97306","","Consent provided","Web",2023-01-28,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",6494494,2023

This resulted in Apple Card/GS Bank retroactively changing credit bureau reporting for XX/XX/XXXX to suggest a payment at 30+ days late. New documents and the following information show that not to be the case, and that this issue did not originate with the consumer ( myself ) or XXXX XXXX Apple Card 's earlier response to an investigation state : """" The Bank directs the Customer to the financial institution the payments came from regarding the returned payments. """" My bank, XXXXXXXX XXXX responded ( letter attached ) stating that there were no interactions - debits or credits - related to the returned payments Apple Card mentions, rendering it impossible for XXXXXXXX XXXX let alone myself, to have requested returns, or for XXXX XXXX to have rejected payments. I received """" payment failed '' notifications on XX/XX/2023 for Apple Card payments ranging XXXX. Those payments, including the payment on XX/XX/XXXX for {$190.00}, showed as """" posted/successful '' on the Apple Card for 45 days. Neither Apple Card or myself had any knowledge of XXXX 's payment being anything other than satisfactory from XXXX. The card 's balance reflected that payment as successful, and the available credit reflected a successful/satisfactory payment. Furthermore, within an hour of receiving notifications that there was an issue with payments, it was rectified... I re-sent payments immediately and followed up diligently to ensure their success. It is worth noting that had I chose to follow up every day from XXXX to ensure XXXX 's payment was successful, I would have been told """" yes. '' Initially, Apple Card reported a XXXX days late payment for the month of XXXX to credit bureaus ( XXXX were accurately reported as on time ). This was false, as Apple Card statements for every month since membership began shows on-time payments. Apple Card corrected the month of XXXX to show """" on time '', then retroactively changed XXXX 's status to """" XXXX days late. '' Apple Card responses state that because XXXX 's payment was """" returned '' it rendered it late, and they are required to report it as such. However, every document included in this complaint shows that the consumer ( myself ) fulfilled all obligations to make on time payments, had no knowledge of the need to re-issue a payment, and that my bank had zero knowledge of any issues. The moment an issue XXXX, it was rectified. If Apple Card had payments left """" unsatisfied '' for XXXX, such was only the case for an hour. There were no late notifications in the months/weeks leading up to this, and the card functioned normally. Lastly, it's worth noting that over the course of several interactions with supervisors, one Apple Card representative did discover an issue on their end that caused this, and it is NOT the issue stated in Apple Card 's previous CFPB response. This representative spent hours identifying, detailing and notating the issue from their end, but it appears that those notes are either buried deeper than Apple Card cares to investigate, or they can not be found. The attached letter from XXXX XXXX along with XXXX XXXX  statements showing no interactions from Apple Card on these transactions, should be considered as proof that myself nor my bank did not initiate returns. XXXX 's XXXX XXXX statement shows no returns corresponding with Apple Card 's XXXX statement. As a consumer, I seem to be lost in the middle of technical glitches, and regardless of their origin, all I have done is pay the Apple Card bill on time, every month, and work to resolve any errors stemming from companies promptly. I kindly request that the Apple Card/GS Bank correct XX/XX/2023 's credit bureau reporting to reflect that I made those payments on time ... any issues arising from those payments were beyond mine and my bank 's control.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","TN","37066","","Consent provided","Web",2023-11-30,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7925848,2023

2023-11-12,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Managing an account","Deposits and withdrawals","I opened a high yield savings account with Marcus by Goldman Sachs for their high yield savings interest. When I tried to withdraw a bulk of the money out of Marcus, it was reversed.

My first attempt in calling Marcus was a 1
.5 hrs call ending in a dropped call. During that 1.5 hours on the phone, the first representative said that I was being transferred to another representative that can better assist me. The next representative had no idea what the call was about and proceeded to ask me security questions as if I just called in. After multiple holds to """" check to see what's going on with my account '', I was again transferred to another representative that again asked for my personal information for verification. At this point, I'm starting to believe none of the previous representatives knew the problem and proceeded to put me back in the queue for another representative to """" help '' me out. Then after being held on hold for a few mins, the phone disconnected. 

After trying to call again, I was finally told that there is a hold in my account. The first representative told me that there is a hold on my account due to some garnishment but could not tell me who or what is putting that hold. They said it could be the receiving bank ( XXXX in this case ) or some other agency/institution but they do not have visibility on that. They did mention that they can usually see if it's the IRS and that there was no indication that it was that institution that put a hold on my account- I never heard """" IRS '' spoken after this representative. I've asked to speak to supervisors but even they would just say that they do not have any additional details and have no idea how to help me out. They can not give me ANY information about the """" garnishment '' on my account and I am told there are no other departments, or any other person I can talk to to try to figure out how to resolve the problem. 

I proceeded to contact XXXX, and they saw that there was a hold that could potentially have been from being flagged as a potential fraudulent transaction but they immediately resolved this. I was able to link my Marcus account to my XXXX account within the XXXX app and tried to initiate the transfer from XXXX instead for the same amount. After a few days of processing, it was reversed again. I called XXXX again - the Marcus linked account was suspended in their system but they were able to lift it again.

I went back to my Marcus app and tried to initiate the transfer once again from the Marcus app. At this point, I am not even able to initiate the transfer. I just end up getting a constant error telling me to """" please try again ''. I figured if it's an issue with XXXX, I can try to transfer it to a different bank. But I am now also unable to link new accounts to my Marcus.

Called Marcus again and just like the last time, they see a hold but they are unable to give any information. My money is with them but they can't tell me how I can be able to get access to that at this point. They say there is no department within Marcus that can give me that information because of the sensitive nature. I would think it may be sensitive at their level or for their team but there should at least be some team that would be able to tell me this information - information about my money that is being held by them. I should be entitled to information about my own assets. They make it seem like whatever this institution is that has put this hold will need to lift it, but I would not be able to figure out how to resolve it because they wouldn't be able to tell me who is putting the hold- I can only sit, wait and hope while they keep my money that whoever this mysterious institution is suddenly decides to lift whatever hold is put on my account. I asked if I can just close my account altogether but even that I apparently can't do. 

On my part, I have not received any letter or any notification of a potential garnishment to any of my accounts. I have no kids which means I am not responsible in paying child support and I pay my student loan every month. I've gone as far as finding a way to contact the IRS to confirm that I have no balances I owe to the government - I don't. The agent confirmed that I have XXXX balance. 

None of this makes sense as I also just closed on a house which did an extensive check on my personal and financial situation. I also have multiple bank accounts, but somehow Marcus by Goldman Sachs is the only bank that has a garnishment under my name and holding my money.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NJ","078XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-11-12,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7837777,2023

I had spoke to multiple reps while the situation was happening and followed their guidance. The rental agency was threatening to call the police so I had to release the dispute then refile after we had checked out per the advice of Apple/GS. The dispute was ultimately ruled in favor of the rental house ( property management ) even though I sent photos of someone else 's dirty clothes, rats, broken A/C and broken elevator etc. At that time, I made the decision that I no longer wanted to do business with Apple/GS and paid the account balance IN FULL and closed the account. This past XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I got a letter in the mail from A/GS stating that they decided on multiple disputes incorrectly and would be re-opening them to adjust the rulings. I DID NOT initiate this contact, they did. I called into A/GS and the rep I talked to had no idea about the letter or knowledge of the fact that they as a company were reevaluating closed disputes. My account remains closed. Fast forward a few months and I get a letter that states they did not rule in my favor ( again ). I do not care, I didn't ask for any action to be taken. They initiated.

I called in to arrange to pay them to get them out of my life once and for all and I told them I would pay it as long as they did not hurt my credit. I was told they would have to file with their internal credit and they would get back to me. I followed up and tried to pay again and was told that I had to wait until the credit dispute was done. Not shocking, they upheld the negative credit rating and said it was correct. This is ludicrous as even THEIR OWN reps could not tell me why there was a balance. I finally spoke with a supervisor and he said there was nothing that could be done because I owed the money. I am not even disputing that anymore but it is completely unreasonable to expect me to pay for something that I did not charge. THEY gave me a random credit and now want it back. He said he wanted to find a way to fix this for me but he couldn't because I owed the money. He continually said he completely understood how I felt but that it was too bad and the credit stands despite the fact that we both agree on that I DID NOT USE the card. I just want my credit back. This has been an absolute nightmare. I have not heard anything from them since they told me there was nothing they could do. I want to get this resolved and never do business with GS or Apple Card again.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","SC","294XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-03-20,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6720015,2023
2023-12-01,"Credit card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Getting a credit card","Application denied","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA ( XX/XX/2023 ) NOTICE TO AGENT IS NOTICE TO PRINCIPAL NOTICE TO PRINCIPAL IS NOTICE TO AGENT I recently applied for a APPLE CARD credit card and got denied on XX/XX/2023. In pursuant to 15 USC 1602 ( l ) the term credit card was used to initiate the consumer credit transaction. The term credit card means any card, plate, coupon book or other credit device used to obtain money, property, labor, or services on credit. I am the card holder and holder in due course. In pursuant to 15 USC 1602 ( n ) I am the one who came in with the credit card to initiate the transaction. It is not possible to get denied with something that I came in with. The term adverse action in 15 USC 1681 ( a ) never mentions anything to do with the consumer getting denied credit because its impossible to get denied something in which I am granting to your corporation the right to extend credit. In pursuant to 15 USC 1602 the term credit means the right granted by a creditor to a debt or deferred payments of debt or to incurred debt in deferred payments. Credit is my right and Im the one who regularly extends credit in the connection with loans and pursuant to 15 USC 1602 ( g ) I am the original creditor and I am well aware of my rights. I know that reporting to the consumer reporting agencies is voluntary notice. This is a private transaction and this is an unfavorable situation to me for the consumer. Nowhere in the term adverse action defined within the FCRA does it mention that a natural person can be denied credit. As an original creditor it is not lawful to be denied my right to grant credit. Furthermore my credit was used and I received no benefit from thr use of my credit. An inquiry popped on my consumer report which was the receipt of a transaction meaning somebody got paid off my credit and I received no benefit from it at all. In fact damages were done from the denial of my rights mentally and financially. Under 15 USC 1643 ( e ) the term unauthorized use means a credit card by a person other than that the cardholder who does not have actual implied or apparent authority or such use for from the cardholder which receives no benefit. Ive been discriminated against as there are no federal laws that state a credit score can deny me and my right to extend credit. Ive in good faith exercise my right and I the natural person have been discriminated against the pursuant to 15 USC 1691 Equal credit opportunity act. It shall be unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction. For the damages that have been done to my mental distress and financial reputation as I take my consumer report in life seriously. I will take this to a federal level if my request to open the account in which adverse action has taken place. Im aware of my open end credit plan and right to contract unlimited credit without being denied. I demand your company reinvestigations matter and abide by federal law to open up the account in which Ive extended credit.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","MD","21403","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-01,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7936519,2023
2023-08-08,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","Personal line of credit","Charged fees or interest you didn't expect","","The complaint I am filing with CFPB is with GreenSky. In order to describe this thoroughly, I need to also mention the involvement of XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I hired XXXX XXXX XXXX to replace all the windows in my home, and decided to finance this project via GreenSky due to the promotional rate GreenSky was offering. After the windows were installed, I noticed that some of the windows were missing window stoppers. I reached out several times to XXXX to have them finish the installation and supply the window stoppers, but I was unsuccessful in getting XXXX to comply. 

Per GreenSkys Customer Bill of Rights, I filed a dispute with GreenSky regarding the window stoppers that Power never installed. GreenSky credited my account on XX/XX/2023 with a provisional credit of {$2200.00}, According to GreenSkys policy, this credit can be removed if XXXX ever completed the installation. It is important to note that XXXX never completed the installation, never supplied me with the correct window stoppers and never contacted me again after my last email exchange with them on XX/XX/2023. 

GreenSky subsequently sent me a letter dated XX/XX/2023, which is a week after they credited my account with the provisional credit. This letter states that as a result of their investigation of my dispute, The provisional credit previously applied to your account will now become permanent. This means that the {$2200.00} credit I received is now permanent and I am no longer responsible for paying it. 

On XX/XX/2023, I called and spoke with DeCarlos, a Customer Solutions Account Manager at GreenSky, XXXX ext. XXXX, to follow up with GreenSky about my dispute with XXXX. In this conversation I notified XXXX that XXXX had still not supplied the window stoppers. XXXX reviewed my account information, saw the aforementioned letter in my account and verified the credit to my account was permanent. At this point, I communicated to XXXX that I decided not to bother pursuing XXXX anymore to rectify the situation since the credit was permanent. I would just live with not having the correct window stoppers. As I stated earlier, XXXX has still not supplied the window stoppers and never contacted me again to complete the project. 

I made the minimum payments on time for the statement periods ending XX/XX/2023 and XX/XX/2023, respectively. At this point, my payoff ( remaining ) balance is now {$19000.00}, and this dollar amount includes the permanent credit of {$2200.00} previously applied to my account. 

I paid off the remaining balance on XX/XX/2023, XXXX day before the due date of XX/XX/2023. I received an email from GreenSky acknowledging receipt of that payment. At this point, I have completely paid off the loan. 

Much to my surprise, once I paid off the loan, GreenSky sent me another statement for the period ending XX/XX/2023, saying I still have a balance. This statement shows I submitted the aforementioned payment of {$19000.00}, although it lists the date incorrectly as XX/XX/2023 ( a minor detail ). Without communicating anything to me, either through email, snail mail, or a phone call, GreenSky removed the permanent credit of {$2200.00}. 

I called GreenSky to inquire about their error on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and several times on XX/XX/XXXX. During one of these calls, I came to find out that XXXX told GreenSky on XX/XX/2023 that they ( XXXX ) completed the project, which is completely false. This led to GreenSky reversing the credit, however, the credit was deemed permanent! It seems GreenSky needs a review of basic vocabulary as to the definition of the word permanent. In addition, GreenSky never reached out to me to inquire if the project was in fact completed, which it was not. 

For the calls made on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, I was able to speak with XXXX again both times. During those calls, I specifically asked for an email correspondence rather than phone calls due to my work schedule. XXXX assured me he would follow up with me one way or another and would initiate an email correspondence. However, I have never heard back from anyone at GreenSky to provide an update or rectify this issue, be it a phone call, voice mail or email, hence my subsequent calls on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX. I have checked my Junk email folder and made sure my phone had space to receive voice mails, so I know GreenSky has not contacted me regarding this issue. The only correspondence I have received are XXXX subsequent statements and collection notices claiming my account is past due, which is false. 

My credit scores from all three rating agencies have consistently been near or above XXXX, which is an indication of my financial character to pay my bills and keep accurate records. I have also since learned that XXXX XXXX, the parent company of GreenSky, is suffering major loses due to its acquisition of GreenSky and is trying to sell GreenSky. It turns out that GreenSky has never turned a profit and losses have reportedly amounted to over {$3.00} XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXgreensky/ ). What is more likely, a person with my track record suddenly deciding not to pay his bills or a company that is having financial issues doing whatever they can to diminish their losses. 

I have not bothered trying to contact GreenSky again because it is obvious to me that GreenSky is not operating in good faith and is not conducting good business practices. They refuse to acknowledge their mistake and quite possibly are doing so due to their financial difficulties. The {$2200.00} credit should never have been removed from my account for either of the following reasons : I still have not received the window stoppers but more importantly, GreenSky sent me a letter ( a legal document ) deeming the credit permanent.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NY","11010","","Consent provided","Web",2023-08-08,"Closed with non-monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7368843,2023
2023-11-08,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Managing an account","Deposits and withdrawals","I am a long-term customer of Marcus by Goldman Sachs . I have XXXX Savings Accounts, all of which were locked on XX/XX/2023. I did not receive any notification that the accounts were locked and only learned when I called to check the status of a bank wire. The representative said there was a note on my account that the bank cancelled the wire when they could not reach me by telephone days ago. I was later told by a supervisor that no call was ever made and there was in fact, no such note. 

The bank then refused to use any of my personal information to verify my identity, including my social security number, date of birth, and secret word. They also refused to send a one-time password to my phone. They said that my cell number is now invalid and they must instead send me an """" affidavit of identity '' to notarize and return. Even though the form is initially blank, they will only send it via first class mail. Meanwhile all of my funds will be frozen, leaving me without funds to pay my bills. They also said they can not tell me the reason for the hold without the affidavit. 

I have read many accounts on this website and others that Marcus can take weeks to unlock the account, even after receiving the affidavit. I will be forced to liquidate an investment to generate enough cash to pay my bills, including the ones that come out of the Marcus accounts automatically. 

It was completely unprofessional to not contact me and inform me about the locked status and to misinform me about the attempt to call me. It was also completely unprofessional to refuse to use any reasonable method to verify my identity and to delay the form by forcing it to go via snail mail in both directions.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NV","XXXXX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-11-08,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7824792,2023

I have used this checking account exclusively throughout the life of my account with XXXX successful transactions. I contacted Apple Card support since the available credit did not update as it normally does. I was told this transaction will reflect on XX/XX/23 and that the payment was on hold.

When calling Apple Card support on XX/XX/23, I was told by a manager that the Apple Card Customer Agreement allows for 10 days to process payments. However, this information is not found in the Apple Card Customer Agreement, which reads """" Electronic Payments If you initiate a one-time payment using a Payment Source Account before XXXXXXXX XXXX ET, we will credit the payment as of that calendar day. Otherwise, we will credit your payment as of the next day. '' Thus, the payment should be applied to the account.

2023-10-02,"Credit card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem with a purchase shown on your statement","Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card","I discovered a fraudulent purchase on my Apple/Goldman Sachs credit card that was made overnight while I was sleeping. I immediately checked my Apple ID and subscriptions to confirm that nothing was charged overnight that should have been charged. After some quick research, I verified that the transaction was fraudulent and I requested an Apple Card/Goldman Sachs customer service representative to help me remove the charge.

Apple Card/Goldman Sachs provides two methods to contact customer service - a phone number, where customers languish on hold for more than XXXX hour, and a chat service through the XXXX service. Customer service representatives can not be contacted through either method, and it is clear that the system is designed to prevent customers from being able to speak with representatives. 

I opened a chat to share XXXX screenshots with customer service to show that the charge on my credit card did not originate from my XXXX account. These XXXX screenshots are attached to this complaint. I sat on the customer support chat for three-plus hours and I received no response from Apple/Goldman Sachs . I also tried to call the phone number for support and have yet to be able to reach anyone. Meanwhile, I will be charged interest for this fraudulent purchase, which is something that I believe Apple Card/Goldman Sachs has done previously because it takes them so long to remove charges from accounts. 

I do want to point out that this is a frequent pattern for Apple/Goldman Sachs . My card information has been stolen several times, despite the numbers allegedly changing every XXXX  days, and every time I have to report fraud, it is a taxing and exhausting experience. It should not be this difficult to remove a fraudulent purchase from a credit card account.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","MO","XXXXX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-10-02,"Closed with non-monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7621736,2023

I was giving seven to ten business days which passed a long time ago. I call everyday and they STILL said they had no update. Absolutely unacceptable when I have a considerable amount of money in the account. Something needs to be done, going a month and half without any information is not okay. A bank should not be allowed to hold your money hostage when a customer request the account to be closed. I have no avenue to get my money which I think seems highly illegal.

Moreover, in accordance with the """" saving to suitors '' clause as prescribed in sections 41 ( 3 ) and 371 ( 3 ) of title 28, U.S.C., I am asserting my rights to seek resolution of this matter through appropriate channels. The fraudulent reporting of these inquiries is in direct violation of the principles enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, which upholds the sanctity of individual rights and protections. 
I kindly request that you promptly investigate this matter and initiate the necessary steps to delete these unauthorized inquiries from my consumer report. It is crucial that your agency takes immediate action to rectify this error, as the presence of these inquiries is not only inaccurate but also has the potential to impact my creditworthiness and financial well-being. 
Please find my information below for reference : Name : XXXX XXXX Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NC XXXX Email Address : XXXX I expect your full cooperation in resolving this matter expeditiously, within the prescribed timeframes as defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) or 30 days from this document 's date.

I would appreciate a written confirmation acknowledging receipt of this dispute letter and providing an outline of the actions you intend to take to address this matter. Furthermore, I request that you provide me with a copy of my updated consumer report once the unauthorized inquiries have been removed.

Upon calling Apple customer service, it was discovered that charges for several months were made not on my physical card but digitally perhaps from Apple phones I donated. Therefore they reversed over {$700.00} in charges which obviously would not have made me late on a payment. However, the credit bureaus are still keeping the late payment report on my credit and worse yet, its not scheduled to be deleted until XXXX. Thats ridiculous! My credit score was over XXXX prior to this incident that was not of my doing. Apple Card now owes me a check of {$720.00} due to all of these fraudulent charges. Therefore, I am demanding that these negative 30 day late reports be taken off all three credit bureau reports, which are greatly affecting my credit score of near perfect.

2023-12-17,"Credit card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Other features, terms, or problems","Other problem","I had my Apple ( Goldman Sachs ) card hacked back in spring of 2023. I do not have the exact date as I no longer have access to account or email. When this occurred Apple Card contacted me to question the fraudulent charges that had been made. I confirmed that it was fraudulent. They then changed my online credit card #, but did not cancel the physical card, as I had possession of it. Later that day I received a call ( supposedly from apple card ) saying there had been more fraudulent charges. I gave them the information they requested, until they asked for my entire social security # and it just started to seem fishy, at which time I hung up. I called Apple Card to see if that call was actually them and they had no record of a call being made to me. I then told the apple customer service people exactly what had transpired. I had assumed at this time my card and account were closed and canceled, due to all my personal information being taken by the fraudulent call. At the same time my card was hacked so was my Apple ID, email associated with that account. 

From that date forward I never received any sort of communication from apple card. I foolishly assumed that the card was cancelled and the account closed. On XX/XX/2023 I called Goldman Sachs to get a new credit card/account. I was told my account was still open and it had a very large balance, $ XXXX approximately at that time. I said that all has to be fraudulent charges. At that time I was transferred to someone else who could help with fraud. While speaking to this person she said that my bank had been making payments, the last auto payment was made in XXXX in the amount of {$6200.00}. I was shocked to hear this. Then I was transferred to another person to assist me. It was decided the best way to figure out the date this fraudulent activity started-would be to get a copy of all my statements. When getting my address to mail them to me she let me know that the address on the account along with phone number and email- all had been changed by the people who hacked my account. All of my information had been changed by these hackers. In that case since none of my information matched what is associated with the account they could not send me any statements. She told me she escalated it to the powers that be. She also advised me to write a letter of formal dispute, done XX/XX/2023. I looked through all my bank statements from XX/XX/2023 and found that XX/XX/XXXX is when the fraudulent charges started. Close to {$50000.00} in fraudulent charges. My credit has been greatly affected as well. I am trying to get my money back that has been paid towards my bill-but it was all fraud. 

On XX/XX/2023 I contacted my bank to stop any further payments to Goldman Sachs. 

My coworker recommended contacting the attorney general to further escalate my issue, which I have done, XX/XX/2023. I have spoken to apple card specialists numerous times ; the dates are : XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX. XX/XX/2023. Every time I have to explain my whole situation, spend an hour or two speaking to them, and then nothing happens. I am writing to find out if there is any help or guidance to be offered. I do not have access to the email associated with this account therefore I have no way of communication except for the XXXX #. Each time I speak with someone I have escalated it to the supervisor. I am told I will receive communication via mail within 2 weeks-which has never happened. I have now been trying to get this resolved for 3+ months. I am at a loss of what my next steps are.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","CO","80205","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-17,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",8016465,2023

I pay this account via my credit union 's billpayer service, provided by XXXX, and two months in a row Goldman Sachs has not timely credited my payments. This is not an issue with any other company I do business with and was not an issue with Goldman Sachs until recently. 

The XXXX payment was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX, the due date on the statement, and did not post until XXXX, resulting in an interest charge I should not have been assessed as the statement balance was paid in full. In this instance, Goldman Sachs backdated the payment to XX/XX/XXXX and credited me the interest charges, without my asking them to do so. With the latest episode, I scheduled a payment for the full statement balance on XX/XX/XXXX, which was also before the due date of XX/XX/XXXX, and they did not credit it until XXXX. They refuse to reverse the interest charges for this """" late '' payment. They have refunded {$25.00} and say that is all they can do. They can not explain why this payment was not backdated as happened in the previous month, or why they are posting these payments late. 

They are continuing to accrue interest on my account, despite it being paid on time and in full. Today I received an e-mail saying they have closed my investigation and will not be refunding the interest charges.

2023-02-16,"Checking or savings account","CD (Certificate of Deposit)","Closing an account","Can't close your account","Marcus Goldman Sachs is engaging in a pattern of manipulation and dishonesty to prevent customers from withdrawing money from their institution. Here are the details : I opened a certificate of deposit account with Marcus at Goldman Sachs on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of $ XXXX. I funded the account via an ACH transfer through my XXXX XXXX Account. The money was debited from my XXXX XXXX account and credited to the Marcus account on XX/XX/XXXX ( i.e., the same day it was opened ). 

After attempting to add my husband to the account and having a terrible customer service experience doing so, I tried to close the account. I was told via their customer service chat function that this could only be done by calling their customer service number. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called and spoke to a representative named XXXX. I asked to close the account. He placed me on hold and the call was cut off. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called and spoke to a representative named XXXX. I asked to close the account. She executed the account closure, but told me that the money would be on hold until XX/XX/XXXX, and so I needed to call back on that day to complete the account closure process. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called and spoke to a representative named XXXX. She told me that the money was on hold until XX/XX/XXXX, and that I needed to call back on XX/XX/XXXX to close the account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called and spoke to a representative named XXXX. XXXX confirmed that the hold was removed from the funds, and he closed the account. He transferred the money back to the original XXXX XXXX account that the money originally came from via ACH transfer. XXXX told me that the money should be back in my XXXX XXXX account by XX/XX/XXXX at the latest. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the money had not been credited to my XXXX XXXX account, nor did my Marcus account show that a debit, or account closure was in process. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke to a representative named XXXX. She stated that the money in my account was placed on another hold, and would not be released until XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore, I asked to speak to a supervisor. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I next spoke to a supervisor named XXXX who confirmed that the money in the account was on hold, and that closing the account would take an additional 10 business days PLUS an additional 3 business days for the ACH transfer to be completed, which would be an additional 2.50 weeks total. I asked why there were so many holds being placed on the money, and why it was taking so long for the money to be transferred back to the account where it originated from, and XXXX said that this is just reflective of Marcuss policies and processes. 

I am filing this complaint because I believe that Marcus is engaging in a pattern of deception, inefficiency, and deliberately slow processing times in order to retain their customers monies as long as possible, and I believe this pattern needs oversight and intervention by the US Government. In addition, I still do not have my money, and my account is still not closed, despite many attempts and requests to have the account closed.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NC","27406","","Consent provided","Web",2023-03-15,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",6582457,2023

2023-07-28,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem when making payments","Problem during payment process","I had an Apple Card balance {$530.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, my father XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX his XXXX checking account ending # XXXX to pay off the balance. Apple Card is issued by XXXX XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the AutoPay charged me again from my XXXX checking account ending # XXXX for the same {$530.00}. 

I called Apple to refund the duplicated amount from my checking account, I was told to go to my bank to set up a dispute to recover account, they could not refund directly, since it was an autopay. I followed the instruction, and I recovered the duplicated {$530.00}. After that, I got Apple email on XX/XX/XXXX saying that I owe {$530.00} plus interest, which is XXXX. It has been showing in my Apple Card message until now. 

Since then, I contacted Apple Card through phone calls and Chat many times. I was confirmed that they did see the {$530.00} payment history, and would resolve the issue. They also told me that I would get an email, so I can submit documents with explanations.. 

I never got any emails to allow me to submit written explanations. I got 4 managements calling me, I had t o repeat the same explanations over and over again, but none of them resolved the issue. I was also told to use Apple Chat, and I did. 

The XXXX one told me to expect an email to explain ( XX/XX/XXXX ), it never happened. The XXXX one said the {$530.00} actually went to my previously closed account, asking if I was willing to transfer to the currently active account ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Then the line got cut off, she never called me back. The XXXX XXXX told me to do Apple Chat ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I told her that I already did, and I was promised an email ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I got no email. The XXXX one asked me to call Customer Service, and suggested the I paid the minimum {$25.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX ). 

I finally learned after about 1 month that I would not be able to resolve this issue by myself with Apple Card, and currently I still see my Apple Card being """" restricted '' with {$540.00} balance. Apple Card did not reject the payment from my closed card, after they knew it, and they would not transfer it to my active account to resolve the issue, even if I already authorized it. All the phone calls were recorded, and XXXX history is still there. 

With the next charge cycle coming, I would like to request to transfer to close my balance, and waived the interest charge. They would not allow me the chance to submit the documents with explanation thru emails, as I am doing now, I have to resort to you. And the default history will hurt my XXXX XXXX. 

Thank you very much.

2023-02-22,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem with a purchase shown on your statement","Overcharged for something you did purchase with the card","On XX/XX/2022, I purchased a set of XXXX XXXX and 3rd Generation XXXX from an in-store location in XXXX XXXX ( see receipt no. XXXX ). During my transaction, I could not check out with the monthly installment option that was initially requested. The manager assisting me suggested that I purchase the items outright and call the apple card support line to have the transaction converted. I did just so through the apple support chat after the transaction cleared on XX/XX/XXXX. However, the installment plan or balance was not reflected in my wallet app where my previous installments were stored despite seeing the outstanding balance adjustment. 

Concerned that something had gone wrong, I contacted the apple support line again on XX/XX/XXXX and the agent assisting me suggested going back to the store to return the items and re-purchase them under an installment plan. I returned to the store and explained my situation to the check-in person who then directed me to someone who could help. The agent who assisted me was very kind and understanding in my dilemma and processed the refund and re-purchase quickly and efficiently ( see : receipt no. XXXX ). 

As soon as the transaction was complete, the installments instantly showed up in my app where they were supposed to be but my installment balance had increased to {$1300.00} whereas I expected the balance to be {$700.00} ( XXXX + XXXX ) according to my calculations including the previous installment plan outstanding on my account. As I noted all the transactions were still pending, I decided to wait to see if the balance would correct itself when the transactions cleared. When reviewing my XXXX statement, I noticed the XXXX credit had decreased by {$160.00} instead of the {$97.00} my installment plans had equaled out to ( XXXX XXXX : {$19.00}, XXXX XXXX : {$41.00}, XXXX  XXXX XXXX : {$28.00}, Apple XXXX for XXXX : {$7.00} ) for the month. 

I reached out again to an apple card support agent on XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX inquiring about the deduction of the credit. I spoke with XXXX who explained to me that the reason the Apple Card Monthly Installment is still active is because the device was purchased in full and Goldman Sachs manually put the device on installments. Unfortunately, Apple would not have been able to refund it as an installment since it was purchased in full. The installment will remain active because Apple did refund the full amount of the XXXX in the amount of {$440.00} on XX/XX/2022 ; which, to me, sounds suspiciously like being required to pay for the same installment plan twice. When I expressed this and questioned why the refund credit that I received could not be applied to the installment plan it was for, I was not given a definitive answer but received an offer to have my incident escalated ( ref : XXXX ) to the technical team with the hopes of correcting it. I received a phone call from the technical team who stated that there was nothing they could do on their end to close the installment plan but I should speak with Apple, preferably in store to see if they were willing to offer a credit correction to have it removed. 

With this advice in mind, I made a XXXX XXXX appointment to speak with a supervisor at my local store at XXXX XXXX in XXXX , DC. The supervisor there stated that there was nothing to correct as you already received the refund and we have no record of a payment plan although I showed them my bill multiple times and explained that although there was a credit, the amount being deducted was incorrect. The supervisor insisted that my problem wasnt with Apple but Goldman Sachs. Extremely frustrated with such a tedious process, I contacted Apple Card support again by phone and was bounced back and forth multiple times from agent to agent who insisted my issue was with not one office, but another to which I finally requested to speak with a supervisor to attempt to get an actual answer to my issue. After speaking with the supervisor ( I believe his name was XXXX? ) who, while very kind, explained to me that he could not explain the math to me but firmly insisted that although the installment plan was still reflected on my account, it would fall off once the credit on my account was used. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed again that with the last of the credit deducted from my account, the balance outstanding did not coincide with the cost of the current installment plans. I promptly contacted apple support to attempt once again to sort this out. Again, a Goldman Sachs agent stated I should speak with an apple care specialist, not apple card. Put on hold again, I finally spoke with a very kind young woman by the name of XXXX, who was very efficient in investigating my claim. In the end, she and I both agreed that I should have been speaking with Goldman Sachs all along. After connecting me with the right department, I was EXTREMELY grateful to hear her request my permission to remain on the line to help where she could and see this claim to the end. The Goldman Sachs agent we dealt with was also very kind and detailed in her research into this claim. After about 10 minutes of being on hold, she came back to the phone and agreed that I had an outstanding installment plan that I should not have been paying for. However, because the refund was not processed correctly and applied to close the installment plan, it would remain open until the balance was paid because the credit was no longer on my account. To be sure I understood her correctly, I re-capped all that she had told me to which I calmly expressed that while I was not frustrated with her directly, I was indeed frustrated with how this entire situation was handled up until I spoke to her and XXXX and asked that she voice my complaint to a superior because I should not have been held liable for mistakes made on their part despite my attempts to have it corrected. With that, I told her I wanted to pay the balance in full so that my account was clear. 

I was fully content to let the matter drop as long as the rogue installment plan was closeduntil I received a phone call XX/XX/XXXX from an Apple Card supervisor who wanted to follow up about my complaint. She was incredibly dismissive and proceeded to talk over me as I attempted to detail to her my entire situation then kept insisting that I should look at my current statement to see that I do not have an outstanding installment plan to which I repeatedly attempted to explain that I just paid the balance in full over the weekend. Again, she insisted that she could send me a copy of my statement to which I stated that I no longer required her assistance and terminated the phone call.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","DC","20017","","Consent provided","Web",2023-02-22,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6603061,2023

2023-10-05,"Credit card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Fees or interest","Charged too much interest","Apple Card by Goldman Sachs : ***The 1-sentence summary : *** Goldman Sachs charges 30 days of interest when credit card balalnce is paid 1 day late, and this secret interest charge is usury and completely absurd ( especially since their own representatives are unable to explain the exact calculations ). 

***The 5-sentence summary : *** The automatic payment of my credit card bill from Goldman Sachs was scheduled for Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX ( default payment date when enabling automatic payments ). Goldman Sachs emailed me on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX that the automatic payment had failed. I then manually paid my credit card bill -- in full -- within 5 hours after receiving this email notification. However, I was charged interest fees for 30 days instead of what should be a minimal charge ( either 5 hours of interest since I paid 5 hours after Goldman Sachs sent the email on Tuesday, or at most, 3 days of interest since the automatic payment was scheduled for the previous Saturday ). This secret interest charge ( approximately {$150.00} ) by Goldman Sachs is usury and completely absurd ( especially since their own representatives are unable to explain the exact calculations ). 


***The details : *** I have automatic payments set up with Goldman Sachs for the Apple Card . When setting up automatic payments through the Apple Card app, the default option for """" Payment Amount '' is """" Monthly Balance - stop or avoid new interest charges '' and the default option for """" Payment Date '' is """" Due Date - On the last day of every month. '' I chose the above default options when enabling automatic payments ( to be debited from my bank account ). In other words, 100 % payment of full monthly balance on the last day of the month. 

I have had an Apple Card for 4 years, when the product was first introduced by Apple / Goldman Sachs in XXXX. I have had the default payment options selected since that time. 

I have paid 100 % of the monthly balance for 4 years ( via automatic payments ), and have never incurred any interest charges or penalties. 

The credit card balance for XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ) was {$7400.00}. 

The automatic payment of 100 % of the monthly balance ( default payment amount ) was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX ( default payment date ). Goldman Sachs attempted to automatically withdraw {$7200.00} from my bank account on XX/XX/XXXX. I believe the difference between {$7400.00} and {$7200.00} is due to returns, credits, etc. 

Please note that this was a Saturday. 

On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX ( at XXXX ET ), I received an email from """" Apple Card Support '' stating that """" your recent payment was unsuccessful. Your recent payment did not go through because of insufficient funds. The payment that was applied to your account has been reversed. As always, Apple Card will not charge you a fee. However, the bank used to make a payment may charge a fee. Payment Date : XX/XX/XXXX. Payment Amount : {$7200.00}. Bank account ending in : *** [ I have redacted this bank account information. ] I read the above email notification at XXXX ET that same day and immediately called Goldman Sachs to resolve the issue. At XXXX ET ( on XX/XX/XXXX ), I had manually paid the full balance ( {$7200.00} ). The Apple Card app shows that the *automatic* payment was declined on Tuesday, but then immediately shows that the *manual* payment was successfully paid that same day. 

However, I was charged {$140.00} in interest! I asked the Goldman Sachs representative on XX/XX/XXXX to explain the interest charge, and at first, he didn't even realize that I was being charged interest. I had to repeatedly tell him that I was, indeed, charged an interest fee. Then, when he finally realized I was charged the interest fee, he was unable to explain why it was so high or how it was calculated. He submitted a request to have that interest fee reversed. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Goldman Sachs emailed me that the charge would not be reverse. 

I then called Goldman Sachs again on XX/XX/XXXX, and I spoke to a supervisor ( XXXX ). He was unable to explain how the {$140.00} interest was precisely calculated, other than to give me high-level, generalized comments about APR and DPR. 

However, he did tell me that even if I make a payment only *ONE* day late, I will be charged 30 days of interest.

This has put me in a precarious situation, especially given the imminent deadline for my XXXX XXXXXXXX  tuition fee payment. As an XXXX student, this payment is crucial for both my academic pursuits and maintaining my legal status in the United States. 

My total online savings balance, approximately {$51000.00}, is currently inaccessible due to the account lock. Despite numerous attempts to seek assistance from Marcus customer service, the responses received thus far have been unhelpful and lacking in clarity. 

Upon initially opening my account, I diligently provided my citizenship information and Social Security Number, as required. However, I am now being told that additional verification, such as a U.S. driver 's license or state notarized forms, is needed. I inquired about the sufficiency of my passport for verification, as your website indicates that any passport is an acceptable form of identification. Surprisingly, the customer service team has insisted on conducting further reviews and has denied the acceptability of my passport. 

The implications of this account lock are severe, as I am unable to fulfill my financial obligations for the approaching tuition deadline. My education, career, and overall life trajectory are at stake due to the hindrance caused by Marcus ' decision to lock my access to funds rightfully owned by me. 

If Marcus has a policy of not conducting business with non-U.S. citizens or international students, it should have been transparently communicated during the account opening process. Taking my money and subsequently locking my account without reasonable cause creates an appearance of fraudulent activity. 

I urgently request your immediate attention and resolution to unlock my account, allowing me to proceed with the necessary tuition payment. Your cooperation in swiftly addressing this matter is paramount to ensuring the continuity of my education and legal status in the United States.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","IN","466XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-12-08,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7973047,2023

I was then informed the only way to unlock my account was to sign a notarized affidavit and return it to Marcus. They claimed it was mailed to me on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it should arrive in XXXX business days. After 15 days I had not received the affidavit in my mail.

If you are required to provide an opt out notice under 313.10 ( a ), you must provide a clear and conspicuous notice to each of your consumers that accurately explains the right to opt out under that section. The notice must state : ( i ) That you disclose or reserve the right to disclose nonpublic personal information about your consumer to a nonaffiliated third party ; ( ii ) That the consumer has the right to opt out of that disclosure; and ( iii ) A reasonable means by which the consumer may exercise the opt out right. ( 2 ) Examples ( i ) Adequate opt out notice. You provide adequate notice that the consumer can opt out of the disclosure of nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party if you : ( A ) Identify all of the categories of nonpublic personal information that you disclose or reserve the right to disclose, and all of the categories of nonaffiliated third parties to which you disclose the information, as described in 313.6 ( a ) ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) and state that the consumer can opt out of the disclosure of that information; and ( B ) Identify the financial products or services that the consumer obtains from you, either singly or jointly, to which the opt out direction would apply. ( ii ) Reasonable opt out means. You provide a reasonable means to exercise an opt out right if you : ( A ) Designate check-off boxes in a prominent position on the relevant forms with the opt out notice ; ( B ) Include a reply form that includes the address to which the form should be mailed ; or ( C ) Provide an electronic means to opt out, such as a form that can be sent via electronic mail or a process at your web site, if the consumer agrees to the electronic delivery of information ; or ( D ) Provide a toll-free telephone number that consumers may call to opt out. ( iii ) Unreasonable opt out means. You do not provide a reasonable means of opting out if : ( A ) The only means of opting out is for the consumer to write his or her own letter to exercise that opt out right; or ( B ) The only means of opting out as described in any notice subsequent to the initial notice is to use a check-off box that you provided with the initial notice but did not include with the subsequent notice. ( iv ) Specific opt out means. You may require each consumer to opt out through a specific means, as long as that means is reasonable for that consumer. ( b ) Same form as initial notice permitted. You may provide the opt out notice together with or on the same written or electronic form as the initial notice you provide in accordance with 313.4. ( c ) Initial notice required when opt out notice delivered subsequent to initial notice. If you provide the opt out notice later than required for the initial notice in accordance with 313.4, you must also include a copy of the initial notice with the opt out notice in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically. ( d ) Joint relationships. ( 1 ) If two or more consumers jointly obtain a financial product or service from you, you may provide a single opt out notice, unless one or more of those consumers requests a separate opt out notice. Your opt out notice must explain how you will treat an opt out direction by a joint consumer ( as explained in paragraph ( d ) ( 5 ) ( ii ) of this section ). ( 2 ) Any of the joint consumers may exercise the right to opt out. You may either : ( i ) Treat an opt out direction by a joint consumer as applying to all of the associated joint consumers; or ( ii ) Permit each joint consumer to opt out separately. ( 3 ) If you permit each joint consumer to opt out separately, you must permit one of the joint consumers to opt out on behalf of all of the joint consumers. ( 4 ) You may not require all joint consumers to opt out before you implement any opt out direction. ( 5 ) Example. If XXXX and XXXX have a joint credit card account with you and arrange for you to send statements to XXXX 's address, you may do any of the following, but you must explain in your opt out notice which opt out policy you will follow : ( i ) Send a single opt out notice to XXXX 's address, but you must accept an opt out direction from either XXXX or XXXX. ( ii ) Treat an opt out direction by either XXXX or XXXX as applying to the entire account. If you do so, and XXXX opts out, you may not require XXXX to opt out as well before implementing XXXX 's opt out direction. ( iii ) Permit XXXX and XXXX to make different opt out directions. If you do so, ( A ) You must permit XXXX and XXXX to opt out for each other; ( B ) If both opt out, you must permit both to notify you in a single response ( such as on a form or through a telephone call ) ; and ( C ) If XXXX opts out and XXXX does not, you XXXX only disclose nonpublic personal information about XXXX, but not about XXXX and not about XXXX and XXXX jointly. ( XXXX ) Time to comply with opt out. You must comply with a consumer 's opt out direction as soon as reasonably practicable after you receive it. ( f ) Continuing right to opt out. A consumer may exercise the right to opt out at any time. ( g ) Duration of consumer 's opt out direction. ( 1 ) A consumer 's direction to opt out under this section is effective until the consumer revokes it in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically. ( 2 ) When a customer relationship terminates, the customer 's opt out direction continues to apply to the nonpublic personal information that you collected during or related to that relationship. If the individual subsequently establishes a new customer relationship with you, the opt out direction that applied to the former relationship does not apply to the new relationship. ( h ) Delivery. When you are required to deliver an opt out notice by this section, you must deliver it according to 313.9. ( i ) Model privacy form. Pursuant to 313.2 ( a ) of this part, a model privacy form that meets the notice content requirements of this section is included in appendix A of this part.

2023-05-19,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem with a purchase shown on your statement","Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement","My Apple Card, which is a Goldman Sachs Mastercard, denied a refund claim for multiple duplicate charges by the same app within 45 minutes. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX made multiple duplicate charges to my Apple Pay on two occasions now.The first time was on XX/XX/XXXX in which five charges of {$1.00} was charged on my account the same day for their in-app purchase XXXX XXXX XXXX. Unfortunately, I did not see all of the charges in time ( my daughter made them on a shared Family Plan ) and didnt notice before the money was taken from my account. Last week, on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX charged XXXX for in-app purchase XXXX XXXX XXXX, six times in a row from XXXX XXXX  to XXXX XXXX. It also charged in-app purchase XXXX XXXX XXXX  to my account twice for XXXX contacted Apple / Apple Card when I noticed the charges the next day, and tried to dispute them. I reached out for help the only way Apple allowed, through my iPhone wallet, to dispute the charges. An apple support rep via chat verified that we had been fraudulently charged multiple times and made a refund request for the extra charges. My daughter promptly deleted the entire app from her device, believing the app XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX to be fraudulent since theyve done this twice now. 

Both the refund request and the denial review were denied within days. Though two different online Apple support agents agreed that the charges from the game app from the Apple App Store were duplicated many times in error ( or fraudulently ) on two occasions by the same app, their final response was I exhausted all of my options for you. I went ahead and submitted a refund request, however, it was declined. I am so sorry for any inconvenience. Although we're not able to issue a refund for these purchases, I recommend trying with the developer to see if they have any concessions they can provide to make up for the issues. I asked if it was Apple or Apple Card declining to help me and he said both and stated I have checked that with the Apple Card department they will tell you the same, that the charges were ineligible for a refund, however I have one option to help you in this situation. Since the refund was denied from our side, in this case you can go and dispute the charges with your bank, just take in consideration that your account will be disabled and you will have to add another payment method. 

The app developers app support link leads to an error page stating it does not exist and their blog says any app refunds must be handled by Apple Support. I emailed the developer XXXX / XXXX XXXX, but no response has come after an automated response. So, basically theyre just pointing to each other while stating that Im not getting any of my money back. 

This is both fraud and theft and Apple Cards site clearly states : Have peace of mind knowing that the financial institution that issued your Mastercard won't hold you responsible for unauthorized transactions. As a Mastercard cardholder, Zero Liability applies to your purchases made in the store, over the telephone, online, or via a mobile device and ATM transactions. As a cardholder, you will not be held responsible for unauthorized transactions if : You have used reasonable care in protecting your card from loss or theft ; and You promptly reported loss or theft to your financial institution. 
If you believe there has been unauthorized use of your account and you meet the conditions above, rest easy knowing you have the protection of Mastercards Zero Liability promise.

How am I supposed to get a refund if Apple wont help me and this app seems to have no support for its customers? This app in one day on XX/XX/XXXX charged {$130.00} to my account, is there no one that will help me fix this issue?","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","FL","34203","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2023-05-19,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7000612,2023

Despite my repeated attempts to dispute the fraudulent activity and provide evidence of my innocence, I have encountered an alarming level of disregard for my concerns. 

I discovered an unauthorized credit card account under my name with Apple Card/GS Bank USA XXXX I can confirm with utmost certainty that I did not initiate the application process nor provide consent for the card to be opened. This act of identity theft and fraud has not only compromised my personal information but has also had a detrimental impact on my creditworthiness and financial well-being. 

As soon as I became aware of this fraudulent activity, I immediately contacted Apple Card/GS Bank USA 's customer service hotline to report the issue and seek assistance in resolving the matter. To my dismay, I was met with a frustrating series of unhelpful responses, delays, and outright refusal to take appropriate action. The representatives I spoke with seemed dismissive and failed to demonstrate a genuine commitment to rectifying the situation. 

Despite providing detailed information about the fraudulent account, including evidence that it was opened without my knowledge or consent, Apple Card/GS Bank USA has continuously disregarded my pleas for assistance. I have provided documentation, such as copies of my identification, which clearly show that the information used to open the account does not match my own. However, these efforts were met with indifference, and your institution has seemingly ignored the severity and urgency of this matter. 

I am appalled by the lack of urgency and concern displayed by Apple Card/GS Bank USA in addressing this serious matter. As a victim of identity theft and fraudulent credit activity, I expect your institution to prioritize the protection and well-being of your customers. Instead, I have been subjected to a prolonged ordeal, which has caused me significant distress and financial harm. 

I demand that Apple Card/GS Bank USA promptly initiates a thorough investigation into this matter and takes immediate action to close the fraudulent credit card account. Additionally, I insist that all negative marks and erroneous information related to this fraudulent account be expunged from my credit report. Furthermore, I expect compensation for the damages incurred, including any fees, penalties, or financial losses resulting from this incident. 

Failure to address this matter promptly and adequately will leave me with no choice but to escalate this complaint to relevant consumer protection agencies and seek legal recourse to protect my rights and restore my financial reputation. 

I trust that Apple Card/GS Bank USA will take my complaint seriously and act swiftly to rectify this distressing situation. I eagerly await your prompt response and resolution to this matter.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NJ","07052","","Consent provided","Web",2023-06-25,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7165668,2023

2023-06-27,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Trouble using your card","Can't use card to make purchases","The summary of this complaint is about the troubling experience that I am having with the Goldman Sachs administered Apple credit  card. It raises questions about systemic problems about Goldman Sachs account management practices, which are negatively impacting consumers like me. On XX/XX/2023, Goldman Sachs restricted me from making any purchases on my Apple credit card. There was no notification via email, text message, call or mail to let me know that has occurred. The only reason why I became aware of the situation was when I tried to use my Goldman Sachs administered Apple credit card to make a purchase. Based on my online searches, there are many people over the years who have run into similar situations, where Goldman Sachs essentially froze their Apple credit card and where it failed to provide any notification via email, text message, call or mail. Once I became aware of this issue, I contacted Goldman Sachs on XX/XX/2023, to find out what is going on. They stated that it was due to some security issue but that they could not provide me any information for security reasons. Such as what caused the issue or how long it would take to solve the issue. Over the past couple of weeks, I reached out to Goldman Sachs to find out what is going. According to my web searches, there are many others who have had the same experience. In all my years, I have never come across a company as incompetent as Goldman Sachs, in terms of their lack of transparency that they say is in the name of security. One of my XXXX devices was financed on a monthly basis that I put on the Goldman Sachs administered Apple credit card, not knowing of their reputation with such issues until my recent web searches to see if others have had the same type of issue. The response of Goldman Sachs is that they stated in the contract that it is essentially their right to freeze accounts indefinitely and that they are not required to provide me transparency. This is in violation of US Federal, State of XXXX XXXX  ( where Goldman Sachs is based ) and State of XXXX ( where I am based ) consumer protection regulations. Goldman Sachs has failed to provide proper notice and it makes me wonder whether this is perhaps in retaliation for an application of refund for a XXXX XXXX that was less than {$12.00}, which I requested back in XX/XX/2023. Due to their lack of transparency and proper notice unlike other credit card companies, it is hard to know what is going on with the company and whether things have gotten out of control with the way they run their credit card business. As an Apple customer and shareholder, it is troubling to see what is going one with the Apple credit card under Goldman Sachs.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","FL","33172","","Consent provided","Web",2023-06-27,"Closed with non-monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7176766,2023

The balance at closing was {$100000.00} and they closed the account when I started transferring to another bank as their service was horrible. When the account was closed, I received an email letting me know so I called and was told a check was going to mail out to my XXXX Kentucky address even though I had updated my address to my XXXX Florida address but that was OK, that was over 1 week ago. Then I received a letter from Marcus dated XX/XX/XXXX stating the disputed account was closed and to call with questions. I called today, XX/XX/XXXX and after waiting online for over 30 minutes, was finally told that the funds were sent to unclaimed funds and they would check with that area and send out a check now. I asked why this was the case when I was told over a week ago that the funds were being mailed to my XXXX address and the girl just said she didn't know, there wasn't anyone I could talk to and I could wait a couple of days and call back again to see what happened. This is ridiculous and so unfair that I have been waiting for weeks to get my funds and every time I call, I get the run around and wait for at least 30 minutes while the person I speak to who doesn't know anything about my account has to call someone else that tells them to tell me nothing.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","KY","402XX","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2023-02-28,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",6623031,2023

2023-02-15,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Credit reporting","Incorrect information on your report","Account status incorrect","I am writing to file a complaint regarding the XXXX late payment report on my credit report by Goldman Sachs XXXX which I believe was done illegally. I strongly believe that the report is false and caused by issues on Goldman Sachss end. I request that the late payment report be removed from my credit report immediately. 

There are multiple reasons to support my claim. Firstly, I was locked out of my account by Goldman Sachs when I created a new Apple ID/Email address, and they couldnt provide me with a way to access my account online or update my email/Apple ID address on the account. This caused me to miss seeing unauthorized charges made to my account and the ability to update my bank information to pay the account in full and close it. 

Secondly, I paid off the card in full on XX/XX/2022 ( before my Apple ID was changed ), assuming that the card would be at {$0.00}. I canceled all my subscriptions and updated all my payments to other credit cards. However, I kept being charged for subscriptions I did not recognize or that were canceled, XXXX {$24.00}, and Apple.com/bill for {$9.00}, charging me without authorization a total amount of {$34.00} for 7 months ( XXXX ). Since I couldnt access my account, I wasnt aware of these charges, which led to a late payment. 

Thirdly, I reached out to Goldman Sachs via Apple Chat and phone calls on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, explaining that I wanted to access my account. I explained to them that I had switched to a new Apple ID account, but they told me that they couldn't help me update the account. Eventually, I was able to recover my old account through Apple and gain access to the Apple Card portal, but by then, it was too late. I scheduled payment on XX/XX/XXXX via the online portal, and although I told the representative my situation ( on XX/XX/XXXX prior to the 30-day late report ), and since he couldnt help me access the account, I told him that I would try to recover access through Apple and just to note it and not report me because of that circumstance. One day later, payment was scheduled, but they still reported me late. 

I strongly believe that Goldman Sachss negligence in creating a proper portal and system for users has caused me great damage to my financial reports. They have not covered the scenario where users of their credit card may change Apple IDs in the future, and they should offer access or the option to update the email/Apple ID. As a result, I seek the removal of the 30-day late payment report from my credit report.

I do not seek any fee reimbursement, only the removal of the late payment report from my credit report. I believe that this late payment report was made illegally and without proper justification. I would appreciate a prompt resolution to this issue. Please contact me if you require any further information or documentation.

2023-04-07,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem","Problem with personal statement of dispute","Hi, below is the shortened version of my complaint : I am writing to file a complaint regarding my Apple Card account, managed by Goldman Sachs Bank USA. The issue involves inaccurate reporting of late payments and their negative impact on my credit score. 

Issue Overview : - Two 30-day late payment marks were inaccurately reported for XX/XX/XXXX and, most recently, XX/XX/XXXX. 
- A new, unexplained 30-day late payment mark for XX/XX/XXXX. 
- XXXXpoint credit score loss due to these negative marks. 
- Inability of Apple Card representatives and Goldman Sachs Bank USA - Analysts to resolve the issue or provide adequate explanations. 

Background : I have been trying to resolve this issue since XX/XX/XXXX, making multiple calls, submitting disputes, and requesting complaint submissions. Despite repeated assurances from Apple Card representatives that the late payment marks would be removed, the issue persists.

Impact : I am currently six months into a XXXX XXXX, and this situation has caused significant stress and negatively impacted our housing plans and overall credit report. 

Previous Attempts at Resolution : I have contacted Apple Card representatives, level 2 and 3 supervisors, and Goldman Sachs Bank USA Analysts multiple times between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, but the problem has not been resolved. It has worsened with an additional, unexplained late payment mark for XX/XX/XXXX. 

Request for Investigation : I kindly ask that your department investigate this complaint, review the detailed notes and call recordings from my interactions with Apple and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, and correct the inaccuracies on my Apple Card account.

Additional Information : Please note that the first email I received in response to my dispute did not address my complaint about the 30-day late payment mark for XX/XX/XXXX but instead discussed interest charges. 

I can provide detailed notes, email records from Apple showing the late payment notices they sent despite my timely payments, and the email dispute correspondence that continues to deny my dispute. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt and just resolution. 

_______________________________________________ Below is the longer, in-depth detail regarding my complaint : I am writing to request your assistance in a complaint case against Apple Inc. Credit Card due to their negligence in handling my credit reporting issue, which has significantly impacted my credit score, financial standing, and overall well-being.

I would like to complain about the two negative 30-day late marks reported to all three credit bureaus that remain incorrect, and the most recent late mark for XX/XX/XXXX that Goldman Sachs Bank USA XXXX Apple Card sent me an email denying my dispute and removing this incorrect mark for the fifth time. I now have an open dispute once again regarding this incorrect credit report. 

Apple Inc. 's negligent handling of credit reporting and multiple failed attempts to resolve the incorrect 30-day late credit mark since XX/XX/XXXX. 

Potential violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the California Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act ( CCRA ), including inaccurate reporting, negligence, and failure to investigate and correct inaccurate information when notified. 

Severe damages to me resulting from Apple 's actions and negligence, such as a substantial drop in credit score, closure of a credit card account, impacts on home buying plans, and extreme emotional distress during my XXXX XXXX, among other consequences. 

Apple 's negligence since XX/XX/XXXX for misconduct and reckless disregard for my consumer rights, including inadequate customer support and persistent failure to resolve the issue, and an inaccurate internal system that led to many of my disputes returning emails that addressed a completely different issue and refused to remove the negative marks. 

I believe Goldman Sach Bank USA - Apple Card 's actions and lack of appropriate response since XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX XXXX have potentially resulted in violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the California Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act ( CCRA ) regarding my complaint that include : Lower credit score : Erroneous late payment report - Apple 's reporting of a XXXX late payment to credit bureaus, despite my timely payments that were not XXXX late, could be a violation of the FCRA and CCRA, as they require accurate reporting of consumer credit information. 

Potential Bad business practices : Prolonged negative impact on my credit - Apple 's failure to address and correct the erroneous late payment report first XX/XX/XXXX and a second time on XX/XX/XXXX, despite my multiple attempts to resolve the issue since XX/XX/XXXX and still currently now in XX/XX/XXXX, could be considered a violation of the FCRA and CCRA. These acts require creditor agencies and furnishers of information to investigate and correct inaccurate information when notified. 

While the other consequences and damages I have experienced due to the credit reporting issues, such as emotional distress, hardship, pain and suffering, lost opportunities, and punitive damages, are not directly related to violations of the FCRA and CCRA, they support my complaint. 

Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have been experiencing difficulties with getting Apple both not to report me for late payment when the payment had been made and also removing all 30-day late marks from my report. They reported on XX/XX/XXXX and then most recently on XX/XX/XXXX as 30 days late to all three credit bureaus that still appear on my account and were denied to be removed via email on XX/XX/XXXX, despite this being incorrect. 

I submitted monthly disputes and complaints with Apple Card regarding this inaccurate credit report each time. I received a response from Apple Card denying my dispute which allowed the 30-day late marks with the credit unions to remain. The XX/XX/XXXX 30-day mark by Apple Card remains on all three credit reports inaccurately despite my not being late.

Although I continued receiving late payment notices throughout XX/XX/XXXX and called during the dispute multiple times to prevent my credit score from being impacted as my husband and I was planning to buy I house, I was assured that I would not be reported late to the credit bureaus by representatives I still was reported 30 days late to all three bureaus at the end of XX/XX/XXXX inaccurately and remain so until the end of XX/XX/XXXX. 

I am concerned that I was assured multiple times that I would not be reported as the payment on time for the minimum balance was clear. I still received the email and showed on my credit report that Apple Card marked me late by 30 days with all three bureaus despite my payment being seen on my credit card statement and the representatives I spoke to. 

One representative even shared that they thought it was a system error and should be easily fixed as it was clear. Yet, the negative mark remained in XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and a new mark appeared and remains as of XX/XX/XXXX, which is also incorrect. 

This is concerning as I have never been late 30 days on my Apple Card, yet now have been reported late by 30 days to the credit bureaus twice by Goldman Sachs Bank USA XXXX Apple Card, and my credit remains with a negative 30-day mark for XX/XX/XXXX, and my dispute again denied via email on XX/XX/XXXX, for the fifth time despite this being incorrect with multiple complaints and disputes already submitted. 

This ongoing issue since XX/XX/XXXX continues to cause me severe stress and anguish and impact my overall health, as I am six months XXXX  with a XXXX XXXXXXXX as I submit disputes and complaints that are resulting in the continued inaccurate reporting by Apple Card XXXX 

Throughout this process of disputes and complaints about the XX/XX/XXXX late payment notices and then 30-day late marks, I have contacted Apple 's customer support every single month, including XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and most recently, XX/XX/XXXX and multiple times and spoken with several representatives and level 2 and level 3 Apple Card supervisors via phone. Many representatives could see the error, while others argued with me about me being late 30 days when this was untrue and remains to be untrue as I have never paid Apple late by 30 days and have my statements and records to prove it. 

No matter how many supervisors I speak to, Apple representatives I ask for support in solving this with the final notice for the fifth time on XX/XX/XXXX, was still emailed to me, leaving me with the inaccurate XXXX mark on my credit report for XX/XX/XXXX which I did not pay 30 days late. 

Even more concerning is that when I asked about XX/XX/XXXX, most recently this XX/XX/XXXX, the representatives I spoke to could not explain the negative mark and had no notes about it. 

Due to no response via the fifth dispute denied a few days ago, and the sixth dispute in the process alongside multiple complaints about the 30-day mark and this entire reporting of inaccuracies of my credit report that has not resolved the issue, I am submitting this official complaint about Goldman Sachs Bank -Apple Card . 

Most recent update is below as of XX/XX/XXXX : Due to the new XX/XX/XXXX XXXX late mark on all three credit reports and the representatives telling me there was nothing I could do other than put in another complaint and dispute that continues to be fruitless, I decided to email Goldman Sachs Bank USA directly via their corporate investor email address I located online. 

In the email to the Goldman Sachs Bank USA corporate investor, I shared my problem with no resolution, several complaints, and disputes via the Apple card with the two 30-day negative marks placed incorrectly on my credit report that have failed to be resolved since XX/XX/XXXX. 

I explained how the 30-day initial negative mark to all three credit bureaus for XX/XX/XXXX dropped my score by XXXX points. The second negative mark posted a week ago for XX/XX/XXXX by Apple Card dropped my credit score another XXXX points. I expressed how this has not only impacted my credit score and health, but it has also impacted my family 's plans to purchase a house. 

Yet, despite my insistent complaints and disputes, Apple Card refused to remove the negative marks, which I learned through the five emails I received denying my dispute.

In fact, despite my consistent follow-up and supervisor and representatives reporting they were taking detailed notes and pushing it to an internal """" escalation team, '' the XX/XX/XXXX 30-day negative mark was not removed until the end of XX/XX/XXXX, leading to the XXXX drop in my credit score, and both disappointing and appallingly, the 30-day negative mark was immediately replaced with a 30-day negative mark for a new month which is XX/XX/XXXX,. 

In response to the email I sent to the corporate investor Goldman Sachs Bank USA, I received a call from Goldman Sachs Bank USA via an Analyst who contacted me via phone this week. 

During my recent phone conversation with the Goldman Sachs Back USA Analyst, they confirmed that I have a solid payment history with Goldman Sachs and acknowledged that I should not have been reported late for XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX as I had been adamantly making complaints and disputes about since XX/XX/XXXX. 

The Goldman Sachs USA Bank Analyst shared they could see I have never been late 30 days on my Apple Credit Card payment. And although they assured me yesterday that they would do their best to reach out to the Credit Bureau Team at Apple to resolve this, the team training, and remove the negative XX/XX/XXXX mark from my credit report, I am highly concerned. As the new mark appeared for XX/XX/XXXX, immediately after the initial XX/XX/XXXX mark was removed, the same say led to my credit being knocked down further. When I asked the analyst why this had happened for XX/XX/XXXX, immediately replacing the XX/XX/XXXX negative mark that had been reported for months, they could not explain and expressed there were no notes in the system about Apple Card reporting me in XX/XX/XXXX. They shared that when I called, the call was recorded, so I hope this call can be pulled during the investigation to show this is all true and accurate regarding the difficulties leading up to the most recent XX/XX/XXXX inaccurate credit report by Apple Card that currently still remain on my credit report as of today XX/XX/XXXX. 

The Goldman Sachs Bank USA analyst sent me no email confirmation of the work they shared they would do, and I am concerned that, again, this will be another fruitless investigation. The only record I have now is an email from Apple Card on XX/XX/XXXX, again denying my claim to remove the second 30-day mark from XX/XX/XXXX from my credit report. The rest is just supervisors and this analyst who has assured me via phone but has led to no correction of this major problem that now has led to two inaccurate reports on my credit by Apple Card. 

Again, as of today, XX/XX/XXXX, my credit report reflects the 30-day late mark by Apple card that was inaccurate and denied only a few days ago. What was most concerning before the call dropped with the Goldman Sachs Bank USA Analyst was that they could not give me a clear reason why this new XX/XX/XXXX 30-day late mark showed up on my credit reports from Apple Card in the first place. They had no record of who or where it came from internally. I also spoke to an Apple supervisor about this XX/XX/XXXX 30-day late mark on all three credit reports. They also shared that the notes only show XX/XX/XXXX being reported 30 days late as a final response to the """" Apple XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, '' which again is inaccurate despite the XX/XX/XXXX notice I received that denied my dispute of this inaccuracy. Again, I hope the phone records can be pulled with the latest supervisors at Apple Card I spoke to via phone who shared this information with me and shared they would escalate this matter. 

No matter who I speak to, whether Apple Card representatives or supervisors at levels 2 and 3, in addition to this recent call after sending the email to the corporate investors that resulted in the Analyst calling me from Goldman Sachs, no one is sending me confirmation of this terrible error made twice! And no one has been able to explain this new XX/XX/XXXX mark that it appears no one kept a record of, again I hope the analyst call and the supervisor calls can be pulled in addition to all of the notes these past few months of my complaints and disputes to confirm all that I have shared regarding me attempting to resolve this incorrect credit reporting issue that remains. 

Again, although the XX/XX/XXXX mark was removed after months of being on my credit report until XX/XX/XXXX, Apple Card immediately reported me late by 30 days for XX/XX/XXXX, and this still appears on my credit report for all three bureaus and so far as of XX/XX/XXXX, has not been explained although I have asked the notes only reflect the notes that say I am still late by 30-days and denying my claims.

On the call with the Goldman Sachs USA Bank Analyst, when asked about there would be an investigation into how this could happen after I made multiple calls and reached out about the late notices being inaccurate. Eventually, the 30-day late notice on my account admitted the system """" needed to be improved. '' I am adamant that this appears to be more than a simple system problem as I was told detailed notes had been taken since XX/XX/XXXX and until even this month when I called about the newest dispute being denied on XX/XX/XXXX, yet nothing has been changed. In addition, no acknowledgment via email has been made, only denial letters. Thus I am forced to take word of mouth from multiple supervisors on levels 2 and 3 at Apple and this Goldman Sachs Bank Analyst who do not provide me written confirmation of what they are saying. I asked for the records of all of the complaints I have made, and detailed notes were taken via phone regarding my countless complaints and disputes and were told that may not be possible, so I am left making a dispute about these two inaccurate credit reports of marks for 30 days with your department in hopes that you can investigate how this happened, the internal dispute and complaint process and the XXXX XXXX 30 day negative mark that is now on my credit that could not be explained by the Apple Card supervisors nor the Goldman Sachs Bank USA Analyst. 

I am concerned that the two 30-day marks appeared both for XX/XX/XXXX and not a new appearance in XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX XXXXdespite multiple assurances in XXXX from Apple Card representatives ; this was a mistake ; this would be fixed, and yet XX/XX/XXXX, I have the email record of Apple Card again denying my claim to remove that 30-day mark and today is XX/XX/XXXX. 

I am also concerned that I asked Goldman Sach Bank USA Analyst about what they the XXXX loss due to these two incorrect negative marks inaccurately reported to the three bureaus twice, and he shared there was nothing he could do about that problem, although it has continued to be Apple Cards not just once in XXXX but over months even though I made multiple calls, submitted multiple disputes and requested multiple complaints be submitted and despite reassurance, the 30-day mark would be removed, a new negative mark has appeared for XX/XX/XXXX that Apple representatives and supervisors and Goldman Sachs Bank USA Analyst could not explain despite me fighting for my credit not to be impacted since I received the constant late notices starting at 5 days late in XXXX when I was not late. 

I fear that due to negligence, this inaccurate reporting to the credit bureau regarding my payment history will continue, despite my reaching out and assurances from multiple people from different teams, yet as it has been, the problem progresses or stays the same. 

I am reaching out now despite trying to work on this since XXXX because I am in a XXXX XXXXXXXX at 6 months. This most recent negative mark of XX/XX/XXXX reported by Apple Card has been detrimental to me, especially since where it came from and why could not be explained by Apple Card representatives or the Goldman Sach USA Bank Analyst. I am constantly stressed that despite reassurances, this will not be resolved, or a new mark will appear since accurate records are not being reported and missing information regarding XX/XX/XXXX can not, at this time, XX/XX/XXXX, be explained to me. 

I have been told since XX/XX/XXXX this would be fixed. The exclamation department was working on it and yet can show five emails each not only denying my claim but at times not even addressing my claim but something entirely different, like the first notice I received about my dispute talking about interest and not the 30-day late mark I had made the dispute about and reached out about in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Goldman Sachs USA Bank XXXX Apple Card since XX/XX/XXXX has given me assurances and promises that the first 30-day mark would be fixed. Now it is the second negative 30-day mark for XX/XX/XXXX, and I am again being made assurances with nothing in writing. No one has sent me an email confirming this error ; I only have my XX/XX/XXXX, an email stating that my dispute was denied and the report made to the credit unions would remain. w I was trapped in a loop until I personally found the email for Goldman Sachs Bank USA corporate investor team and reached out. Yet, despite this, they could not explain how the XX/XX/XXXX and despite detailed notes from Apple Team members that I was not late, I was still reported negative not once for XX/XX/XXXX but twice when they again Apple Card reported me late inaccurately and despite my asking why no reason can be given as the people tell me no notes about a late XX/XX/XXXX shows in the Apple Card system as of this week. 

I remain very concerned. Despite the Analyst from Goldman Sachs Bank 's assurance yesterday that this will be investigated, I have been told this by Apple Card representatives and level 2 and 3 supervisors since XX/XX/XXXX, and every month I reached out in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. The 30-day late notice has not been resolved, and the XX/XX/XXXX negative mark has not been explained. I only received another denial of my claim on XX/XX/XXXX. This situation has worsened as they again reported me late a second time on a different month and continue to impact my stress levels, our housing plans, my overall credit report, and so much more. 

I hope this complaint can be investigated and your department can pull the detailed notes and call recordings from the calls I made to Apple from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, and yesterday XX/XX/XXXX, via a different number with the Goldman Sachs Bank USA Analyst. 

Please do also note that the first denial emails for my dispute, refusing to correct the inaccuracies on my Apple card for the 30-day late mark for XX/XX/XXXX, resulted in an email on the dispute decision denial that had nothing to do with my complaint or dispute for the 30-day negative mark reported. The first email I received discussed interest when I kept calling to report the late notices in XX/XX/XXXX and share that I was not late. 

I can provide detailed notes and email records from Apple showing the late notices they sent despite my payments, and the email dispute correspondence continues to deny my dispute.

Recently Apple gave me a credit line increase towards the end of XXXX. I made a payment of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and noticed on my app there was no available balance after the payment was made. I call in to to customer service to see whats going on and was notified my card was closed. I replied why is my card closed, I am making my payments on time, the rep said I dont have that info all I know is your card is closed. I proceeded to ask for a Supervisor and was transferred over to XXXX. We began discussing this situation and the supervisor said this must be an error and he see that I have done nothing wrong and stated he will forward request to have this situation reviewed as this account/card should not have been closed. The manger said there are no notes indicating that communication was sent to me either by email or Mail notifying me that my account was closed and providing no reason for closure. The supervisor also stated the card company charged me twice for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX for payment reversal which should have only be charged once. I received a call a few days later from some one from the customer advocate team at Apple Card or Goldman Sachs stating the card is closed and to refer to the cards terms and conditions. I replied there are several things listed in the cards terms and conditions, how can I know what I specifically have done by reading terms and conditions. I proceeded to explain that per their company policy I should have been provided either an email or Mail listing why the account was closed, and since this did not happen she needed to provide me the reason and not tell me to read terms and conditions to try and quests why my card was closed. I am making payments on time and in large amounts. She replied she doesnt have this information. I tried to login to obtain my credit card or account number in the Apple app and they have taken away my access so I can even list the card or account number to refer in this complaint. I decided to call Apple Card again today, XX/XX/XXXX and requested to speak to another supervisor, name is XXXX, she also reviews this closure and said I did nothing wrong, and can not understand why this was dont to me, said this was completely mishandled and she is raising this to all her supervisors. She said the card was closed for abuse and failure to comply with terms. I asked for prof of how I failed to comply and what specifically I did, she said she reviewed my history and there is nothing I did. If anything improper was done it would be from the credit card themselves. They should not punish their cardholders that did no wrong doing, no investigation was done to support anything. 

This is ridiculous no one from the credit card send me any written communication, they have no idea themselves why the card was closed and now closing the card on my credit report has significantly impacted my credit score. This closure is completely unjust and is only at the fault of this credit card institution. This is documented by two separate supervisors from the credit card company. They can simply pull this up.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","CA","90048","","Consent provided","Web",2023-04-08,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6812873,2023

They already stated they were refunding the source bank account.

I have taken this complaint to multiple agencies who all send me back to you as the regulator of that lame excuse for a bank. Do I really need to file a lawsuit to get them to follow through on what they specifically agreed to do in the original complaint? 

Perhaps you can recommend a news media outlet that might be able to get the word out about the games this bank is playing and why the banking system itself is not on solid ground?

I did not receive any statements or communication from Goldman Sachs or Apple regarding this and was completely shocked since I returned all what I purchased for full refund. 
I called the number on the credit report and spoke to the Goldman Sachs representative, who informed me that the balance due reflects daily cash/cash back that Goldman Sachs gave me for the purchase. I have never received anything from Goldman Sachs or Apple and never had the access to the cash back they are referring to or have knowledge about. I did not redeem anything and like all normal credit cards require did not approve any redemption. The account Goldman Sachs claims the cash was sent to, has never been setup and I do not use Apple wallet where the Goldman Sachs claims the cash will show up. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a payment to pay the balance on the card which I do not owe to them and I have no access to the cash they referring to. Also, on the top of that, I have a late payment on my credit report that significantly affected my nearly perfect score.

2023-06-02,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Opening an account","Confusing or missing disclosures","Marcus by Goldman Sachs advertises a referral bonus of 1.00 % for both an existing deposit customer and a new customer when a new customer opens an Online Savings Account ( OSA ) or CD. Existing customers are provided with a link that can be sent via text or email to a prospective customer. 

"""" As an existing Marcus deposits customer, you can receive a promotional Marcus Referred Rate ( defined below ) on all of your Marcus Online Savings Account ( XXXX ) ( each an OSA ) after a New Customer ( defined below ) opens a new OSA or Certificate of Deposit ( CD ) using your unique referral link ( a Successful Referral ). '' This is seemingly a deceptive practice when an existing customer without an OSA and only a CD ( for example ) is provided with this link to refer a new customer given that the referral rate bonus of 1.00 % can not be provided on a CD. The link should not be offered if an existing customer does not have an OSA. Also, for a new customer that intends to only open a CD, the 1.00 % bonus will not apply or in the case of a new customer that opens both a CD and an OSA, the referral bonus will not apply for a new customer that opens a CD first and then opens an OSA shortly thereafter because Marcus then views that person as an existing customer ( because the CD was opened first, which was my scenario ). 

On XX/XX/, I was referred to Marcus by an existing customer ( my fiance ) that owns CDs and OSAs with Marcus. I opened the CD on XX/XX/ before the OSA. When attempting to use the referral link on XXXX  to open the OSA during the same online session, I was provided with an error message that the referral bonus would not apply because I was not a """" new customer '' ( having opened the CD first ). On XXXX I sent a referral link ( as an existing customer ) to my younger brother who used the link to open an OSA as a new Marcus customer. He advised me on XX/XX/ that he opened a new OSA with the referral link and I immediately opened a new OSA with Marcus in hopes that I would receive the 1.00 % referral bonus too. At the time of opening an OSA, I only had a CD with Marcus ( opened on XXXX  ). On XXXX I called into Marcus because my fiance and I did not see the referral bonus added to our accounts. The representative, XXXX, asked me for the unique code from the referral link in order to have a supervisor apply the referral bonus to my fiance 's OSA ( based on activity from XX/XX/ ). She advised me that she could not add the referral bonus as a """" new customer '' to my OSA since I had opened the CD first and was not deemed a """" new customer '' for the purposes of receiving the bonus on my OSA as a new customer. I asked her about receiving the bonus on my OSA as an existing customer because my younger brother opened a new OSA on XXXX She advised that my brother would need to call into Marcus with the unique code from the referral link in order to have the referral bonus manually added to my OSA ( also opened on XXXX  ). My brother advised that he saw the referral bonus on his end but was told by Marcus ( via phone call ) that the referral rate could not be manually added to my OSA because the bonus is added automatically. I called back to Marcus to see if the referral bonus could manually be added to my OSA ( as an existing customer bonus ). I was told by a supervisor that since my OSA was not open and active at the time my brother had opened his OSA as a new customer ( albeit later that same day, which seems a ridiculous technicality ) that the referral bonus for an existing customer could not be applied ( see Terms language below under the General section ). 

This language is in the full terms for the offer. One must click on a link to see the additional terms of the offer which are not made apparent in the larger advertisement and is in my opinion deceptive to new and existing customers. 

"""" TMarcus by Goldman Sachs Referral Program Terms Existing Customers As an existing Marcus deposits customer, you can receive a promotional Marcus Referred Rate ( defined below ) on all of your Marcus Online Savings Account ( s ) ( each an OSA ) after a New Customer ( defined below ) opens a new OSA or Certificate of Deposit ( CD ) using your unique referral link ( a Successful Referral ). Adding a joint owner to an existing OSA will not count as a Successful Referral. Your unique referral link will be accessible in the Marcus Referred Center. You can access the Marcus Referred Center by logging in and selecting Marcus Referred in the menu at the upper right corner of any page. 

After a Successful Referral, all of your existing OSAs will earn a promotional Annual Percentage Yield ( APY ) increase that is a specific percentage higher than the stated APY available at www.marcus.com for a period of 3 months ( Marcus Referred Rate ). To determine the APY increase for the applicable 3-month period, please refer to the Online Savings Account Referral Page [ marcus.com/referrals ]. If the Successful Referral occurs before XXXX XXXX XXXX, you will receive the APY increase reflected on the Online Savings Account Referral Page on the day of the Successful Referral. If the Successful Referral occurs after XXXX XXXX XXXX, you will receive the APY increase reflected on the Online Savings Account Referral Page on the day after the Successful Referral. You must have an OSA at the time of a Successful Referral to earn a Marcus Referred Rate. New OSAs opened after a Successful Referral may also be eligible for a Marcus Referred Rate, as further detailed in the General section below. A Marcus Referred Rate will automatically start within 1 business day following a Successful Referral.

Jointly owned OSAs may receive a Marcus Referred Rate through the Successful Referral of any account owner, but individual Marcus Referred Rate maximums still apply. The dates associated with the 3-month period of a Marcus Referred Rate on your individually owned OSAs may differ from that on your jointly owned OSAs. 

New Customers If you have not had a Marcus OSA or CD in the last 12 months ( a New Customer ), you can receive a Marcus Referred Rate when you use an existing customers unique referral link to open a new OSA. You will receive your Marcus Referred Rate for a period of 3 months, within 1 business day of when your OSA is opened using an existing customers unique referral link. New jointly owned OSAs opened through a unique referral link can receive a Marcus Referred Rate, provided that all account owners at the time of account opening are New Customers. The Marcus Referred Rate earned as a New Customer will not count towards your referral maximums ( see General section below for more information regarding maximums ). 

By using an existing customers unique referral link to open an account, you acknowledge that the customer whose unique referral link you use may know that you opened a Marcus account and when. If you wish to avoid this, do not sign up for a Marcus account through a unique referral link.

General To receive a Marcus Referred Rate, your OSAs must be open and in good standing. CDs are not eligible to receive any APY promotional rates through Marcus Referred. You can see the status of all your earned Marcus Referred Rates in the Marcus Referred Center at any time. 

If you open new OSAs while any of your existing OSAs are receiving a Marcus Referred Rate, we will apply the Marcus Referred Rate to your new OSAs. You will receive the Marcus Referred Rate through the latest expiration date of your then-current Marcus Referred Rate.

If any joint owner of a jointly owned OSA is currently receiving a Marcus Referred Rate when a new jointly owned OSA is opened, that jointly owned OSA will receive a Marcus Referred Rate through the latest expiration date of an active Marcus Referred Rate associated with any one joint owner under the terms and conditions of that Promotional Rate. Subsequent Marcus Referred Rates earned by any joint owner will result in an accrual of additional 3-month Marcus Referred Rates, each to be applied consecutively. The Successful Referral of any one owner on a jointly owned OSA will only be applied towards that owners individual Marcus Referred Rate maximum.

Marcus Referred Rates may only be combined with other non-referral promotional offers available to Marcus customers. You can earn a maximum combined total of 5 Marcus Referred Rates under these Referral Program Terms and any other Marcus by Goldman Sachs referral programs in each calendar year. If you are already receiving a Marcus Referred Rate, the next Marcus Referred Rate you earn will begin on the day after your current Marcus Referred Rate expires based on the terms and conditions of that Marcus Referred Rate. Only one Marcus Referred Rate will be applied to your OSAs at any given time. Upon expiration of a Marcus Referred Rate, the APY on your OSA will automatically revert to the stated APY available at www.marcus.com. APY may change at any time, before or after an account is opened. 

Any other Marcus by Goldman Sachs referral programs will be treated as a separate referral program with separate terms, offer period, and/or benefits. We reserve the right to revoke or modify this program at any time without notice, which could include changing the type of promotion awarded or the amount of any promotional rate. If we determine that you have engaged in or plan to engage in abuse or gaming in connection with this offer, you will not be eligible for this offer. '' I asked for the supervisor to log this matter as a """" complaint '' and to follow-up based on Marcus ' error resolution process. The supervisor responded that there would be no follow-up because Marcus is following the terms and conditions of the offer and that no further action was necessary.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","VA","22903","","Consent provided","Web",2023-06-02,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7057034,2023

The original balance, which was {$510.00}, which was due on the XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, I am a full-time XXXXt and do not want to be against the wall in credit card payments so close to the end of my XXXX XXXX, so I like to pay off my cards on time and have never had any issues with any of my cards until now. As I said, I paid {$390.00} towards the card but was charged twice instead of just once due to a glitch on behalf of Apple 's system. My original thought was that since XXXX times two is well over the XXXX dollar balance on the card, on top of the fact that only ONE of the XXXX dollar payments was taken off the credit, I believed that Apple would recognize the error and waiver the payment and forget about it, I was wrong to assume this. Come Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I got an email stating that my bank account balance was at an overdrawn number of - {$340.00} and some change ; my balance before I made the payment to Apple was in the mid XXXX, so there was no reason for my account to be overdrawn after making ONE payment of XXXX dollars. I first asked for full reimbursement of the XXXX dollars, and I was told I would receive the XXXX dollars that I was falsely charged, and this did happen today, XX/XX/XXXX ; I see that I received the XXXX dollars in my bank account, but my card balance is XXXX dollars over what it should be, meaning that the XXXX dollars I never paid for but was charged for anyways have suddenly magically appeared into existence.

2023-06-05,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Managing an account","Deposits and withdrawals","My complaint pertains to the new Apple Savings product offered by Goldman Sachs. From the day I opened the account on XX/XX/2023 to the time I called customer service on XX/XX/XXXX to close the account, I have faced almost every single scenario featured in this XXXX XXXX XXXX -- plus more. 

XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Parallels to the XXXX include XXXX inability to verify external checking accounts for more than one week, moving money leading to """" vanished '' money for more than one week, several deposits/withdrawals taking more than than two weeks to close, being told that I couldn't have """" triangular '' transactions and yet blocking me from making the proper transactions ... and inconsistent advice at almost every turn. Impacts that I personally experienced mirror those faced by the customers featured in the XXXX article, such as : having to borrow against our XXXX for an emergency expense and missing the cutoff for final bids on a multiple-bid house because our good-faith deposit check was stuck. We were almost grateful our bid was not accepted, since the money is STILL stuck at Goldman Sachs three weeks later .... 

In all of these cases, Goldman Sachs made absolutely no effort to provide updates on pending actions or activities that required my inputs or approvals -- no phone calls or emails, no websites offering status updates, no requests for authorization. When I pro-actively reached to Goldman Sachs out via text or hotline, the customer service reps provided inconsistent, non-existent or incorrect advice. During several of these calls, I received the impression that had I not called, account verifications or ACH transactions would have just stayed """" pending '' and would not have moved at all. 

On several occasions, when I requested status updates on pending or missing transactions, they literally had no records -- in spite of these same transactions being clearly documented by the sending or receiving external banks. 

There are two additional examples of poor actions, even beyond the examples reported in the XXXX : XXXX ) After two-plus weeks and multiple attempts to withdraw {$110000.00} from Apple Savings to an external checking account ( initially requested on XX/XX/XXXX ) the deposit finally landed in my external checking account the morning of XX/XX/XXXX. But by the afternoon, the money was GONE from the external checking account. According to the external bank, the deposit had been reversed by Goldman Sachs... for no reason and no notice. Goldman Sachs didn't inform me or ask for my approval. When I called Goldman Sachs, the customer service rep had no record of this transaction. 

2 ) I promptly requested to close my account on XX/XX/XXXX. The customer service rep informed me that the account would be closed and I would be getting a check of the balance in the mail via XXXX. She specifically told me that I need to be home to sign, etc. I asked whether I could just transfer the money and she said, No, it has to be a paper check. Three days later, my online Apple Savings dashboard shows no indication of being closed. The deposit still shows the full amount. When I spoke to two customer service reps about this, both of them informed me that what I needed to do is """" transfer out '' the money before I can close the account. They literally had no record that I had already requested an account closure, and moreover, that the first customer service rep that told me that they had to send me a check. If I had only been able to transfer the money in the first place, I wouldn't have requested closing the account. As of XX/XX/XXXX, money that I had wanted to withdraw on XX/XX/XXXX is still in the Apple Savings account.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NY","12309","","Consent provided","Web",2023-06-05,"Closed with non-monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7064870,2023

It took a prior CFPB complaint to bring the fraudulent charges to closure. The card was closed. 

Subsequently, the credit card was charged for the apple cash rewards related to the fraudulent items that were resolved/reversed. Goldman Sachs position is I'm responsible for the balance of these fraudulent rewards despite repeated calls with Fraud Unit to have the apple cash rewards reversed and resolved. I have proven I have no access to these rewards via apple cash as they assert. 

I have worked through the process Goldman Sachs requested. Apple has confirmed there is no ability to recover my apple id account after working the matter. I have talked with Apple Cash team and reviewed the fact I have no access nor did I benefit from the apple cash credited to me from the fraudulent transactions. The Goldman Sachs Level 2 Fraud Unit has corresponded with both Apple and Apple Cash representatives while I was on the line. In early XXXX, I was told the matter would be escalated to a responsible manager who could finally resolve the matter. I was told I should not be responsible for the rewards balance given I have no access to those rewards/nor benefited from them. 

I called Goldman Sachs today to confirm the resolution and was again told I was responsible for the balance and could again escalate the matter for review. I have made repeated calls to resolve this matter since XX/XX/XXXX and have exhausted my ability to communicate with Goldman Sachs effectively. 

Please assist me with resolution of the outstanding balance on this closed account, wholly related to cash rewards on fraudulent transactions.

Marcus locked my account when I initiated this transfer. I called to find out the issue and kept being hung up on. I finally spoke to a supervisor, and they said they would send me an affidavit to verify my identity.

I could not physically make it into a store to notarize because my husband works and uses the car, plus I have XXXX XXXX to take care of. After I got the affidavit notarized, I paid {$30.00} for certified mail so they could receive it the next day. My tracking receipt shows they received the form on XX/XX/2023. When I called to confirm, they said it was under review and would take seven business days to review. I called back on XX/XX/2023, and was on hold for three hours. Then the representative said it was notarized by someone in Texas and needed to be done in North Carolina, where I reside. I told her I paid {$25.00} for a virtual video service to get this done. Hence, people work from virtually anywhere to help get documents notarized asap if they can not physically make it to a location. She said they would be sending out another form so it could be done in NC. I then asked to close my account. After all, I am no longer interested in banking with a bank holding my money hostage for over a month, all because I wanted to transfer some of my funds. She said she would send a code to the phone number I have on file to close the account. The code never came, and she asked if I had an alternate number. I told her I only use one number on my account and have not had issues using this number in the past for my account. She put me on hold for another hour and said my account was in review to be closed, but I will need to call back for updates.

Over the years I have made dozens of deposits and withdrawals on the account. I have maintained the same email address since opening the account, and updated my phone number on the account on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX, when my new cell provider could not carry over my new number. I updated my home address when I moved to my new home in XXXX of last year, however I also still own the prior address. But none of these changes caused an issue. 

This year on XX/XX/XXXX I made two deposits of {$5000.00} from my XXXX XXXX, and XXXX  accounts to Marcus by Goldman Sachs. On XX/XX/XXXX I again made two {$5000.00} deposits from XXXX XXXX and XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I also made a withdrawal of {$1000.00} to my XXXX XXXX by XXXX XXXX account that was cleared. All of these accounts are in my name, and my name alone, and I was the one who linked them as external transfers. On XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to make another withdrawal to XXXX XXXX, but then without warning on XX/XX/XXXX when I tried to log in to my account I was informed my account was locked, and that withdrawal never made it to XXXX XXXX. 

I have recordings of every phone call I made totaling over 3 hours of time. The first phone call lasted 18 minutes and 25 seconds, and I was told by """" XXXX '' that I would get a call back in 2 minutes to sort the account. But that was a lie because that call never came, so I called back again, and the customer service hung up on me saying they couldn't hear. Then the next one lasted 1 hour, 5 minutes and 15 seconds. One of the representatives on this call kept telling me that he could only send me a pin to my old phone number that was removed from the account on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX or 2 year prior. All of the calls have gone in circles like this over the last week. 

I have spent hours trying to regain access to my account and I am still locked out from over {$19000.00} of my money and nobody will provide me with any answers of why or what happened to cause this. I've offered every possible means of verifying my identity through video call, email, phone, home address... I offered to upload my IDs, drivers license, DoD ID, passport, DD214... but they said the only way is to mail a notarized affidavit of identity, so I immediately printed it out on the XXXX, filled it out, and paid for a notary and mailed it from XXXX, Georgia to their po box they gave me in XXXX on the same day. This should take maybe 2 to 3 days to get to the destination. 

That was 7 days ago, and I called again today and they still have not received it and will not answer my questions. Now a letter with my most sensitive information is out there, and I can only hope that it does not end up in the wrong hands or I will truly have a identity crisis. And over {$19000.00} of my money is stuck in this account, and nobody will tell me why. 

I reached out to the only email I could find and was told they could not help and to call the same number that is not providing any information. 

I have dozens of different bank accounts, and have been banking for over 2 decades. I have even served in the military and obtained a security clearance handling classified documents ... and never once in my life have I been told to mail in a notarized affidavit of identity or ever heard of one. 

This is the year XXXX, and this multi billion dollar bank relies on physical mail to a po box as their only way of identifying a 5 year customer.

Almost every month, I have paid my balance in full, and throughout each month, I have made multiple payments because my spending well exceeds my limit. On average, I have spent anywhere between {$3000.00} and $ XXXX each month. During calendar year XXXX, my spending was {$23000.00} with no missed or late payments. 

Today, out of the blue, I received an email from GS indicating my credit limit was reduced from {$1500.00} to {$500.00}, thus essentially rendering the card useless. The explanation given was a charge of and delinquency with other creditors. 

Several weeks ago I discovered a handful of accounts on my credit report that do not belong to me ; they were fraudulently opened without my knowledge or consent using an old home address in Maryland. I have since disputed these accounts with the CRAs and completed an identity theft report. 

When I contacted GS to explain the situation, i was told there was nothing that could be done to reinstate my credit limit because these decisions are made by AI, and everything is automated.

My account history with GS has been exemplary. The credit limit prior to being reduced was rather modest at {$1500.00}, and it represented a very minuscule risk to GS, especially given my proven payment history. There is very minimal risk of default. Moreover, it was implied that if the balance on my Apple Card was higher than it was at the time the limit was decreased, GS would likely not have decreased it or would have only decreased it by an amount just above the balance.

2023-07-21,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Managing an account","Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed","Marcus By Goldman Sachs has been holding {$20000.00} of my money hostage from me since XX/XX/2023. It has been an extremely awful experience having a savings account with Marcus by Goldman Sachs as their policies and customer service are absolutely atrocious and flat out embarrassing. On XX/XX/2023, I transferred funds from my external account into my savings account at Marcus by Goldman Sachs to fund the account. A few days later, I decided to transfer the funds out of the account via ACH transfer to another bank that I have in my name. Goldman Sachs did not like this. Apparently, I had to of had the funds in the Marcus by Goldman Sachs account for 90 days or more before I could touch the funds and move it elsewhere, which is outrageous and no other bank has this policy. Please keep in mind that this policy was not disclosed to me or else I would have not transferred the funds there in the first place had I would have known it would be locked into the savings account for 90 days or more. This is just the beginning Marcus by Goldman Sachs AUTHORIZED an ACH transfer to my other bank account whilst on the phone with me on XX/XX/XXXX, without saying anything about a 90-day hold on my funds. At that point, the same day, Marcus by Goldman Sachs blocked my access to my account right after I requested it. I called again to report my account access was restricted and to ask why. Marcus by Goldman Sachs stated that the funds MUST return to the bank account where the funds came from I had communicated with them that this action was not possible due to the fact that the account the funds came from, I closed.. Which was the entire reason for the transfer from my bank to Marcus by Goldman Sachs in the first place. At this point, Im expressing to them that the account at the originating banks institution is closed and the funds will not be accepted by that bank. A lot of bank and forth calling between the two banks. I would call the bank where the funds came from and they would express that the account is closed and they will not accept the funds from Marcus by Goldman Sachs. I would then call Marcus by Goldman Sachs and they would persist that the funds would have no choice but to be sent back to the originating bank and that well have to see for ourselves if the bank rejects the funds, after I told them several times and even did a 3-way call with both banks on the phone where they confirmed the funds would be rejected!! Marcus by Goldman Sachs proceeded to submit an ACH transfer to the originating bank against my wishes anyways. Two days later, XX/XX/XXXX, the funds were in fact rejected by the originating bank and sent back to Marcus by Goldman Sachs. Marcus by Goldman Sachs then told me that once the funds were retuned to them, they would issue a check to me or allow me to transfer the funds to another bank ( the other bank I had attempted to transfer the funds to in the first place! ). I then had to wait 5-7 business days for a review on my account to be complete and I was told at the end of the review that I would be receiving a check within 7-10 business days. I was slightly relieved after a full month of trying to retrieve my funds, it seemed like the finish line was finally in sight. Nope, they sent a check to the originating bank instead of me even though the originating bank asked them to not because they would refuse and destroy the check!!!!! Not only did Marcus by Goldman Sachs go against both the originating banks wishes as well as mine, they in fact sent the check to the incorrect address in a different state!! They did not even have the common decency to send the check to the originating bank. They are sloppy and do not care at all whatsoever. I waited 15 business days for the check to be delivered to the originating bank in hopes that they would just forward it to me, instead the check was sent to the incorrect address and also, even if the check was received by the originating bank, the check would have been destroyed as they do not accept physical checks as per their policy, which means I waited another 15 business days for a check to not only not get delivered to the correct address, but not delivered at all Marcus by Goldman Sachs lied and stated that the originating bank stated they wanted a check to be sent to them so that they can forward the check to me.. ( Which makes XXXX sense because Marcus by Goldman Sachs could have just sent me the check directly ).. The originating bank stated several times to Marcus by Goldman Sachs that they never requested a check to be mailed to them and they do not know where Marcus by Goldman Sachs got this information from. They stated that they made this information up as the originating bank will not communicate with Marcus by Goldman Sachs without me on the phone, which means Marcus by Goldman Sachs lied to me when they said that the reason why the sent both the ( Rejected ) ACH transfer and ( Rejected ) check, was because the originating bank requested it. The story gets worse. I contacted Marcus by Goldman Sachs and stay on hold for ridiculous 45-50 minutes every day just to be told We need you to contact your external bank to receive the funds.. How does that make sense!!!!! I already have contacted them! We together, all three of us were on the phone when the originating bank told you several times that they were not going to accept the funds!!! After each and every call, Marcus by Goldman Sachs triggers an account review in order to figure out a way to give me my money back and at the end of each review they do not do anything different besides say we recommend you contact the external bank they clearly do not care!!!! The external bank can not do ANYTHING!!

Marcus by Goldman Sachs has these extremely long and depressing account review periods where they review your account for 5-7 business days every single time something happens. I call and tell them that the funds will be rejected 5-7 business day review, with no information from customer service throughout that time, they dont even answer my phone calls. I call and tell them that the funds were promised to be returned to me via check or transfer/wire 5-7 business day review, with no information from customer service throughout that time, they dont even answer my phone calls. I call and tell them that I would prefer a transfer/wire instead of a wire 5-7 business day review, with no information from customer service throughout that time, they dont even answer my phone calls. I call and tell them that the check was sent to the incorrect address 5-7 business day review, with no information from customer service throughout that time, they dont even answer my phone calls. I call and tell them that the check is still not in my possession 5-7 business day review, with no information from customer service throughout that time, they dont even answer my phone calls. I call and tell them that it has been a full two months with no progress or effort from Marcus by Goldman Sachs to give me my funds back 5-7 business day review, with no information from customer service throughout that time, they dont even answer my phone calls. I call and tell them that I still dont have my funds and that the originating bank will not accept a check nor transfer, they wont accept any money because my account is closed and they recommended to Goldman Sachs to give me my funds in a check 5-7 business day review, with no information from customer service throughout that time, they dont even answer my phone calls.

I call and let them know that my account has two credit cards as well in the app that I need access to pay and that have nothing to do with the savings accounts that are now closed. They are unwilling to unlock my online access. I am afraid that I wont be able to pay my credit cards on time! This is a nightmare!!! Not only have I lost a savings account for absolutely no reason, but I may lose two credit cards as well! They allow me to log in once every few days and then whenever they decide to do an account review, they re-lock my online access and I cant access my credit cards and pay them again!!!!! 

They told me they would issue me a check if the originating bank did not accept the check, now all of a sudden, they are unwilling to do so! They lied again! I dont even know where my money is! I am struggling and have been for two full months. I have been struggling to pay rent, I have accrued credit card debt, I am struggling to pay my bills, I am struggling to pay my college tuition. I even had to sell my car to get enough equity to keep myself from drowning. 
To this day I still do not have my funds I so desperately need and deserve. I never did anything wrong besides just trying to do a normal ACH transfer to another bank account in my name!!!!!!! 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I told Marcus by Goldman Sachs that at this point I am going to get an attorney and sue because I have endured an extreme amount of stress, XXXX and XXXX.. 5-7 business day review, with no information from customer service throughout that time, they dont even answer my phone calls.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NJ","070XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-07-21,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7284338,2023

They've provided no actual notification that my account was being locked ( no mail, email, or phone notification ) and finally informed me that they force closed my account and that I have to contact them again in the future or status and to request my funds. 

Monday, XX/XX/2023 : I placed three external transfer requests. I had XXXX savings accounts with XXXX, and have been a customer for years. Two of the three transfers completed successfully to my local bank, and to an external account that was verified and validated via my online account on XXXX. The third, and largest of the transfers ( over {$6000.00} ) was blocked even though I received email notifications that it was processing. 

Tuesday, XX/XX/2023 : I tried to login to my online XXXX account to check on the status of the third transfer. I was notified while trying to login that my account was temporarily locked and I needed to call their savings customer support. I called and spoke with an agent after XXXX CT who verified my account and identity and said they needed to transfer me to a specialist to get my online account access back. They placed me on hold multiple times, then said a specialist would call me back in XXXX minutes. Hours went by, no call. Nobody from XXXX reached out to me. 

Wednesday, XX/XX/2023 : I contacted my local bank where I was transferring the money to and spoke with a banker. I asked if they could see any incoming transfers but unfortunately informed me that they would be able to see it when I could see it. Dead end. Nothing they could do to help me to try to get my money from XXXX or confirm if the actual transfer was still processing. 

Thursday, XX/XX/2023 : I tried to access my online account on XXXX via desktop computer and mobile device ( XXXX ). Still locked out of my account. I again called customer support for their savings ( the number they directed me to call ) and was again connected with an agent. After verifying my identity and account, they transferred me to a specialist. This time the specialist talked with me and informed me that XXXX was force closing my account with no reason provided. Any open transfer requests would be blocked, and I can not get access back to my online account. The specialist couldn't confirm how much money was in my account ( even though I know the exact amount that they owe me ). They suggested I call back in XXXX business days to check status of my account closure and to verbally verify my address for them to issue a check to me for the money they owe me from my savings account. 

I am sitting in limbo with over {$6000.00} of mine sitting at Marcus by Goldman Sachs that they've blocked me from withdrawing and even preventing me from viewing my online account to confirm they haven't sent my money elsewhere. The agents and specialists on the phone continue to place me on hold, transfer me to someone else who has no information, or suggest they will call me back when they do not fulfill that promise. They can not confirm how much money is in my account, can't provide me access back to my online account, can't confirm why my account was temporarily blocked or now being forced closed, and they've provided no actual communication via email, mail, phone or otherwise to notify me of any of this activity. They've been an incredibly easy company to deposit money and paychecks into and gain a competitive savings rate but it feels highly suspicious and almost intentional to create methods to prevent me from withdrawing my money from my savings accounts with them.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","MN","551XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-07-27,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7313415,2023

This year apple has instituted a new rule where they are requiring me to have cell phone service with one of the 3 """" Major '' cell providers ( XXXX & XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX ) in order to finance it on the apple card. I use a XXXX XXXX, a smaller cell provider, and because of that Apple is not allowing me to finance this year 's XXXX on my existing apple card. 
My complaint is that my financial relationship with Apple / Goldman Saks for the Apple Card and my ability to purchase a phone directly from Apple to finance on their card should be agnostic to the provider I choose for my cell phone. Especially when the only 3 providers they are requiring are all much more expensive than my current provider. There are many customers in the US that rely on lower cost cell phone providers ( called MVNOs ) and use Apple 's 0 % financing to make the total monthly cost of cell phone bills ( cost of phone + cell service ) lower than larger carrier. 

I feel that Apple is now colluding with the larger cell phone providers in an effort to force customers to leave the lower cost providers and re-join the higher cost major providers. I'm not sure if the providers are pushing Apple towards this or if it Apple 's own decision but eitherway I believe it should not be permitted.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","MA","015XX","","Consent provided","Web",2023-09-19,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7575264,2023

2023-05-01,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem when making payments","Problem during payment process","My name is XXXX XXXX. I don't know why my name is showing as XXXX XXXX. 

I have had the GM Mastercard for over 20 years. During that time with that creditor, I never had a problem with scheduled payments online. Only recently, ( within the last year or so ) the card was changed to Marcus by Goldman Sachs. I haven't used the card much at all. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I charged a charitable contribution of {$51.00} on the card. On XX/XX/XXXX, I scheduled an online payment of {$51.00} for XX/XX/XXXX to pay the full balance due, one day before the due date. Unlike other credit cards for which I schedule payments online, this card does not provide a confirmation number when the payment is scheduled. I received an email on XX/XX/XXXX, confirming that the payment was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX and I saved that email as my proof of payment. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I charged {$500.00} and then on XX/XX/XXXX, I charged {$7700.00} for travel to XXXX XXXX. I planned to pay these charges in full before the due date to avoid interest or penalties. I have SEVERAL credit cards, and always schedule payments online on or before the due date. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Marcus that my payment ( which should have been paid on XX/XX/XXXX ) was past due. I called the company immediately and told them that I scheduled the payment online, and that I had an email from them confirming that payment was scheduled. They told me that the payment was cancelled. I never cancelled the payment. Also, I never received any notice from the company that my scheduled payment had been cancelled. 

As a matter of fact, when I went online to see what had transpired, there was no record at all of my original scheduled payment of {$51.00} OR the cancellation. 

On that first phone call ( I believe on ) XX/XX/XXXX, the representatives assured me that all penalties and fees would be credited. They said they could immediately credit {$25.00} of the {$35.00} interest fee ; however, they would certainly get a full refund to me for the full {$35.00} interest. A review of the recorded conversation will prove this to be true. 

To verify that the full interest of {$35.00} was credited, I went online again, as I felt that I could no longer trust Marcus by Goldman Sachs to handle my scheduled online payments. At that time, the rep told me that they could not credit my full interest charge, as it is there policy. I was furious, since I never canceled my payment, and I indicated to them that I think the credit card was participating in fraudulent activites. Why did I not receive any confirmation that my {$51.00} was canceled. As of today, I have paid my entire balance with Marcus by Goldman Sachs. Here is the remedy I am seeking : 1 ) I want a full credit for the interest charged to my account -- every XXXX. I do not feel I should pay {$10.00} when I scheduled the payment online and it was cancelled through no fault of my own. 
2 ) I want assurances that there will be no future interest or penalties charged to my account for the money I have now paid in full. 
3 ) I want to review the recording of the initial call I made to them on XX/XX/XXXX when the representative told me that all would be credited. The company has advised that they can not provide me with that recorded call. 
4 ) I want an apology from the credit card company and a full explanation as to how the cancellation happened. 

Marcus by Goldman Sachs seems to be engaging in a scheme to charge people interest. I believe that either the cancellation of my {$51.00} was the result of a hack to their system or that the company intentionally cancelled that payment so as to incur interest on my balance. 

Most seniors on a fixed income would not be able to pay an entire multi-thousand dollar balance in full. They would likely be saddled with additional interest charges that would mount on their revolving balance, starting with the ( fraudulently ) canceled payment of {$51.00}. This may be a scheme to take advantage of senior citizens. 

I challenge you to look at my record -- check out my credit rating. I pay my credit cards in full monthly. Why would I cancel a payment to Marcus by Goldman Sachs when I had such a large balance on that card for the first time ever?

2023-02-21,"Credit card or prepaid card","General-purpose credit card or charge card","Problem with a purchase shown on your statement","Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement","On XX/XX/2022, I purchased a truck accessory from a company advertising on social media for a vehicle I had just purchased, and as part of a larger plan to establish self-employment income and reduce my reliance on disability. The rack was advertised by XXXX XXXX, who is owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX, NY. 



I was primarily searching for a rack capable of carrying a few hundred pounds above the bed for longer materials or recreational equipment, and built in storage to expand the range of tools I could bring with me when I could begin working for myself. 



I selected this XXXX XXXX rack and cargo chest combination because the customer service team was very responsive pre-purchase, and because it was advertised as being capable of carrying a 350lbs dynamic load or hold a 700lbs static load with tonneau brackets. This is at just 51lbs weight for the rack itself. That performance for the weight was what led me to believe the high cost was justified. Seemed too good to pass up. Possibly, too good to be true in hindsight. 


XXXX offered discounts that I qualify for and they are an American business advertising American made goods that are advertised as made with local, American materials from Western New York. 


I also purchased their cargo chests for the rack which were advertised as weather-resistant and shown as good storage for a wide variety of items. 


These boxes show no attempt in any way to make them weather resistant. 
For one, the sides overlap the top panel of the box ; there is a reason the roofs of our homes extend past the walls. Every hardware penetration in the box is open. No nylon washers, no rubber, no gaskets. The panels are all joined metal-to-metal, and when fully assembled, the boxes keep out very little moisture or dirt. Light is visible between the door and body of the cabinets. The lids are affixed to the boxes using painted, basic 3-hole hinges. These were attached with bolts and nuts for some reason, which leaves raised hardware exposed on top of the boxes. The latches and lock for the boxes are not labeled for outdoor use, nor are they weather resistant. 


The option from XXXX XXXX is considerably more expensive than competitive products I had been considering like ; the XXXX XXXX Series Aluminum rack, XXXX truck bed boxes ( not available at the time ), and various options available from the dealer. One of the reasons a significantly higher weight capacity was not attractive ; the truck would be an earlier limitation on total payload than the rack. 


It became apparent almost immediately upon using the rack, that it would not be capable of meeting any claimed performances. It was obviously dangerous to continue its use. 


After a particularly bad experience with one of the first loads of lumber I carried, I contacted the company to relay my experience and ask if they would take the rack back. The company has a strict zero return policy ( I now see why ), and was generally combative and dismissive in their initial response. 


I decided to pursue a chargeback through my credit card provider ( Apple Card via Goldman Sachs Bank ), as this seemed to me like a clear case of someone trying to sell overpriced goods to under-educated consumers online. I requested a chargeback based on the product being far below the expected quality based on the companies description and product pricing. 


Goldman Sachs Bank initially sided with the seller based on criteria that seemed unrelated to my claims. 


The seller provided some token responses to my claims that can be summarized as """" nuh uh! '' There was no evidence provided by the seller to refute any of my points. In some cases, their responses contained provable falsehoods, like their cargo boxes being made """" weather resistant ''. They relied primarily on their success at preventing any previous returns to justify preventing a refund on this purchase. 


I offered a few times to work with the seller while simultaneously working with Goldman Sachs Bank to cancel the transaction. 


Communication from XXXX XXXX during this process was at times combative and dismissive. There were instances peppered in of polite service as I tried to salvage some usability from this product. 


At one point, the company implied I would not be able to pursue any warranty claims, despite the product being within their warranty coverage. I forwarded this to Goldman Sachs Bank as evidence the seller is not upholding their end of the purchase. They have reached the same conclusion two additional times, despite more and more evidence that the company is not responding to me and has preemptively denied me warranty service. 

I sent a final attempt at communication to a different employee at the company whose social media showed them to be a current employee at a senior level. 


In this communication, I provided a clear case for what I was trying to accomplish. I shared a substantial amount of evidence showing failures of the product, and offered to concede the cost of shipping for a partial return. 


This was met with zero response. 


I forwarded that communication to GSB, along with a written summary detailing my experience to date. I included communications from the seller, and accounts from other customers who had also noted the rapid failure and seemingly dubious claims made by the company. Many of these accounts from other customers documented examples of where XXXX had clearly chosen lowest-possible-cost options in production that led to almost immediate failure of either parts of products or entire products. 

It is important to note here, that I have repeatedly offered throughout this process to provide video evidence to GSB, as seeing the product in motion makes it abundantly clear that this is not what it is claimed to be. 

Again, my request for a chargeback was denied with no specific responses to my evidence or summary given. Just the same exact response I had received the previous 2 times. Whenever I requested evidence regarding the request ( all three requests in total ), they kept sending the same initial response from the seller, which was primarily baseless dismissal of each of my documented problems with the product. 

When I was calling to discuss options that might lead to a resolution, I did mention filing a CFPB complaint as my planned next step. The representative on the phone quickly transferred me to a manager, and they began a sort of scripted phone process that seemed to lead nowhere ultimately. It concluded with the manager informing me that my appeal had been re-opened. As of time of writing this, it has not been re-opened and I have not been credited. 



I believe that GSB is choosing to deny a legitimate complaint simply because they can. I do not believe they have fairly addressed my claim, and their limited forms of evidence accepted are preventing a more convincing contest of this charge. Goldman Sachs Bank has established a recent history of denying customer claims despite their legitimacy and veracity. I wish I had researched more before doing business with them. 



I want other consumers to know about the experience I have had with this seller and Goldman Sachs Bank. I hope that, should this be made public, any readers have found it informative and chose not to do business with Goldman Sachs Bank until they change their behavior toward their customers. 



In addition to this complaint, I have submitted a request for assistance from the NY State AG 's Office in dealing with the seller.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","OR","970XX","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2023-02-21,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",6597344,2023

2023-06-22,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","Domestic (US) money transfer","Money was not available when promised","","I have two complaints against Marcus by Goldman Sachs, both have to do with their money wire transfers. We kept most of our savings for the escrow and down payment on a house purchase in Marcus, and because of their actions, put the timing and purchase of the house in jeopardy. We had to undertake extra efforts to avoid this. 

First, our earnest money down ( EMD ) payment of {$22000.00} was due XX/XX/XXXX. We saw that they advertise on their website when you select """" Deposit or transfer '' from the account page, that when you click on """" Click here to learn about your options, '' it clearly states, """" Request by ( for same Business Day processing ) ... XXXX XXXX  ET '' for a wire transfer. The fine print states, """" An Online Wire transfer scheduled before XXXX XXXX ET on a business day should be processed within one hour, otherwise it will be processed the next business day. '' ( document attached ). This is similar to the information they publicly display on their public website, which displays the same table stating there are no limits on wire request amounts by phone, and requests made prior to XXXX will be processed the same business day : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  It was very clear that it is advertising if you submit a wire transfer request by XXXX ET, there is same business day processing. This is stated multiple places on their website. We submitted our request on Friday, XXXX around XXXX XXXX -- -three days before the EMD was due. I requested that it could be escalated as urgent for processing, which they agreed. When I realized at XXXX, the money had not been transferred I called Marcus . They informed me that wire transfers can take 1-3 business days and they could not guarantee that it would go out to the title company by the due date of Monday ( next business day ). I learned from a call the next day that when they put me on hold at XXXX yesterday on Friday, only then had they attempted to contact the title company to verify the deposit -- -past the closing time of the title company. Even when I called back on Monday XXXX and had a Marcus representative call the title company with me on the line ( and they confirmed the account ), they would not guarantee the money would be processed on that day. Later in the afternoon luckily it did process. However, their claim of same business day processing is, frankly, fraud. 

We then needed to wire transfer the rest of the down payment and closing costs ( approx. {$140000.00} ) to the title company for closing. We initiated this a week early ( Friday, XX/XX/XXXX ) anticipating their delays. However, later that day they informed us that they denied the wire transfer and would not send the money to the title company, despite having previously approved the EMD payment to the same title company, to the same account. They explicitly told us that it was Marcus ' policy NOT to say why they deny transfers. No where on the transfer information pages I have linked to ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ) and attached does it say that they will deny transfers to title companies. Our only option was to transfer the money to an external checking account before using a different bank to wire it to the title company. Since this was after XXXX, any wire transfer would not be processed until at earliest Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX. Not only was this inconvenient, if the transfer took 2 or 3 business days, this would put our closing in jeopardy. I again had to call on Tuesday to ensure that they would process the transfer in time. Perhaps this was a coincidence, but the wire transfer was initiated to my external checking directly after I called to check on the status. 

Marcus by Goldman Sachs publicly displays information that states clearly they will process wire transfers in a certain time, but when you initiate this they only then point you to their official policies ( XXXX XXXX XXXXf ) which directly conflict with the information they advertise. This is fraud.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","MD","20910","","Consent provided","Web",2023-06-22,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",7155248,2023

I opened two disputes XXXX & XXXX ( re-open of initial dispute ). The next paragraph is a summary and basic details about the purchase for context, then I return to this dispute with Goldman Sachs Bank in the subsequent paragraphs. 

I purchased a coffee maker advertised on XXXX, using a mobile web platform on XX/XX/XXXX, for {$490.00} ( U.S ). I realized at the time of purchase the company was based in XXXX, but assumed the merchandise would be designed for XXXX XXXX since the product promotion was on XXXXXXXX ( U.S ), and provided screenshots to support these facts. On XX/XX/XXXX I reached out to the merchant after the thought crossed my mind to check and make sure the machine worked in the U.S. I provided copies of the email exchange to Goldman Sachs Bank as did the merchant. It wasn't until XX/XX/XXXX the merchant informed me by email the machine would not work in XXXX XXXX unless I purchase a voltage converter ( expense and scary ). The product is not designed to work in XXXX XXXX ( wrong voltage ) and the cord will not work outlets in the U.S. The merchant informed be after additional emails ( also provided to Goldman Sachs Bank ) I was expected to send the machine back at my own expense and if there was any damage to the box or machine upon arrival back in XXXX, they would not provide a refund. None of this information or their XXXX page or mobile website. I felt like this was a scam. Why advertise a product in the U.S. that is not designed for or work in the market? I felt the merchant expected me to take all the risk. I already paid {$80.00} to ship the machine to the U.S ( purchase price was {$410.00} + {$80.00} shipping ), now I would pay to ship it back, plus the merchant would decide if I receive any refund once they receive the machine back? The merchant is already shady advertising products in the U.S. markets that don't work, so why should I trust them? I advised the merchant I was disputing the transaction. 

I opened my original dispute XXXX or around XX/XX/XXXX ( date of provisional adjustment of {$490.00} ). To open the dispute, the interaction was minimal, I did everything through the mobile app in a couple of clicks. I received several email updates from Goldman Sachs Bank during the dispute investigation which provided status updates and indicated that I would be contacted and allowed to submit evidence prior to any resolution. On XX/XX/XXXX I was informed """" we're reviewing the merchant 's response for your Apple Card transaction dispute. '' The email again says I will have a chance to submit and they will reach out when its time. Three days later, XX/XX/XXXX I was informed, """" your Apple Card transaction dispute investigation is complete and the merchant charge ( s ) will remain on your account. '' It goes on to say, """" The evidence received shows that no credit is due because you agreed to the merchant 's terms and condition at the time of purchase. '' I was angry! Not only did Goldman 's Sachs Bank not follow their own process ( allowing me to submit evidence ), but the justification doesn't make sense to me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the Apple Card/Goldman Sachs Bank support and tried to reopen ther dispute, but I was told they could not do that, but they would create a new dispute and reference the original, so XXXX was created. Again I asked when opening and through subsequent emails when would I be able to submit my evidence? I was advised to submit through the mobile app chat function, then after calling customer support and being transferred multiple times, I was told the supervisor could help ( 4th person ). She advised me she could not and I would receive an email. I was finally able to submit my evidence ( a PDF document ) via chat in XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I finally received an email from Apple Card requesting I submit my evidence, which I did submit the exact same file again. Today, XX/XX/XXXX ; I was notified """" Your Apple Card transaction dispute investigation is complete and the merchant charge ( s ) will remain on your account. '' The reason provided, """" We further investigated the dispute and reviewed any additional information that may have been provided. Based on our review, the original decision will remain because there is no evidence to substantiate the claim. '' I wholeheartedly disagree with this decision and do not feel like the dispute process was followed ( first case ) and """" there is no evidence to substantiate the claim '' is factually incorrect ( within the context of use ). I have attached the PDF file I submitted to Goldman Sachs Bank. 

I would also like to point out that since I have contacted the merchant they have removed all references for the product from their U.S. XXXX account and their website. The only evidence I can provide are the screenshots I took of XXXX and of their mobile website earlier in the case.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","IL","60187","","Consent provided","Web",2023-05-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6925074,2023

This was done without my consent, as prior settings were set to be approved by myself on my adult account. There were no payment methods listed on the minor account. When speaking to the XXXX representative, I was informed that once a person turns XXXX, the setting has to be manually changed back. This was never discussed with me aside from the note of that when a child is XXXX they get a teen account and can make purchases. What is frustrating is that there is no notification of the account being changed to Teen status and is ultimately done without consent of the adult holding the account. The Apple credit card allowed multiple charges over 50 different charges totaling up to {$13000.00} without it signaling any type of suspicious activity nor notifying the adult. The XXXX ID that made the purchases is noted as a XXXX year old and is not listed as an authorized user on the Apple Credit card. 
The Apple credit card also allowed the charges to exceed the credit charge limit of {$12000.00}.

Following up with previous complaints. 

The bank replied and said on XX/XX/XXXX they will close my account and transfer my money, but didn't receive my call backs on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX so they can not proceed. However, this is not the truth. 

The bank is lying. I did receive emails regarding calling back to the bank, and I called back. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, someone claimed to be a supervisor refused to close my account and denied the fact that I have requested to change my address in my previous calls. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, I have requested to send XXXX to my new address.

XX/XX/XXXX, I called again, a XXXX in fraud department answered my call. XXXX refused to tell me anything regarding my account ( including when will the XXXX be sent out ) and also rejected to look into my issue. I made zero progress in this call too. 

The bank is not resolving my issue as they said!!! I did call back but none of the people answered the phone proceeded to close my account, which is in the contrary to their replies. They are lying. I've attached my records of calling the bank on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX.

I asked him about this and he finally told me that while at his fathers for the weekend, a friend of his fathers son, who is a couple years older than my son played on his account on his iPad, and this child made the purchases. This happened a few wks prior as well, for the same amount 5 times in a row. For a total of XXXX, which I disputed WHILE the purchase was still pending, the Apple rep I spoke with told me she would cancel it and I would not be charged, my refund request was denied and I was ultimately charged by Apple. When I called I was told they could not do anything about it, and to dispute it with my credit card company. They did not offer any resolution on how to make changes to the accounts where this would not happen again. This DID happened again, 2-3 wks later. Again on a weekend my son was with his father. But, AFTER I had set up in app purchase ask to buy which would send me a text that allowed me to approve or deny purchases. Somehow my child was still able to make purchases. I disputed the first charges of XXXX on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX through my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX card which was charged, they did not send me any paperwork asking for further information from me at all. Ultimately I was charged due to Confirmation showing no cancellation per policy was received, for XXXX, and 2 out of 5 charges have been added back to my account as of today XX/XX/XXXX. I removed all payment forms from my Apple account to avoid this in the future. Daily Cash credit you receive from spending with your Apple Card, you CAN NOT remove from your account, so my son spent all that as well. The second purchase was made through my Apple credit card. Which I had to add back to my account to pay for my subway ride to work. Both Apple and the Apple credit card denied all but 1 charge. The charge made at XXXXXXXX XXXX on XXXX it must have shown it was Made from a different device. My child is an XXXX XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX. He was not authorized to make purchases by me, I did not approve the request, and anybody looking at the charges ( the amounts and made several times in a row ) can make an obvious observation that no parent approved {$1500.00} in charges for an online game. My son is not mentally capable of understanding the concept of how much money was spent. Due to being XXXX XXXX XXXX, but also due to being XXXX. The XXXX purchases were either transferred or and items purchased with them transferred within the game to this other child. Besides Apple already having a class action lawsuit due to this exact issue, the enormous amount of complaints you can look up on any forum due to this exact issue, my sons XXXX account has been disabled, meaning I am being forced to pay a crazy amount of money for an account that cant be accessed, my son did not receive items or XXXX that I am paying for, How can this even be okay??? for a minor special needs child to be held responsible for making purchases he was not authorized to make and that he did not gain from. Is that not the definition of FRAUD!?? Apple had no part in stopping them from happening after even several disputes and complaints. XXXX XXXXXXXX gave me the reason for not removing charges as no proof of account cancellation. What account? My Apple account? Or the XXXX account, which has been disabled, but they never sent me anything asking me about it.. Apple refunded me for 1 charge of XXXX, I did not receive any reasons for why or why not. I think that shows If the last charge for XXXX was found to be fraudulent, ( the only 1 that was made alone at XXXXXXXX XXXX  on a Tuesday out of a total of 14 charges for XXXX ) that the other 8 made on XX/XX/XXXX 8 times in a row only weeks after I disputed 5 charges of XXXX 5 times in a row while still pending AND made from an XXXX XXXX XXXX iCloud account, ( which Im pretty sure an XXXX XXXX XXXX is not even allowed to authorize purchases, I know I never gave my permission ) those charges are ALL fraudulent!!!!

There was not warning pop-up saying, """" are you sure you want to make XXXX payments on XX/XX/XXXX? '' or something similar. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I noticed that my bank account was now overdrawn which drew my attention to the scheduled payment error. I immediately contacted Apple Card Services over the phone and was told they could not issue me a refund on their end and to call my bank. I knew this was not going to resolve the issue but I called XXXX anyway. They said that it was on the vendor ( Apple Card ) to return the funds upon my request. I know it is possible for creditors to return funds to clients because something similar happened to me with XXXX XXXX  and they returned my money into my account the next business day. I then contacted Apple Card via the text feature the same day. This costumer service representative XXXX XXXX XXXX finally created a refund request for me saying it would take 3-10 business days. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I reached out again to get an update since I was not sent a confirmation email that a refund request was sent, so I had no evidence to confirm whether an actual refund request was made.

Was transferred three times to different representatives after telling each of them that I was told I should have my refund by today, XX/XX/XXXX. I was ultimately informed that it would take up to 14 calendar days from the date of issuing the request, ( which I know is 10 business days. ) I asked if this was the company policy to take such a substantial amount of time to resolve costumer issues, this is not a small company, it is Goldman Sachs.

I notified Apple immediately upon discovering the fraud, contacted the stores when I would receive notification that a purchase was ready for pickup, filed a report with the FTC and cooperated as best I could with providing the limited information I had on the thieves. 

I have been working with more than 30 different Level 1 customer service representatives and had to finally only request to speak with someone at a supervisory level due to the poor service, confusion and advice. I have a spreadsheet with all 19 of the dispute files and when any action was taken. I have since discovered that more purchases were attempted but had been caught before completed. On the disputes the back and forth on resolved, reasserted, and denied has been a trued nightmare. Invariably one person would make a determination and then another would countermand. It has been XXXX months of constant chaos and frustration. Each and every time I think we are nearing the end another issue arises and am told it will be ANOTHER XXXX  days till resolved. There is no dispute whatsoever that I did not make a single purchase as I live about XXXX miles from where the fraudulent action was initiated, my ethnicity and name do not mesh with the diversity of those picking up the items and no request for confirmation of proof I made the purchases at the time of a person not listed on my account picked up the electronics. 

During the hack they were also able to download funds from my associated debit card to Apple Cash and promptly cashed it out at a Florida XXXX. I immediately contacted my bank who within a 3 hour time period confirmed that this was fraud, that I was not involved and refunded the missing money to my bank account. 

The guidance I received over these last 4 months has been frightening to say the least. One representative actually thought it would be a great idea if XXXX sent me the credit balance on my account ( due to the dispute credits ) and I could then pay one of the outstanding installment accounts on one of the fraudulent IPhone purchases ( there were XXXX phones purchased ).. I quickly dismissed this advice as being non-nonsensical which prompted me to ask for a supervisor to intercede. 

I have had some better advice and service from a few of the supervisors who promise to make it their personal mission to get this corrected once and for all. However, when they have cleared one case off the docket some XXXX puts it back on. 

I have specifically been irate that during these XXXX months, the purchases have been reported to the Credit Bureau which of course has had a negative impact on my credit rating. Debt to income way out of whack with just under {$9000.00} in fraudulent purchases. When I contacted customer service to express my frustration that obvious fraudulent purchases would be reported under my name. I received a nasty email in return stating that because the balances showed up on my billing statement they were correct in reporting the information. Totally dismissed the fact that this was fraud. Credit rating directly equates to the cost of money for me. I have had to delay the purchase of a new vehicle as I would be charged much higher interest rates that I would have afforded under my true rating.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","MN","557XX","Older American","Consent provided","Web",2023-10-11,"Closed with monetary relief","Yes","N/A",7684385,2023

On XX/XX/XXXX an interest payment was added to the balance in the amount of {$210.00}. 
The current balance of the account was now {$160000.00}. 
I made the decision to move this full amount into another bank ( XXXX ) that provided a higher yield XXXX vs XXXX. The new savings account was opened XX/XX/XXXX and they deposited micro deposits to verify my ownership of the Apple Savings prior to moving the funds. After verifying, the new higher yield savings account ( XXXX ) attempted to fund the account the balance {$160000.00} which resulted in Apple locking my Apple Savings account. I contacted Apple Savings and they said they were unable to process this transfer and that I would only be able to withdraw all funds back to my original account that funded my Apple Savings ( XXXX ). Apple Savings unblocked my account and I was able to submit a request to withdraw my funds. 
I processed this withdrawal request on XX/XX/2023. The Apple Savings account immediately went to a {$0.00} balance. Since the withdrawal request, I now randomly get notifications from Apple Savings saying my account has been locked/restricted which require me to be on hold for hours a time, being passed off from agent to agent while they investigate with no real explanation as to why my account is being locked. 
As far as Apple Savings is concerned per my last call on XX/XX/XXXX, the money from the XX/XX/XXXX withdrawal request has left their system. It's now XX/XX/XXXX and the receiving bank ( XXXX  ) still sees no trace of the ACH being sent from Apple Savings ( I contacted them to verify ).

In response, they locked my account and told me to call a number to unlock the account. I called Marcus and they first asking probing questions regarding what I was going to do with the money I was transferring and why I was moving it out of Marcus ( I was planning on leaving a substantial amount in the account ). They said that they are going to cancel the transfer and that I could not transfer the money to my linked account or I should just keep it in the Marcus account. 
I also tried to set up an account with my Mother in Law and it was a nightmare. Went through all the steps and they said that she was denied for not apparent reason as she has great credit and other bank accounts with no issues ( I believe because we were taking advantage of their promotion giving the referring person and the new customer an enter 1 % on the account ) They finally said I could transfer money only into the same account I transferred it in but I would have to start the process again from the beginning. They were acting like it was their money and that they would tell me how I should be using it.

She used the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs for this transaction. She was told that the course trial period would start on XX/XX/XXXX for a period of 15 days during which she could cancel the enrollment and receive a full refund ( see XXXX  Agreement.pdf attachment ) if she did not find the course worth the investment. During the trial period my wife realized that she was given misleading information regarding number of online and in-person classes when she signed up for the course on XX/XX/XXXX. Subsequently, she submitted a Fee Refund form at the local XXXX  center ( see XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and was told to wait for 14 days for refund processing. 

She came back to the XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and by XX/XX/XXXX when we didnt see a refund on our credit card, I filed a dispute with the Apple Card Customer Care at Goldman Sachs and {$1500.00} amount was provisionally credited to my account ( see Apple Card Dispute XX/XX/XXXX Email.pdf attachment ). I was told that Apple Card Customer Care at Goldman Sachs would follow up with the vendor ( XXXX  ) and get back to me. No other information or documentation was requested by the Apple Card Customer Care at Goldman Sachs On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Apple Card Customer Care at Goldman Sachs that they were reviewing the merchant response and that no additional action was required from me at this time ( see Apple Card Dispute XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Apple Card Customer Care at Goldman Sachs to provide any correspondence with the merchant such as emails or letters that would help support my case for disputing the charge ( see Apple Card Dispute XXXX XXXX attachment ). I sent a response to the email on XX/XX/XXXX ( see Response to Apple Card Dispute XXXX XXXX attachment ) and the text of the email is pasted below === Hello Apple Card Support Team, Attached are the two documents - one for the XXXX contract and the other for the cancellation. The dates are in DD/MM/YY format and the amount is charged by XXXX  subsidiary Think and Learn Private Limited. In the XXXX contract document on the first page which was signed on XX/XX/XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ), it clearly states that the customer is entitled for a full refund if the contract is cancelled by XX/XX/XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) at the center. The cancellation form that was filled and submitted at the center has a date of XX/XX/XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ). The amount charged is XXXX XXXX XXXX that is equivalent to {$1500.00} based on the exchange rate on that day. Please let me know if there is any additional information needed to refund the amount. XXXX customer service has been terrible and they have not initiated any refunds even after contacting them several times. 

Thanks, XXXX XXXX === On XX/XX/XXXX I saw that the {$1500.00} charge ( that was provisionally removed on XX/XX/XXXX ) was added back. An email from the Apple Card Customer Care at Goldman Sachs contained the following statement The evidence we received shows that you did not cancel your purchase prior to the processing date. There was no documentation attached with the email ( see Apple Card Dispute XX/XX/XXXX XXXX attachment ) When I called the customer support team at XXXX in the afternoon on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire more about the decision for taking a decision in support of the vendor and thereby denying the refund, I was not given any new information. They told me that they received documentation from the vendor but did not provide any dates or details. I reiterated the content I sent in the email and told them the vendor had still not reached out to me after repeated inquiries for the refund. I was on the call with the Apple Card Customer Care at Goldman Sachs for almost an hour and escalated it to the next level but did not get a convincing answer for why the charge was added back to my account when I provided compelling supporting evidence. 

As a customer, I am at a loss if the credit card company decides to side with the vendor when there is evidence that I followed all the procedures to receive a full refund.

On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Goldman Sachs to request a trace of the wire as it had not been received.The representative with whom I spoke with stated the wire had not been initiated because the original call was dropped ( our call had been dropped however, XXXX did phone me right back ). I provided wire instruction again to a supervisor only to be told that they would not wire to a third party and I could only wire to myself or an escrow company.

She stated she could do a transfer to my linked account and offered to expedite it. Stressed and concerned, I told her I was not comfortable with that until I spoke with a representative with XXXX XXXX to confirm this was a viable option. I called XXXX XXXX and spoke with an agent that said that is a good option however, it may take up to 3 days to be able to tranfer out once funds were received. 
I then called XXXX XXXX on the evening of XX/XX/2023 and spoke with a supervisor name XXXX. XXXX told me that he could not expedite a transfer to my linked account and that additional verifications were going to be required but could not tell me what those verifications were. I then requested all of my funds ( {$250000.00} ) be transferred to my linked account and to please close my account as i was no longer confident I could ever get my money out of my account.

I am at my wits end and terrified I can not get my life savings out of this bank. My purchase is being held up. 
I did go online and request a transfer online however, I am limited to {$120000.00} so multiple requests will need to be made all taking XXXX days.

There is nothing stopping this merchant from sending damaged goods and then only offering a refund in the form of store credit to be used with them. I told Goldman Sachs this in the latest appeal and today they ruled in favor of the merchant again.

I already filed a complaint because for some reason, Apple would not process my application so that I could get a card. It took me submitting an application like 59 times just to get them to run my credit. I finally was able to get the card, once they ran my credit and have used it for well over a year. Sometimes less, because of other circumstances. I asked for a credit limit increase, and have been denied countless of times even though the info that they send me stating why indicates a score of 790-810. I was told in XXXX to use the card regularly for a month because if we dont automatically granXXXX an increase after 6-months, we usually do so after a year and because I didnt start using the card right away. I did so, and was told the same thing. I asked for them to perform an underwriting, which they agreed to do which might require them rerunning my credit, which I was informed about via email, but was told by a rep that they would not review it and there decision is final. As I tried to explain to the reps, if they did what they said they were going to do, a soft look would have told them that I have a card thats 4X the limit of the Apple Card, which is why I dont get the balance up high that often. Also, when I do go that high, it takes a month or so for my score to go back up because it results in a XXXX point hit to my score. I think they are picking on me because of my name and what my name means. So, them asking me to permanently lower my score to get a limit increase is biases, especially when I have mad more than the minimum payment and well before my due dates. From what I gather from searching the web, this isnt a common problem that I am experiencing. This is prejudice at its core and is something that the average XXXX customer isnt dealing with.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","CA","90003","","Consent provided","Web",2023-03-18,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6709692,2023

2023-03-11,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Credit reporting","Incorrect information on your report","Information belongs to someone else","Back in XXXX of XXXX, I received a phone call from a collections agency and they told me that I owed XXXX XXXX XXXX {$46000.00}. They tried to get me to disclose my method of payment over the phone for the amount owed. I had no clue on what they were talking about and wasn't sure if it was a scammer trying to take money from me. After speaking to the agent for quite some time, I quickly realized that the XXXX XXXX released {$50000.00} to someone identifying themselves as being me. Still unconvinced, I ended up signing up for XXXX ( that my wife previously added me to but I never received the email invite ), and I saw that my credit score went from being an XXXX down to a XXXX. To my disbelief, I also ended up seeing other loans that were taken out around the same time, {$40000.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX, and {$26000.00} ( 3 different loans- {$4000.00}, {$2500.00}, {$20000.00} ). From that day forward, the debt collection calls started coming in by the volumes. I did get ahold of XXXX and they walked me through the dispute process against all of these accounts. I also submitted for a credit freeze for a year with all three credit bureaus. If you look at my credit reports for the past 26 years, you can see that I have always been responsible with my finances. I have plenty of loans that I've taken out and every single one has an excellent pay back history. I understand that these loans were taken out during/after the pandemic/recession times, but I never took a paycheck cut or anything to even need any funding of any type. My credit utilization is 0 % with 0 credit cards and one military charge card. It's not fair to me to have to suffer the wrongdoings of another person, and on top that, when I would request information on the full application to include the identity validation ( verification phone call ), they can't give me supporting evidence. The representative at XXXX told me she couldn't even find me in the system after with my SSN or address. I think that if they had followed a strict process prior to disbursing funds, then this could've all been avoided. Fast forward from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I received notification that XXXX chose to sue me for the amount owed knowing that I was a victim of identity fraud. To make matter worse, the lawsuit paperwork was drafted in XXXX and by the time I received it, my 21 day deadline to respond was already busted. Since these events, I have a 7-yr credit freeze on all the credit bureaus, I've filled out the Identity Theft Report through the FTC and police, and now am waiting for my identity theft passport application to come back from the Attorney General.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","NV","89131","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web",2023-03-20,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6674956,2023
2023-01-04,"Checking or savings account","Savings account","Managing an account","Problem accessing account","Hi, My account at Marcus by Goldman Sachs has been locked for a month. A month ago, I attempted to transfer my money from Marcus to another bank via calling Marcus, and found my account locked the next Monday, without any warning or notification during that call. I called Marcus again, and was told that they would send me a form to fill and send back to them for reviewing. I filled and sent the form immediately after receiving it, and called back to check its status after I saw the tracking status as 'delivered '. This time, I was told that it would take 7 to 10 days after I sent it out for the review. So I waited 7 days and called again. I was told that it was not done yet, and I may call back next Monday. I called on next Wednesday, and was again told that it is not done, and I should wait 7 to 10 days after they receiving the form. Now it is already over a month after my account was locked, and 2 weeks after I sent the form. The form is just for identity confirmation, and I wondered what kind of review process could take over a week ( which is not done yet! ). I also requested for talking to people who is in charge of reviewing, and got rejected.

My experience with Marcus is very unpleasant. First, they should warn me if there is any potential issue when I make the transaction. Second, the whole process takes a very long time from sending the form and reviewing. Third, it is a lot of communication between the department answer my call, the department receiving my form, and the department review my form. Meanwhile, I can only speak to the people on service call, and won't get valid information or direct communication with the reviewing department. Also, the timeline of unlocking my account kept being putting off and no one from Marcus takes responsibility of solving the problem as soon as possible.","","GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA","MA","02115","","Consent provided","Web",2023-01-04,"Closed with explanation","Yes","N/A",6398473,2023
